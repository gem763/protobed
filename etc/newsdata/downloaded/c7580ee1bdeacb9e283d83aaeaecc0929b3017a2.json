You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOutside Waterstones in Piccadilly, hundreds of fans lined up to attend the midnight launch, which was attended by the 79-year-old Canadian author herself.\n\nBookshops all over the world also joined in with launches \u2013 not something experienced since Harry Potter.\n\nNow fans mourning the loss of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale on TV, can get their teeth into a more in-depth look at Gilead, where Offred (played by Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation) has been forced into sexual slavery, after the US government has been overthrown by right-wing religious tyrants. Atwood\u2019s sequel is set 15 years after Offred\u2019s last scene in the original book, in which readers are left wondering whether she escapes or is punished by the regime. The sequel is told through the eyes of Aunt Lydia, the brutal teacher of the fertile Handmaids, whom she rules with an iron rod, as well as through Offred\u2019s two daughters, one of whom escaped to Canada, as a baby.\n\nReviews suggest it is well worth the wait, despite having a lot to live up to. The Independent, who gave it four stars, said \u201cit can and does satisfy our hunger for more. It is an addictively readable, fast-paced adventure about the collapse of Gilead\u201d. Others were disappointed by it, including The Arts Desk, who not only claimed \u201cMost of it reads like a bad YA fiction\u201d, but also that it \u201clacks the slow, fine claustrophobia of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The writing is rushed, with clich\u00e9s patching the gaps to get us from one moment of reaction to another\u201d.\n\nAnother major sequel to be published in the last few years, of course, was Hilary Mantel\u2019s Bring Up the Bodies, the 2012 Booker Prize-winning sequel to the author\u2019s Wolf Hall, which also won the Booker Prize in 2009. While the first book was an account of the speedy rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in Henry VIII\u2019s court, the sequel was just as gripping in its account of Anne Boleyn\u2019s fall, masterminded by Cromwell, after she failed to produce an heir.\n\nIt transformed historical fiction into an art form \u2013 and Mantel is currently writing the final part of the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, which is due out in March 2020. It could be a triple whammy for Mantel, if she wins the Booker Prize again next year.\n\nThe Literary Director of the Booker Prize Foundation, Gaby Wood, who acts as a moderator for the judging panel, tells me that it is essential that the Booker judges view a sequel as a standalone volume.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually no different from the way in which judges have to try and erase the memory of a writer\u2019s earlier books, even if they\u2019re not sequels. Past work can have an unconscious effect on one\u2019s reading of a present one, and judges have to remember that they\u2019re comparing books published this year to each other, not comparing one writer\u2019s new book with his or her backlist,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAs the judges are discussing a sequel, of course one of the questions that comes up \u2013 once you\u2019ve eliminated comparison with past work \u2013 is whether the book works without the earlier volume. Sometimes \u2013 and I can\u2019t name the books because this is largely the reason they never made it to the longlist \u2013 the answer to that is \u2018no\u2019. I think it\u2019s more fair to readers, too \u2013 you don\u2019t want readers to feel inadequate because they haven\u2019t read this or that.\u201d\n\nThe only other sequel to win the Booker was Pat Barker\u2019s The Ghost Road in 1995 \u2013 the third novel in her Regeneration trilogy. Some said at the time that by rewarding the final volume, judges were actually rewarding the trilogy as a whole. But Wood, who wasn\u2019t involved at that time, says this wouldn\u2019t have been the case. \u201cThey certainly would have had to consider the book on its own merit.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director's adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It's the only one of Lynch's films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year\u2019s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better. Universal Pictures 3/26 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma's preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production's many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon's follow-up book, The Devil's Candy. Warner Bros 4/26 Billy Bathgate (1991) 1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow's beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character's narration \u2013 a huge reason behind the novel's success. Buena Vista Pictures 5/26 The Scarlet Letter (1995) The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as \u201ca perfect work of the American imagination,\" the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joff\u00e9 strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne's pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama. Buena Vista Pictures 6/26 Battlefield Earth (2000) To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard\u2019s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in \u201cWorst Movies Ever\u201d infamy, effectively ending Travolta\u2019s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper\u2019s before it even started. Warner Bros Pictures 7/26 Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) Louis de Berni\u00e8res's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version \u2013 from the same British company that made Notting Hill \u2013 lost all traces of the novel's heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake. Miramax Films 8/26 The Time Machine (2002) The beauty of HG Wells\u2019s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells's great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce's lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story. Warner Bros Pictures 9/26 Dreamcatcher (2003) There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film's late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful. Warner Bros Pictures 10/26 Enduring Love (2004) Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u2019s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig\u2019s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed \u2013 the man who becomes obsessed with him \u2013 are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it. Path\u00e9 Distribution 11/26 The Perfect Catch (2005) Nick Hornby adaptations don\u2019t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby\u2019s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a 'girlfriend\u2019 role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby\u2019s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing. 20th Century Fox 12/26 The Da Vinci Code (2006) The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn't have existed had this one not been so successful. Sony Pictures Releasing 13/26 Eragon (2006) 20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation \u2013 one where all of the source materials' sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen. 20th Century Fox 14/26 Running with Scissors (2006) Augusten Burroughs\u2019s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy\u2019s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It\u2019s no wonder this sunk without a trace. TriStar Pictures 15/26 The Golden Compass (2007) In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman\u2019s superb His Dark Materials trilogy \u2013 or rather, the first book Northern Lights \u2013 was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007's The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising. Entertainment Film Distributors 16/26 The Time Traveller's Wife (2009) Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time Traveller's Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there's nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. New Line Cinema 17/26 Cloud Atlas (2012) Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it's meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell's sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it's an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it. Focus Features 18/26 The Hobbit (2012-2014) Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book's material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three. Warner Bros Pictures 19/26 The Book Thief (2013) The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn't help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent. 20th Century Fox 20/26 The Great Gatsby (2013) No adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann's 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald\u2019s delicate story-telling. Warner Bros Pictures 21/26 The Giver (2014) Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katie Holmes) very little to do. The Weinstein Company 22/26 Kill Your Friends (2015) John Niven's Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can't be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows \u2013 the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox. StudioCanal 23/26 The Girl on the Train (2016) Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn\u2019s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance \u2013 and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. Universal Pictures 24/26 Me Before You (2016) The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn't help, either. Clarke's performance as the paid companion to Claflin\u2019s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated. Warner Bros Pictures 25/26 The Dark Tower (2017) While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King's finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared \u2013 but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel's 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Sony Pictures Releasing 26/26 On Chesil Beach (2017) Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

What is astonishing is the way Pullman sustains the story of Lyra into adulthood in his sequel \u2013 although he refers to The Dust Trilogy as an \u201cequel\u201d to His Dark Materials, because it can be read as a stand-alone set of novels, without reading the former series.\n\nComing soon, too, is the follow-up to Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning Olive Kitteridge (2008), titled Olive, Again, which will be published by Viking in October. It follows the next decade of the loveable heroine Olive Kitteridge\u2019s life in the seaside town of Crosby, Maine.\n\nAnother big release this year was Vassily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad (1952), which was published in English for the first time in June. However, it was not really a sequel, but a dazzling prequel to his epic masterpiece of the Soviet experience, Life and Fate (1960), which was first published in English in 1985.\n\nMalorie Blackman\u2019s long-awaited Crossfire, which came out this year, is the latest in her YA series Noughts & Crosses, which \u2013 like The Testaments \u2013 has come after a significant lapse in time since the previous book in the series, Double Cross, in 2008.\n\nIt also took JRR Tolkien a long time to write the sequel to The Hobbit (1937) when he published The Lord of the Rings (1954), which was a roaring success, 17 years later.\n\nJohn Updike kept fans waiting 24 years for his sequel to his 1984 novel The Witches of Eastwick, The Widows of Eastwick, in 2008, which got fairly good reviews.\n\nStephen King\u2019s The Shining was published in 1977; its not-so-famous sequel, Doctor Sleep (2013), followed 36 years later. Joseph Heller\u2019s sequel to Catch-22 (begun in 1953 and published in 1961) arrived a mere 33 years later, but Closing Time (1994) didn\u2019t match the power or impact of the enduring original.\n\nOther famous sequels include JK Rowling\u2019s follow-up to her debut Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (1997). Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was published to great acclaim one year later.\n\nGeorge RR Martin followed A Game of Thrones in 1991 with A Clash of Kings in 1999 \u2013 the first two books which make up A Song of Ice and Fire, which became TV\u2019s Game of Thrones. Fans have been waiting eight years so far for his sixth book in the cycle, Winds of Winter.\n\nAnother big sequel was, of course, Dan Brown\u2019s worldwide bestseller The Da Vinci Code in 2003, which was the sequel to Angels and Demons, which flew off the shelves in 2000. Perhaps its success was partly due to the fact that readers saw both novels as an educational pursuit \u2013 as Brown positioned himself as some kind of authority on Catholicism and art history. But it turned out his version of historical facts and art history wasn\u2019t so correct, and led to accusations of plagiarism, which he defended in court.\n\nBridget Jones\u2019s Diary by Helen Fielding in 1996 which amusingly chronicled the life of a thirty-something single woman in London. Its follow-up, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, published in 1999, was much praised in reviews \u2013 although some picked up on a sense that the genre might be getting tired and Fielding should throw the towel in while she was winning. But the author continued the story in her third novel, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, in 2013 (now she was 51 and on the dating scene) by which point it read more like Jilly Cooper.\n\nSequels in children\u2019s fiction are much more common than in adult books. We\u2019ve had The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain \u2013 which was inspired by The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) \u2013 but considered a defining classic of American literature.\n\nErnest Hemingway, a fan, said: \u201cAll modern literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn\u2026 It\u2019s the best book we\u2019ve had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.\u201d\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964) by Roald Dahl has enthralled children ever since it was published in 1964, but its sequel, Charlie and the Glass Elevator in 1972, was not so memorable. The sequel lost its sense of direction as Charlie and Willy Wonka accidentally zoomed into orbit aboard the glass elevator.\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C S Lewis (1950), which is the best known of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia, was successfully followed by Prince Caspian (1951). Lewis actually didn\u2019t think he would write any more Narnia books after the first, but ended up writing seven in total, over a period of four to five years.\n\nAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) by Lewis Carroll is followed up brilliantly in Alice Through the Looking-Glass (1871), in which the heroine re-enters a fantastical world where everything is reversed \u2013 even logic.\n\nPerhaps much more surprising was the sequel to Louisa May Alcott\u2019s children\u2019s classic Little Women in 1868, which sold out in days. Sadly, Little Men, in 1871, lost the original book\u2019s feminist spirit.\n\nIn 2015, Harper Lee\u2019s \u201csequel\u201d, Go Set A Watchman, was discovered unexpectedly and dubbed a sequel to the Pulitzer Prize-winning To Kill a Mockingbird (1960), a whopping 55 years later. It turned out to be the first draft of To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 and was published with Lee\u2019s consent. It was not the masterpiece that To Kill a Mockingbird became, which arose from her publisher who saw the first draft, directing her to focus more on Scout\u2019s childhood.\n\nSome sequels just don\u2019t work at all. After a 30-year wait, Ira Levin\u2019s sequel to Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1967) \u2013 titled Son of Rosemary (1997) \u2013 in which the son born of Rosemary\u2019s rape by Satan is now a 33-year-old man \u2013 was a total flop.\n\nOther sequels are written by new authors who try to breathe life into somebody else\u2019s work.\n\nThe sequel to Margaret Mitchell\u2019s 1936 novel Gone with the Wind, Scarlett (1991), was written by Alexandra Ripley. It debuted on the New York Times bestsellers list, but it was panned by critics and fans who thought it lacking in the literary prowess of its predecessor.\n\nLikewise, there have been numerous sequels to Jane Austen\u2019s novels. PD James did well to honour Pride and Prejudice so well, with her best-selling sequel, Death Comes to Pemberley, that continues Austen\u2019s story brilliantly with a murder mystery.\n\nRebecca by Daphne du Maurier has a few sequels: Rebecca\u2019s Tale (2001) by Sally Beauman continues the plot and was approved by the Du Maurier estate. Its appeal came from the fact that it revisited the original story \u2013 but from the point of view of Rebecca herself, the first Mrs de Winter, who until now had not had the chance to be heard.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces. 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.\n\nThe Mrs de Winter sequel to Rebecca by Susan Hill in 1993 was panned by some critics \u2013 The Independent who called it a \u201ctimid sequel\u201d said, \u201cEventually we realise that there is nothing here except the old ghosts, dragged out of their dignified retirement and forced to dance again.\u201d\n\nOther sequels worth a mention include The Silence of the Lambs in 1998 by Thomas Harris, which is generally considered his best book and features cannibalistic doctor Hannibal Lecter, first seen in Harris\u2019s 1981 novel, Red Dragon.\n\nThe Mysterious Island (1874) by Jules Verne was the sequel to his Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea in 1870 \u2013 which was arguably Verne\u2019s real masterpiece \u2013 but nevertheless, the sequel concluded many of the stories in the first book.\n\nD H Lawrence\u2019s Women in Love (1920), the sequel to The Rainbow (1915), which two months after publication, was banned for its treatment of sexual desire, follows the continuing loves and lives of the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula \u2013 and is considered to be one of the greatest novels written in English in the 20th century. Lawrence actually intended the two novels to be one, with the working titles The Sisters and The Wedding Ring. But they were published as two separate novels at the request of his publisher. But after the outcry over The Rainbow, he wouldn\u2019t publish the sequel. The sequel was eventually made available only to subscribers because of the controversy caused by The Rainbow and a limited edition of 1,250 book were printed, but like most of his works, most famously Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover in 1928, it continued to cause controversy because of its sexual subject matter.\n\nMeanwhile Ulysses in 1922 by Irish writer James Joyce \u2013 a modern reworking of The Odyssey \u2013 features the character of Stephen Dedalus, first seen in his debut novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which was published in 1916. On the \u201cMost difficult novels\u201d list on Goodreads, Ulysses is ranked in top place for \u201cnovels that make you work the hardest\u201d. But don\u2019t let it put you off \u2013 it\u2019s a fine sequel \u2013 just a weighty one (about 700 pages depending on the edition).\n\nThe Testaments is published by Chatto and Windus, \u00a320", "description": "Finishing a good book always leaves you yearning for more \u2013 but is the sequel ever as good as the original? With the publication of Margaret Atwood\u2019s Booker Prize-shortlisted novel The Testaments on Tuesday (10 September), this is a question every fan of her 1985 dystopian classic The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is wondering.", "authors": ["Charlotte Cripps"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/15/the-testaments.jpg"}
