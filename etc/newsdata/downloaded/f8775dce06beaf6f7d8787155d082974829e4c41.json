(The president is facing a House impeachment investigation for pressuring the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden for allegedly using his office to personally profit.)\n\nMulvaney said Trump is aware that hosting the summit at his own property could raise concerns of impropriety.\n\n\u201cThe president knows that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the environment we live in. He knows exactly he\u2019s going to get that reaction. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019m willing to take that.\u201d\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called the administration\u2019s decision \u201cbrazen\u201d and accused the president of using his office \u201cfor personal financial gain\u201d in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration\u2019s announcement that President Trump\u2019s Doral Miami resort will be the site of the next G7 summit is among the most brazen examples yet of the President\u2019s corruption,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe is exploiting his office and making official U.S. government decisions for his personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nTrump first floated the idea of hosting the G-7 summit at his Florida resort in August, prompting the House Judiciary Committee to look into potential violations of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe president is the sole beneficiary of a trust that now owns his family business. Hosting the summit at the Doral would thus likely put many millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s own cash registers. In a financial disclosure form filed in May, the president claimed to have received $81,417,193 in \u201cincome\u201d from the Florida resort over the previous year.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of his own property for the summit could prove to violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which prohibit federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payments from governments, Nadler and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and civil liberties, said in a statement in August.\n\nNadler said Thursday that the committee would continue investigating the decision for possible violations of the emoluments clauses. But he added: \u201cWe will not allow this latest abuse of power to distract from Congress\u2019 efforts to get to the bottom of the President\u2019s interference in the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s assertion that the Trump resort is obviously the \u201cbest choice\u201d for the summit has also been called into question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dump,\u201d one former White House official, who asked not to be named, said of the Doral.\n\nDuring the Republican National Committee\u2019s meeting at the resort last spring, there were major maintenance issues in evidence.\n\n\u201cAt least one of the guest buildings smelled of mildew, as did its guest rooms,\u201d HuffPost\u2019s S.V. Date reported earlier this year. \u201cThe restaurant on the lower floor in the main lodge had a mustiness tinged with the fraternity house odor of spilled alcohol. Its lap pool\u2019s water was both over-chlorinated and kept at too low a level, making it unpleasant to use for its intended purpose.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler.\n\nS.V.
