It was sheer hell.\u2019\n\nMr Feehan was staying with family in west London at the time of the incident on December 15, 2014, but he has since relocated to `1Waterford, Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis solicitor Jane Walker said: \u2018It was a shocking case of mistaken identity and we were instructed to investigate Stephen\u2019s claim against the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis arising out of an incident in which without warning he suffered substantial injuries, including a fracture to his leg.\n\n\u2018At first, Stephen did not realise he was being accosted by police officers as he had not seen them approach him.\n\n\u2018It was a case of mistaken identity; the police officers thought they were dealing with a different man. They called our client by a different name, but Stephen kept telling the police he was not that person.\n\n\u2018He was arrested and taken to Uxbridge Police Station. By the time he was processed at the police station, the police knew that they had arrested the wrong man.\n\n\u2018Nonetheless, they did not release him; they continued to detain him in custody for a total period of just under 24 hours. He was not taken to hospital for his injuries. The client was eventually released on bail and no further action was taken by the police.\n\n\u2018The police defended the claim, stating lawful force was used to effect a lawful arrest.\n\n\u2018The claim of false imprisonment was denied on the basis that it was necessary to keep Stephen in custody, firstly to verify his identity, and then to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of his conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The police have settled the claim out of court with a five figure sum.\u2019\n\nMr Feehan received \u00a312,000 in compensation, the Mirror reports, but he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think it accounts for the hell I\u2019ve endured.\u2019\n\nA police spokesman said: \u2018The Met confirms the civil claim has been settled out of court. We do not discuss settlement terms.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
