Southbound lanes of the 405 freeway, the busiest highway in the country, were closed.\n\nThe blaze is just 5% contained, and a major Santa Ana wind event is hitting Tuesday night, which firefighters warn could trigger significant blazes.\n\n\"We've seen historically what's happened,\" said Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Jaime Moore, citing the 1961 Bel Air Fire in which over 400 homes were lost.\n\nThe Santa Ana wind event could bring wind gusts up to 80 mph to Southern California on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"So we know the footprint that this fire can make with heavy gusts of wind,\" Moore told ABC News Tuesday morning. \"What we're gonna see tonight, about 11 p.m., as these Santa Ana winds come through ... probably the worst winds Los Angeles has seen in the last two to three years.\"\n\nMoore, defending the decision to evacuate so many residents, warned that the winds could trigger significant fires by stirring up embers and then hurling them one or two miles away.\n\nKincade Fire\n\nMeanwhile, in Northern California, the monster Kincade Fire has been burning since Wednesday night in the heart of wine country.\n\nPhilip Pacheco/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe massive blaze has consumed over 74,000 acres and is 15% contained. The cause is under investigation\n\nLighter winds overnight helped firefighters across the state battle the ongoing blazes, but this will not last long. On Tuesday, winds will increase in Northern California and gust to over 50 mph.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.", "description": "The Getty Fire is just 5% contained.
