If Trump\u2019s fitness for office becomes a viable conversation piece among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, for even just a few weeks next January or during the primaries in February, they will have accomplished something that nobody in politics has even bothered to attempt this campaign year: talking to center-right swing voters who are uncomfortable with the man in the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s the Never Trump line, more or less, with precious time ticking away before the primaries. If some principled Republican can find a few yards of running room, the argument goes, then the myth of Trump\u2019s power, artificially inflated by a loud right-wing media and the architecture of official Washington, will finally be exposed. The \u201ckamikaze mission,\u201d as Hogan put it, is exactly the point. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are queasy about Trump and his divisiveness\u2014they account for anywhere from 17 to 22% of the GOP vote in a recent Quinnipiac poll\u2014will have permission to vote for someone else in the primary, and possibly in the general election. Without the persuadable voters who held their nose for him in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, Trump simply won\u2019t be able to find enough red-capped white people to win next year. \u201cThere is an element of Trump that he\u2019s just somebody walking around with a paper bag full of water,\u201d Stevens argued. \u201cIt won\u2019t leak a lot. But once it goes, it will go.\u201d\u2026\n\nrump will not lose a Republican primary, but Joe Walsh showed last week how he might be sullied by one. Walsh, who by all indications has no real staff or campaign operation, is a professional radio barker who seems intent on attacking the president on his home turf: cable news. During an appearance on the Fox Business Network, Walsh tangled with host Stuart Varney on the question of whether Trump has ever lied. Walsh turned the question on Varney, asking him, \u201cDo you believe he\u2019s ever told the American people a lie?\u201d Varney beclowned himself with his terse answer: \u201cNo.\u201d It was a ridiculous moment on a little-watched network, but Walsh, a performer who loudly supported Trump in 2016, went into the belly of the pro-Trump propaganda machine and curb-stomped one of his lackeys on national television. Democrats can howl about Trump all day long, on any network or platform, but they will never be credible messengers for Republican audiences. Other Republicans, who actually know how to speak Republican, have a different opportunity.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Hamby", "Vanityfair.Com News Never-Trumpers-Republican-Primary-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
