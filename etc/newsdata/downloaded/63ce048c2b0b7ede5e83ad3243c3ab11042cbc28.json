Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg; Photos: Getty\n\nDoing the Most \ufeffis a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it.\n\nGetting the elusive big break in any industry might seem like a pipe dream \u2014 until it actually happens. Below, 25 famous women \u2014 including Lizzo, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Greta Gerwig, and more \u2014 describe the moments when that magical blend of hard work and happenstance took their careers to the next level.\n\n1. Rihanna\n\nOn auditioning for Jay-Z at Def Jam: \u201cThat\u2019s when I really got nervous. I was like: \u2018Oh God, he\u2019s right there, I can\u2019t look, I can\u2019t look, I can\u2019t look!\u2019 I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I\u2019m sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Z. I was star-struck. The audition definitely went well. They [Def Jam] locked me into the office \u2014 till 3 a.m. And Jay-Z said, \u2018There\u2019s only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window\u2019 \u2026 And we were on the 29th floor. Very flattering.\u201d \u2014The Guardian, August 2007\n\n2. Charlize Theron\n\nOn getting her first manager: \u201cI was trying to cash my last check from a modeling job in New York, but because it was an out-of-state check, the bank wouldn\u2019t accept it \u2014 and I really needed the money. So I began pleading with this teller to help me \u2026 If I didn\u2019t cash that check, I wouldn\u2019t have had a place to sleep that night. I said to the teller, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand \u2014 please!\u201d I was begging and pleading, and a gentleman came over and tried to help \u2026 What I didn\u2019t know is that I was auditioning for a guy who would end up being my manager. On the way out, the man who\u2019d helped gave me his card. [He was John Crosby, who represented John Hurt and Rene Russo.] He said, \u2018If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll represent you.\u2019\u201d \u2014Oprah, November 2005\n\n3. Julia Child\n\nOn her first cooking show, The French Chef: \u201cThe first one was in February, 1963 [and it] took off right away \u2026 We all ate what we cooked and just had a good time \u2026 At the very beginning, we were on a shoestring. I think I got $50 per show and we had two cameras. We didn\u2019t stop at all, and if something fell on the floor, it had to stay there.\u201d \u2014Larry King Live, December 2000\n\nWhen the offer was made \u2026 that was one of the happiest days of my whole life. It was a euphoria that I couldn\u2019t understand. \u2014 Awkwafina\n\n4. Awkwafina\n\nOn getting cast in Ocean\u2019s 8: \u201cI remember when the call came in, when the offer was made \u2026 that was one of the happiest days of my whole life. It was a euphoria that I couldn\u2019t understand. I was completely alone. I was in the Beverly Hilton getting ready to win an award at the Kore Asian Media gala. And my mind was blown, dude. I don\u2019t know how to even describe it. A joy that\u2019s overwhelming. I don\u2019t understand how my life came to be.\u201d \u2014BuzzFeed, May 2018\n\n5. Donna Tartt\n\nOn her first hit novel, The Secret History: \u201cI was shocked [by the reaction]. I still am shocked. I really am still puzzled by it \u2026 It\u2019s just very confusing. You know, you work towards something for a number of years and you think you\u2019re going to know what to expect. I thought it would be published, a couple of my friends would read it \u2026 It\u2019s not the fastest thing I ever wrote, but it\u2019s the best thing I ever wrote the fastest. Eight years\u2019 work, and this really was the end, and I\u2019d thought about these characters for so long, and things that I had never seen before started clicking into place.\u201d \u2014Bomb magazine, October 1992\n\n6. Christina Tosi\n\nOn creating her dessert phenomenon, Cereal Milk: \u201cI needed an easy dessert, and a panna cotta is easy to make and easy to serve, but very few people do it with a point of view. I had never had or seen a panna cotta that was a really interesting flavor. I didn\u2019t realize cereal milk [the flavor] was going to be good until I fed it to Dave [Chang]. His eyes just sort of opened and he was like, \u2018Holy shit!\u2019 It became such a hit at [Momofuku] Ko that when we were opening Milk Bar, he said, \u2018You have to make this into a milk, into an ice cream, people are going to go crazy for this.\u2019 That was a huge career-changer for me.\u201d \u2014First We Feast, October 2012\n\n7. Lizzo\n\nOn her song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d appearing in the Netflix film Someone Great: \u201cWho would have thunk? What a moment in a movie can do for an artist is crazy. I had everything else: the hard work, the good music, touring \u2014 but then there\u2019s that extra-special magic that nobody really knows what it is that can really change your life. Now the song that made me want to quit is the song that everyone\u2019s falling in love with me for, which is such a testament to journeys: Your darkest day turns into your brightest triumph.\u201d \u2014People, July 2019\n\n8. Greta Gerwig\n\nOn getting cast in Greenberg: \u201cI have just gotten the role of Florence Marr in Noah Baumbach\u2019s new film Greenberg \u2026 acting opposite Ben Stiller \u2026 This is my actual Big Break. Or that\u2019s what my mom keeps saying. I have done films before, some of them make me proud. I\u2019m not completely green. \u2018But, Greta: it\u2019s BEN STILLER,\u2019 she says. It\u2019s strange that Big Breaks still exist. I think my mom thinks that I\u2019m in There\u2019s Something About Mary 2 \u2026 I touch the script in my purse. I cannot believe that I have this part.\u201d \u2014the Daily Beast, March 2010\n\n9. Billie Eilish\n\nOn her first hit song: \u201cBefore we put out \u2018Ocean Eyes,\u2019 we\u2019d put out two songs \u2014 one that [my brother] Finneas wrote and one that I wrote. Just to put them out on SoundCloud for fun and for our friends to listen to. We had no intention for them. And then we put out \u2018Ocean Eyes.\u2019 It kind of just started getting traction. I would hit refresh and it would have a bunch of new plays. We were like, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019 I was at Starbucks one time, and Finneas called, like, \u2018Dude! Our song got 1,000 plays. We made it.\u2019 We were just so over the moon about it getting 1,000 plays. We were like, that\u2019s it. We\u2019ve reached our goal. We thought we were bosses. And then it just kept going. And then Hillydilly found it \u2026 I didn\u2019t realize how big it was getting until it had reached 50,000 plays. I haven\u2019t really processed it. It\u2019s just hard because it doesn\u2019t happen to everyone, and it\u2019s rare.\u201d \u2014Vogue, August 2016\n\n10. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nOn her first book deal: \u201cI was completely unknown. I wrote short stories, got many rejections and then finally got an acceptance. I wrote a large and terrible novel that I sent out and that was rejected multiple times. And then I wrote Purple Hibiscus and a nice agent said she would \u2018take a chance on me.\u2019\u201d \u2014The Guardian, August 2016\n\n11. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nOn being nominated for office: \u201cI was nominated at first by a group called Justice Democrats \u2026 They were looking for people with a history of community service and my name had come across their desk, and they called. I had actually just gotten off of camp at Standing Rock. I was there with the Lakota Sioux and all of the Native peoples that were really standing up to protect the water supply in the Midwestern United States. That experience was very personally important and transformative, and I kind of left feeling like I had to do more, and I didn\u2019t know what that was. When I got that call, I just felt like, \u2018OK, the universe is telling me something, so I\u2019m going to listen\u2019 \u2026 Nobody\u2019s ever supposed to win their first bid for office. Nobody\u2019s ever supposed to win without taking lobbyists\u2019 money, no one\u2019s ever supposed to defeat an incumbent, no one\u2019s ever supposed to run a grassroots campaign without running any ads on television. We did all of those things.\u201d \u2014Elle, July 2018\n\n12. Betty White\n\nOn her first talk-show gig: \u201cMy big break came when a local disc jockey, Al Jarvis, in Los Angeles invited me to be his Girl Friday on his talk show \u2018Hollywood On Television\u2019 \u2014 so would I be his Girl Friday? Sure, Friday, that\u2019s great. Well, what he meant and I didn\u2019t realize was Friday, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Five-and-a-half hours a day, six days a week live \u2014 whatever happened, you had to handle it. There was never any rehearsal or script or anything. Whoever came in that door, it was on, and you were interviewing them.\u201d \u2014NPR, November 2014\n\n13. Nancy Dubuc, CEO of VICE\n\nOn working her way up the ladder: \u201cWhen you reach success, there\u2019s this leap that people make that, \u2018Oh. You just got here,\u2019 and they forget the 20 years \u2014 the 15 years of [when] I was a post-production supervisor. I was a PA. I was an AP. I was a director of programming. I was 85 other jobs before I got here \u2026 You start by getting coffee.\u201d \u2014Fearless Podcast, April 2019\n\n14. Cardi B\n\nOn getting cast on Love & Hip Hop: \u201cYo, it\u2019s so crazy, like, them motherfuckers [the producers] really doubted me. It\u2019s like, why would y\u2019all doubt me? Like, I have seven hundred thousand bajillion followers [on Instagram]. I\u2019m telling them like, \u2018Yo, I have a brand. I\u2019m not even a[n] artist and I fill out clubs. Three thousand, whatever the crap, I fill them shits out!\u2019 But they didn\u2019t care about that. They just wanted to make me look as the stripper, a struggling stripper.\u201d \u2014The Fader, February 2016\n\n15. Julia Louis-Dreyfus\n\nOn joining Saturday Night Live when she was 21: \u201cI did not adapt well. I was pretty miserable. It was a very difficult time of my life \u2014 it really was. I went into that place green as green could be. I mean, I came out of a theater background, improv background, that was very ensemble-y and we\u2019re doing this together and we\u2019re in it together, which is great. But that\u2019s not necessarily the culture at SNL when I was there at all. It was very dog-eat-dog \u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to work the system at all. Plus, there were a lot of drugs, and I didn\u2019t realize everyone was on drugs \u2026 so I was a little bit na\u00efve. But, it was sort of like grad school in a way. I really learned a lot about the business in that period of time and I met Larry David. Larry was there my third year. He never got a sketch on the air. We sort of became friends because we both sort of identified with each others\u2019 misery. So that was a lucky thing!\u201d \u2014Entertainment Weekly SiriusXM, September 2013\n\nI quit my day job selling fax machines on Oct. 14, 2000, and Oprah called two weeks later. \u2014 Sara Blakely\n\n16. Sara Blakely\n\nOn founding Spanx: \u201cI said, OK, I want to invent or create a product that I can sell that\u2019s my own and not somebody else\u2019s, and I want it to be something I can sell to millions of people. And I want it to be something that makes people feel good. I wrote that specifically in my journal, and I just kept looking for when it was going to show up in my life. I was on high alert. The day I cut the feet out of my pantyhose, I immediately started pursuing it \u2026 I quit my day job selling fax machines on Oct. 14, 2000, and Oprah called two weeks later. I was on her show in November. I\u2019d been working full time while I was working on [Spanx] at night and on weekends. I didn\u2019t want to quit my job. I needed the income and the security and the insurance and the health benefits and all that. So I literally waited. I did not leave my job until I\u2019d already landed Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. That was when I got the courage to make the leap and go on my own.\u201d \u2014Success, January 2015\n\n17. Tara Westover\n\nOn the success of her memoir, Educated: \u201cI remember thinking when I was writing this that the book would really do well for little girls who worked in junk yards and never went to school. For everybody else, it would be a bit inaccessible \u2026 It came in on the New York Times best-seller list at No. 1, so right away it was doing well. But you still don\u2019t know. That could be a blip. You think that it can\u2019t sustain \u2026 The book has sold better than I could ever have expected. Honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve processed it. I can\u2019t even tell you. In a year, maybe I could tell you. I\u2019m super-confused by it myself.\u201d \u2014Parade, February 2019\n\n18. Zendaya Coleman\n\nOn her first big TV role: \u201cMy dad took a sabbatical from his job as a PE teacher to help me with my career, and we started commuting to Los Angeles for castings and auditions. We were driving back and forth from my home in Oakland to L.A. every week. It was six-hour drives all the time. They would call us at 4 p.m. and say they needed me by 9 a.m. the next day so we would pack our bags and just go \u2026 It was tough. But after a year it really paid off when I got the role of Rocky in Shake It Up at the age of 13. That was my big break.\u201d \u2014Fun Kids, 2011\n\nI felt like dancing, but instead I ordered a BLT pizza from Pizzeria Mozza, extra bacon. \u2014 Ellie Kemper\n\n19. Zadie Smith\n\nOn her first novel, White Teeth: \u201cWhy would anyone assume that a 500-page novel about Willesden Green would sell? It\u2019s the ongoing shock of my life. In one way, I\u2019m incredibly grateful. The money meant \u2014 and has meant \u2014 that I can write as I like. I can write a book of essays, or I can write books that are somewhat strange. My publishers are patient with me \u2026 To me [now] it\u2019s a book by a different person, and it\u2019s not to my taste. But I will say, now that I\u2019ve grown, I can look back and think, Okay, it\u2019s okay for a 22-year-old. It is what it is. It\u2019s full of flaws but I think fondly of that 22-year-old who wrote it. Whereas before she filled me with total horror.\u201d \u2014Interview, August 2012\n\n20. Ellie Kemper\n\nOn getting cast in The Office: \u201cI could not believe it! The odds of booking a role on any show, anywhere, are so small \u2014 and this was a show that I happened to worship. I felt like dancing, but instead I ordered a BLT pizza from Pizzeria Mozza, extra bacon.\u201d \u2014My Squirrel Days, October 2018\n\n21. Mary Barra\n\nOn her first job at General Motors, where she is now chairwoman and CEO: \u201cMy first experience [working at a GM assembly plant during college] was perhaps the most significant \u2014 and what I would consider my big break. I started as a quality inspector on the assembly line at Pontiac Motor Division. It was terrific because I learned how cars were built and how important every step of the assembly process was to make a great car.\u201d \u2014LinkedIn, September 2016\n\n22. Issa Rae\n\nOn getting discovered by Hannibal Buress online: \u201cI remember during [the] third or fourth episode of our series \u2018Awkward Black Girl,\u2019 I got a tweet from Hannibal Buress. He said, \u2018Hey, I really like your stuff. My manager manages Donald Glover and other people. Do you want me to put you in touch?\u2019 And I was like \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d \u2014the Wrap, July 2016\n\n23. Gayle King\n\nOn her first on-air job: \u201cI went to the University of Maryland, and I was working at a camera store that was next to the TV station, and these muckety-mucks would come in from the TV station \u2026 One of them turned out to be a news director. And he said, \u2018You know, you have such a nice way about you, and a really nice voice. Have you ever thought about TV news?\u2019 [I said,] \u2018No, actually I haven\u2019t.\u2019 [And he said,] \u2018Well, we have an entry-level position, might you be interested?\u2019 And my response was, \u2018Do I have to work weekends?\u2019 \u2026 So I got this job in the newsroom.\u201d \u2014Sooo Many White Guys, April 2018\n\n24. Alicia Keys\n\nOn signing her first record deal: \u201cMy manager put together these showcases so that the heads of various labels could hear me play. They were all interested, so we had a bidding war. Columbia brought me in to play in this gorgeous building that looks out over Manhattan. I was on, like, the 579th floor with this white piano. The whole room was white and glass, and I\u2019d never seen anything like it. I was like \u2018Wow.\u2019 So I played my little songs and everyone was excited. I was in heaven. Then the exec cleared everybody out and said to me, \u2018If you sign with us, I\u2019ll give you this piano.\u2019 All I had at home was my broken-down room divider. He might as well have been offering me diamonds.\u201d \u2014Oprah, September 2004\n\n25. Alli Webb\n\nOn founding Drybar: \u201cI stayed home for five years with my kids before I started to get an itch to enter the workplace again. I missed talking to adults and I thought it would be a good way to get out of the house, socialize and have a nice side business. Because I had spent years blow-drying hair, I decided to start a mobile blowout business called Straight-At-Home. It was really that simple when I got started \u2026 I posted information on a mommy blog that basically said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m opening up a business, we specialize in blow-drying hair and are thinking about charging $35 or $40. Would anybody be interested?\u201d I got flooded with emails from women all over town who loved the idea. At the time it was less about the money and more about getting out of the house. I got so busy so fast! I would stay at these womens\u2019 homes after I blew out their hair for another half hour just chatting. It was fulfilling for me at the time, however, I got so busy that I ended up at a crossroad: bring more people on to fill the demand or open a physical location.\u201d \u2014Career Contessa, October 2013", "description": "Twenty-five famous women \u2014 including Rihanna, Charlize Theron, Julia Child, and more \u2014 discuss the big break that took their career to the next level.", "authors": ["Julie Ma"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/06/post_it_template_25_big_break_rev.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
