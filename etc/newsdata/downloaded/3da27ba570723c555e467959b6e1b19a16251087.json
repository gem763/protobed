It reported that the mob had consisted \u201cmostly of the best element\u201d of New Orleans society. The following day, a scabrous Times editorial justified the lynching \u2014 and dehumanized the dead, with by-now-familiar racist stereotypes\u2026\n\nPresident Harrison would have ignored the New Orleans carnage had the victims been black. But the Italian government made that impossible. It broke off diplomatic relations and demanded an indemnity that the Harrison administration paid. Harrison even called on Congress in his 1891 State of the Union to protect foreign nationals \u2014 though not black Americans \u2014 from mob violence.\n\nHarrison\u2019s Columbus Day proclamation in 1892 opened the door for Italian-Americans to write themselves into the American origin story, in a fashion that piled myth upon myth. As the historian Danielle Battisti shows in \u201cWhom We Shall Welcome,\u201d they rewrote history by casting Columbus as \u201cthe first immigrant\u201d \u2014 even though he never set foot in North America and never immigrated anywhere (except possibly to Spain), and even though the United States did not exist as a nation during his 15th-century voyage. The mythologizing, carried out over many decades, granted Italian-Americans \u201ca formative role in the nation-building narrative.\u201d It also tied Italian-Americans closely to the paternalistic assertion, still heard today, that Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d a continent that was already inhabited by Native Americans.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brent Staples", "Nytimes.Com Interactive Opinion Columbus-Day-Italian-American-Racism.Html Action Click Module Opinion Pgtype Homepage"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
