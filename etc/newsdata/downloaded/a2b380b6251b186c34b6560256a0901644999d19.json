The paper hails an agreement \"at last\" of an early general election.\n\nImage caption Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is depicted as the Grinch trying to steal the prime minister's Christmas in a cartoon on the front of the Daily Mail. The tabloid takes on the government's rhetoric by saying opposition parties backed an election only after weeks of \"dither and delay\".\n\nImage caption But the joke is on the PM in the Daily Mirror, where Mr Johnson's head appears superimposed onto a turkey. The paper says a Christmas election gives voters a chance to \"axe reckless Boris Johnson\" and thus \"stuff the turkey\". It says a Labour government would overturn austerity.\n\nImage caption The Daily Telegraph opts for a rather less imaginative headline. Under a picture of the shadow cabinet, the paper says Mr Corbyn's decision to \"finally bow\" to the PM's demands for an election gives the nation a change to \"clear the Brexit impasse that has crippled politics\".\n\nImage caption The Sun's headline pun plays on New Year rather than Christmas, hailing 1 January 2020 as the \"first day of the rest of our lives\" if Mr Johnson manages to \"win a decent mandate\" in the election and therefore push his Brexit deal through Parliament.\n\nImage caption Mr Johnson's decision to recall rebel Tory MPs shortly before a vote on the poll date was an attempt to \"heal party wounds\" ahead of a potentially \"tight and volatile\" general election, the FT says. The PM will tell the former rebels he will campaign as a centrist Conservative.\n\nImage caption The Guardian agrees with the FT, claiming the election will be \"the most unpredictable contest in a generation\". The paper says the PM told a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be \"a tough election but we will do the best we can\".\n\nImage caption Mr Johnson smiles out from the i's front page as the \"countdown begins\" - it's 43 days until the general election. The paper draws attention to fears from some that turnout from voters could be low, in the first December election since 1923.\n\nImage caption The Daily Express is one of several papers claiming Brexit will be the only issue the electorate will vote on. It says Britain will vote \"once and for all to deliver Brexit\". It adds the PM got the go-ahead for the poll after Mr Corbyn \"caved in\" on the idea.\n\nImage caption The PM says an election is needed because another Brexit delay would \"seriously\" damage the national interest, the Times says. But the paper adds the PM's allies say he has risked a backlash from voters by not delivering on his \"do or die\" pledge to make Brexit happen by 31 October.\n\nImage caption Departing from politics, the Daily Star's front page blasts Swansea Council for banning a gig by Roy Chubby Brown because it was \"unlikely to reflect our values and commitments\". The \"snowflake\" decision has sparked backlash from his fans, the paper says.\n\nThe front pages give a flavour of the bitter Christmas election battle to come.\n\nThe Mail portrays Boris Johnson as Santa Claus on his sleigh, with Jeremy Corbyn as Dr Seuss's Grinch taking presents out of the back.\n\n\"Don't let the Grinch steal your Christmas\" is the Mail's headline, which is coupled with a warning that both the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party could threaten the prime minister's opinion poll lead.\n\nThe Daily Mirror, by contrast, puts Mr Johnson's head on a turkey and urges voters to \"stuff him\" and in doing so end what it says is a decade of Tory austerity and unnecessary hardship.\n\nImage copyright skynesher/Getty Images Image caption From \"stuff the turkey\" to \"New Year's Leave\", the papers are crammed with festive puns about the December general election\n\nIn the Telegraph, a commentary by a columnist, Sherelle Jacobs, takes up much of its front page. She thinks remainers in Parliament have cooked their own goose by giving Mr Johnson an election.\n\nShe relishes the idea that Blairite \"conviction politicians\" in thumping Leave seats are about to be punished by lifelong Labour voters - and, drawing on a phrase associated with Donald Trump, says the election presents an opportunity to \"drain the swamp\".\n\nBut in its editorial, the Guardian presents a different picture. It argues MPs voted for Brexit last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement and the PM could have pushed to get the deal through the Commons.\n\nIt says the prime minister is trying to manipulate opinion to give the impression the election is for the benefit of the people, rather than for his benefit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Anti-Brexit campaigners outside Parliament will have to conjure Christmas signage once Halloween has passed\n\nMr Johnson's failure to meet his original \"do-or-die\" Halloween Brexit deadline is one of the reasons why the Economist thinks the election is a \"big gamble\" for his party.\n\nBut it identifies other dangers for Mr Johnson too, including a decline in party loyalty; an increase in tactical voting; the potential loss of Tory seats in London, the south-west and Scotland; and the election being fought on public services rather than on Brexit.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nGaining the support of \"the Workington man\" will be key to Mr Johnson's success, according to many papers which highlight a study by the think-tank, Onward.\n\nThe Times says he will have to target older white men without degrees living in the Rugby League towns of the north of England. But it warns that to do so the Tories will have to develop a new Conservatism prioritising public spending.\n\nThe Mail reflects anger among some of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire that the London Fire Brigade Commissioner, Dany Cotton, is to retire at the age of 50 with a \u00a32m pension pot despite being strongly criticised by the public inquiry into the tragedy.\n\nBut the Guardian highlights the view of some firefighters that their unpreparedness was the result of a \u00a3100m cut to the brigade's budget as well as decades of decentralisation of fire safety.", "description": "Parliament's support for a 12 December general election is met with varied reaction in the papers.", "authors": ["Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16D0F/production/_109455439_metro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
