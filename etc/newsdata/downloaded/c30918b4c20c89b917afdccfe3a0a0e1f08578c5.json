Sloths can fall 100 feet without injury\n\nDavid Attenborough with a sloth in 1963\n\nSloths are anatomically designed to fall out of trees. On average, a sloth will fall out of a tree once a week for its entire life. But don't worry, all sloths are anatomically designed to fall and survive \u2014 they can plummet from over 100 feet without injury (that\u2019s the height of twelve double-decker buses). When two sloths fight it is typically over access to a female for mating, and the aim of a sloth fight is to knock your opponent out of the tree.\n\n9. They could cure cancer\n\nSloths have an unusual method of camouflage \u2014 cracks in their hair allow many different species of algae and fungi to grow which makes them appear green. Some species of fungi living in sloth fur have been found to be active against certain strains of bacteria, cancer and parasites! Sloth hair also provides home to an entire ecosystem of invertebrates \u2060\u2014 some species of which are found nowhere else on earth (like the \u2018sloth moth\u2019). A single sloth can host up to 950 moths and beetles within its fur at once.\n\n10. No one knows how long they live for\n\nBecause sloths are so difficult to study in the wild, no one has ever followed an individual from birth until death and it is virtually impossible to accurately determine the age of an adult sloth. All we have to go on is the lifespan in captivity, but sloths do not do well outside of their natural environment. The oldest known sloth in the world just turned 50 years old and she lives at a zoo in Germany. We suspect that wild sloths actually live for much longer than this, but only time will tell.", "description": "True facts about your favourite languid, tree-hugging mammal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07rdc1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
