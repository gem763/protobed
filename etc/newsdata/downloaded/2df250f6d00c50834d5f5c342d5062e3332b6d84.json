Every decade has a look. True, in each case this is an appalling oversimplification. Flares did not rule the whole of the 70s, for instance: by the summer of 1978, Sandy was rocking wet-look drainpipes in Grease. So to put your head above the parapet and attempt to skewer the look of the decade before that decade is even over is, clearly, madness.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to do it anyway, so here goes. For a certain type of woman in the decade that is now drawing to a close, the unspoken style ideal was to look like you worked in the art world. This involved interesting neutrals (mostly navy for the first half of the decade, grey and beige the second) with sophisticated, painterly accent colours such as mustard or fuchsia. It meant a sihouette that was de-centred, abstracted from the shape of the body below. It called for unfussy pieces with intriguing details: a simple dress with a statement sleeve, for instance. There was little skin on show: there were a lot of funnel necks, then polos, and skirts were below the knee for most of the decade. There were elements of menswear \u2013 blazers, tailored trousers, unisex white trainers or Gucci loafers \u2013 but these were mixed with feminine silk blouses rather than styled in a performatively androgynous Annie Hall kind of way. For evening, tight black dresses languished unworn in favour of elevated, accessorised versions of the daywear look, or bold dresses with a certain flamboyance of colour or print or silhouette.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor to the Frieze art fair in 2016 looks around the Hans op de Beeck installation. Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian\n\nAn observer noticing this woman as she crossed the road on her way to work \u2013 she probably had earphones in to listen to a podcast, this decade, rather than being on the phone \u2013 would have clocked her interestingly textured funnel-neck sweater, French-tucked behind the fly button of wide-legged trousers which in turn were cropped to show, perhaps, a flash of white ankle boot. This observer might have imagined her headed to a job in a private gallery, perhaps. She wasn\u2019t power-dressed in a Working Girl kind of way, but neither was she tricked out and dolled up in a ladies-who-lunch kind of way. She had a job, she had purpose and discipline, but she wasn\u2019t part of the machine.\n\nI say she, but of course I\u2019m really talking about me, and I\u2019m very likely talking about you, too. A couple of years ago, I was telling a friend about a loose, sweeping Valentino dress in dark, wanton florals I\u2019d fallen in love with and wanted to buy for a birthday party. I was trying to explain what was so fabulous about it, and why I so desperately wanted it despite being able to neither afford nor justify the price tag. \u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026 ceramicist with a private income,\u201d was the phrase that came out of my mouth, as I reached for a definition. She knew exactly what I meant. And she immediately agreed with me that I needed the dress.\n\nHow did \u201cceramicist with a private income\u201d become a cipher for glamour? How did \u201cen route to install an exhibition\u201d come to be a more aspirational vibe than \u201cmani-pedi appointment followed by lunch at Daphne\u2019s\u201d? Well, for a start, this decade has seen the art world expand and transform, from a prestigious but niche industry into a pop culture arena of big money, glamorous travel, blue chip status and boundless individuality. In 2000 there were 55 art fairs around the world; in 2018 there were 260. (In London, the weeks of the Frieze art fair surpass pre-Christmas as the busiest time of year at department store Dover Street Market.) Fashion and art have not been so close since the days of Elsa Schiaparelli and Salvador Dal\u00ed. Being \u201cin the art world\u201d has come to mean Instagrammable Venice water taxis, Roksanda\u2019s catwalk shows at the Serpentine Pavilion, Erdem eveningwear and Marni earrings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Toast\u2019s cotton twill workwear jacket in cobalt blue echoes the jackets worn by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet in their studios.

Art has snowballed in cultural value as exponentially as its cash stock has risen. As our culture has become ever more visual \u2013 Instagram is the pop radio of our times \u2013 the status of art, which stands at the apex of our aesthetics, has soared. What\u2019s more, the mood music of the art world is perfect for now. Authenticity, a buzzword of this decade, is rooted in art. Individuality and creativity are honoured in art. And don\u2019t get me started on the word \u201ccurate\u201d, which 10 years ago was an activity specific to museums and galleries but has become the verb du jour, applied to arranging your wardrobe, or laying the table for supper.\n\nArt world chic stalked the runways this season. At Bottega Veneta, the elegant but just-slightly-off proportions \u2013 a scoop-neck cream crop sweater with a gold chain trim, worn with the softest leather trousers \u2013 had fans of Phoebe Philo\u2019s era at Celine swooning. At Loewe, the chic understatement of a navy silk gown with a boxy, vest-like cut was catnip to an artfully-aligned audience. At Jacquemus, a sculptural camisole half-tucked into crisp tailored trousers had that insider wink of refined chic. Nothing obviously splashy to see here; but to the trained eye, this is perfection nonetheless.\n\nA close alignment with the art world has been a key element in how matchesfashion.com has evolved into a uniquely sophisticated multibrand retailer. Natalie Kingham, fashion and buying director, has long held a chic curator in mind as an imaginary muse. Throughout 2019, the site has partnered with Frieze, hosting salons and pop-ups in tandem as the art fair travels around the world\u2019s most fashionable cities. This is not just about selling dresses to wealthy art collectors, or about using art as inspiration for your look, but about life imitating art \u2013 specifically, the most fashionable life imitating an art-world kind of life. The matchesfashion.com townhouse at 5 Carlos Place in London is designed to feel \u201clike the ultimate collector\u2019s house, where we can host and entertain you, have original conversations and create memorable experiences,\u201d says Jess Christie, chief brand officer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor to Frieze in New York, 2017.

Cos is as central a pillar of this aesthetic as Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine ever was. \u201cArt is ahead of fashion,\u201d says Cos creative director Karin Gustafsson. \u201cArtists reflect their surroundings, and so art tells us where the world is going.\u201d The label on the inside can be an important badge \u2013 old Celine, as designed by Phoebe Philo, was certainly something of an old-school tie for the art sorority \u2013 but the surface is less about logo than texture and quality, and the more elevated high street brands have worked hard at securing loyalty from this customer. \u201cThe quality, the weight, the feel of fabric are extremely important,\u201d says Hannah Gruy, who handles artist liaison at White Cube gallery and whose chic wardrobe saw her featured in a 2012 New York Times article about disciples of Philo, \u201cbut that\u2019s not just Celine or The Row.\u201d And while an \u201carty\u201d slant on chic was once the province of women of a certain age, it has spread to a younger demographic. \u201cWe have always done this look,\u201d says Toast designer Suzie de Rohan Willner of the brand\u2019s aesthetic, which she characterises as \u201ca mix of workwear, traditional craft and contemporary silhouette\u2026 It works at any age, but I am seeing more younger customers.\u201d\n\nA look that is, by definition, highly sophisticated is hard to pin down. Often the stamp of authenticity is in the detail, in nuances of thought process, which are a dog whistle to only a certain audience. The morning I speak to Gruy, for instance, she is on her way to \u201ca meeting with someone externally from the gallery, so although it\u2019s raining today, I chose my fancier Celine raincoat, rather than my Uniqlo raincoat.\u201d Our visual culture may have spawned Love Island at one extreme, but it has also facilitated the emergence of a culturally aware, aesthetically literate audience for both fashion and art. \u201cFashion on its own isn\u2019t enough any more,\u201d says creative director Alex Eagle, a best-dressed list fixture and tastemaker across art and fashion, whose store in London\u2019s Soho stocks a chic edit in all categories from the perfect one-piece swimsuit to gorgeous modern ceramics. \u201cPeople are craving a more 360-degree view on culture,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cArtists aren\u2019t slaves to fashion,\u201d says taxidermy artist Polly Morgan. \u201cI\u2019ve always really liked fashion, but I\u2019ve never bought a fashion magazine in my life.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taxidermy artist Polly Morgan in her apartment in Hackney. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not literal,\u201d says Gustafsson of how Cos interprets an artistic sensibility into clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s not about clothes that look like paintings, or anything like that.\u201d The first principles of Cos are colour \u2013 a foundation colour card of white, black, navy, sky blue, grey and beige \u2013 and a subtle silhouette which is \u201cabout proportion and the way volume sits around the body\u201d. Designer Francesca Amfitheatrof, alumna of Tiffany and Wedgwood, and now artistic director of jewellery and watches at Louis Vuitton, points to how \u201ca twist in the detail \u2013 an elongated cuff, an extra-long trouser, a raised neckline\u201d \u2013 can be crucial in art-oriented fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the obvious,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes what Nicholas [Ghesqui\u00e8re] does at Vuitton so compelling \u2013 it takes you a while to get it. It\u2019s not immediate, and that\u2019s part of what makes it so great.\u201d\n\nThe principles of art-oriented fashion are situated at the point where lifestyle and attitude meet aesthetics. It\u2019s a look that combines purpose \u2013 these are clothes for a woman with a purpose beyond being decorative \u2013 with a sense of freedom, or at least autonomy. There is an informality to the soft, sculptural shapes, but \u201cit\u2019s not holiday, or hippy\u201d, Amfitheatrof says. \u201cIt\u2019s for a woman who has plans, and ambitions. You look at certain types of clothes and you think, that\u2019s beautiful, but it doesn\u2019t relate to my life,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis look speaks to women and how they really live.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All about the crucial details \u2026 design director of Tiffany & Co Francesca Amfitheatrof in 2016. Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Tiffany & Co.\n\nLucia Wood, head of design at Jigsaw, is passionate about designing for a modern, culturally informed woman and believes that \u201clifestyle isn\u2019t so clearcut any more. It\u2019s not about a division between the career woman and the stay-at-home mum. Working doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you are at the same office all week, so our clothes are about flexibility, and curating a wardrobe.\u201d\n\nFor Gruy, \u201cmy work and non-work wardrobes are pretty blended. Flat shoes are essential, because at art fairs you are on your feet all day. And if I go to an event after work that\u2019s more often than not spontaneous, so I rely on red lipstick.\u201d At the Venice Biennale, Amfitheatrof regularly walks 20km in a day. \u201cYou are on a boat, off a boat, so you need flat shoes and you need a jacket,\u201d she says firmly. In a decade in which female empowerment has been a narrative of both fashion and art, \u201cwomen in the art world are finding their voice\u201d, Amfitheatrof says, \u201cand there is a sense of not dressing for men. This is not a world where you have your cleavage on show.\u201d\n\nAgain, principle and practicality overlap. \u201cI like nice clothes, but I don\u2019t prioritise getting dolled up,\u201d Morgan shrugs. \u201cI just don\u2019t see that as an important enough way to be spending my time.\u201d\n\nPhilo\u2019s departure from Celine last year left something of a power vacuum here. \u201cThere has definitely been a period of mourning for Phoebe,\u201d Amfitheatrof says. \u201cShe\u2019s not easy to replace because she always thought laterally, and she had such a singular point of view.\u201d In the post-Philo era, the art-oriented look has continued its trajectory toward being cleaner and crisper than the floatiness with which bohemian dressing was once associated. The magnetic pull of Scandinavian style and design can be seen here, just as it can in the architecture and interior design choices of the same tastemakers, who over the past decade have ditched colourful shabby chic for pale wood and clean lines.\n\nUtility is becoming a buzzword in fashion, with jumpsuits that look ever closer to overalls, and apron and pinafore styling on dresses. At Toast, a key piece for this autumn is \u201ca French jacket in workwear blue, with Japanese styling. The timelessness of those designs feels subversive,\u201d de Rohan Willner says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine was \u2018an old-school tie for the art sorority\u2019 \u2026 she is pictured here at Paris fashion week after the spring/summer 2016 show. Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images\n\nIn art and in fashion, beauty is prized. \u201cI want a sense of ease in a dress, but I also want it to make you look beautiful,\u201d de Rohan Willner adds. \u201cI care about the fabric but I also want the collarbone to be enhanced by the neckline, for instance.\u201d A high-profile art moment like the Venice Biennale, Amfitheatrof says, is \u201cnot an easy pack. You need dressed-up pieces for evening. There are some brands, like Louis Vuitton and Alexander McQueen, that work really well in the art world because they are not just adornment but are part of a richer conversation.\u201d\n\nTextile designer and art world style icon Tiphaine de Lussy favours Roksanda, for her bold elegance and as a designer who \u201chas a real interest in and connection to art\u201d. Morgan, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t like \u201cfussy things. I wear my boilersuit in the studio, and in the evening I dress like an Italian businessman in a cashmere coat and tailored trousers.\u201d\n\nThere is room for all these points of view, in this wardrobe. This season, the chic art world customer may be buying artisanal statement pieces by Simone Rocha, Loewe, Hillier Bartley or By Walid, or investing in minimalism by Jil Sander, Raey or Gabriela Hearst. \u201cThe art world is a world that tolerates difference among women,\u201d de Lussy says. \u201cAnd perhaps there\u2019s something empowering and aspirational in that.\u201d", "description": "As culture has become more visual, clothes that speak of galleries, exhibitions and artist studios have found widespread appeal", "authors": ["Jess Cartner-Morley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32bce3165a971520e88f7497a519c6430423298f/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd0765bda7df34467e829802767c8a4a", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
