But they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cThat person doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Johnson said when a reporter asked about Trump\u2019s story after the president\u2019s controversial speech on Monday to police chiefs in Chicago, which Johnson did not attend. (See the video above at 10:05.)\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re all adults here,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump first claimed to have met the unidentified super cop while he was campaigning for president \u2014 in an earlier retelling, Trump said the man claimed he could \u201cstraighten out\u201d the city in one day, or \u201cso quickly that your head would spin.\u201d\n\nThe president referred to him again during his speech on Monday, though he hedged on the timeline. \u201cOne day, one week or one month \u2014 there was no doubt he could have done it,\u201d he declared.\n\nMonday marked Trump\u2019s first visit to Chicago as president \u2014 an opportunity he used to trash the city. Johnson staunchly defended his police force after the president blasted Chicago as more dangerous than Afghanistan.\n\nJohnson pointed out that Trump had no problem relying on the very same police force he criticized in his remarks. \u201cThe same police officers the president criticized for their inability to protect this city spent all day protecting him,\u201d the superintendent noted.\n\nHe also cited Trump\u2019s boast about falling crime rates in the nation. Johnson said that it was Chicago that \u201cset the table\u201d for the trend. The city has had \u201cdouble-digit reductions in the last three years\u201d in major crimes, Johnson said.\n\nMuch still needs to be done in the city, Johnson acknowledged, but he said he was \u201cexceptionally proud of the work being done by the 13,400 men and women of the Chicago Police Department.\u201d The Trump administration has \u201churt many communities in Chicago, but CPD is here and will always be here to stand up for them,\u201d he vowed.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators hit the streets to protest Trump\u2019s visit to Chicago, chanting \u201cLock him up!\u201d and calling for his impeachment.\n\nIt's no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city. \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 28, 2019", "description": "\"Look, we're all adults here,\" scoffed Eddie Johnson at a press conference where he blasted the president's attacks on the city.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db76c1e210000193534b4c7.jpeg?cache=lzsqw7okkv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
