News reports say that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on his potential election rival, Joe Biden. Trump says the problem is Biden, who shut down a Ukrainian investigation into his son when he was vice president.\n\nMy advice: Don\u2019t believe that Ukrainian officials ever did \u2013 or will do \u2013 the Americans\u2019 bidding in such a politically charged situation. Corruption investigations tend to get nowhere in Europe\u2019s second-most-corrupt country (after Russia). And if there\u2019s one thing Ukrainian leaders understand, it\u2019s that they can\u2019t afford to take sides in U.S. politics.\n\nTrump tweeted early Monday morning that Biden \u201cforced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201creal story\u201d contradicts the known facts. And even if Zelenskiy wanted to help the U.S. president advance his theory, he couldn\u2019t credibly do it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some history. In April 2014, the then-vice president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, became a generously paid board member of Burisma, a natural gas company owned by former Ukrainian Environment Minister Mykola Zlochevskiy. The same month, the U.K. opened a money laundering investigation into Zlochevskiy\u2019s business and froze Burisma\u2019s accounts.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2014, Ukrainian prosecutors, then under Prosecutor General Vitaliy Yarema, initiated an illicit enrichment and money laundering investigation into Zlochevskiy. Their actual motivation might have been to help Zlochevskiy unfreeze accounts in the U.K. In any case, they failed to present any evidence of ill-gotten gains to U.K. investigators, who were thus unable to keep the funds frozen.\n\nViktor Shokin, the \u201ctough prosecutor\u201d mentioned in Trump\u2019s tweet, took over as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general on Feb. 10, 2015. From then until his firing on April 3, 2016, he did nothing to advance the case against Zlochevskiy. Although Joe Biden has boasted of getting Shokin ousted, the prosecutor had plenty of enemies, including Ukrainian activists, European governments and some of his own underlings. Also, the dismissal gave then-President Petro Poroshenko the opportunity to replace Shokin with a close ally, Yury Lutsenko.\n\nUnder Lutsenko, the state forced Zlochevskiy to pay some back taxes and closed the Burisma case \u2013 an outcome that Transparency International has portrayed as a sweet deal for Zlochevsky. The investigation was apparently reopened at some point in late 2018 or 2019, but Zlochevskiy wasn\u2019t charged. Lutsenko has said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nBy rights, Ukraine should reinvestigate the Zlochevskiy case to determine whether he got off easy and what roles at least three prosecutors general \u2013 Yarema, Shokin and Lutsenko \u2013 might have played. But it\u2019s hard to see how this would turn up dirt on the Bidens. The alleged money laundering would have occurred before Hunter Biden joined Burisma. Whatever role the senior Biden played in getting Shokin fired, it was tangential to an investigation that appears to have been intentionally slow and ineffective at every stage.\n\nMoreover, Zelenskiy must recognize a fundamental rule for Ukrainian leaders dealing with the U.S.: Never antagonize anyone who might become president.\n\nConsider how Zelenskiy\u2019s predecessor, Poroshenko, handled himself. With the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election uncertain, he had to tread carefully. This of course meant he wouldn\u2019t go after the Bidens. But it also required caution regarding Trump\u2019s people with Ukrainian connections.\n\nUnder Poroshenko, Ukraine never conducted a proper investigation into the Kyiv business of Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, and never charged him despite finding evidence that he\u2019d been paid tax-free to work on Ukrainian political campaigns. Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau revealed that Manafort\u2019s name was next to some payments recorded in the secret books of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, but didn\u2019t look further into those records, saying it didn\u2019t have jurisdiction since Manafort was not a Ukrainian government official.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Not for the first time, Ukraine has found itself at the center of an American political scandal.
