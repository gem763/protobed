Our independence day is \"July Fourth\" or the \"Fourth of July,\" but never \"seven four.\"\n\nIt also defies how we typically talk about disasters - we remember \"Pearl Harbor,\" but not necessarily \"12/7.\" The reasoning for this is pretty clear: The September 11 attacks took place in multiple locations, so it would be difficult to come up with a single term that encompasses the whole thing.\n\nLinguists were quick to pick up on the unusual construction: The American Dialect Society, a group of linguists and language experts, named \"9/11\" its 2001 Word of the Year for its widespread popularity. Interestingly, the term caught on worldwide, even in countries where dates are typically written in the day-month format.\n\nIn the coming years, a handful of other major terrorist incidents got the calendrical treatment, including the 2005 London bombings (\"7/7\") and the 2004 Madrid bombings (\"11-M,\" referring to March 11).\n\nAppropriately, as Adrienne LaFrance wrote for Medium in 2013, referring to the September 11 attacks by their date helps Americans keep their collective promise to \"never forget\" them.\n\n\"Using calendrical shorthand to refer to a disaster seems inherently part of this push to remember, because knowing an event by its date is in itself a means of ensuring commemoration,\" she wrote.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The phrase \"9/11\" caught the attention of linguists and changed the way we talk about terrorist attacks.
