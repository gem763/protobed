This means that, even if unsolicited, users are exposed to whatever twisted image someone chooses to send.\n\nBased on testimonies of arrested AirDrop Chikan, the main purpose is to get a kick out of the person\u2019s reaction upon suddenly seeing a dirty photograph.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s relatively easy to turn off a phone\u2019s ability to accept these requests from unknown devices, but many people don\u2019t seem to fully understand it. This ensures that an AirDrop Chikan\u2019s chances of finding victims in crowded places remains high.\n\nIt had been a growing problem in Japan with no end in sight\u2013that is, until Apple suddenly ended it. In their recent iOS13 update, Apple had stopped the thumbnail image from appearing on AirDrop send requests, greatly damaging an AirDrop Chikan\u2019s ability to harass people.\n\n\u25bc AirDrop sends request on iOS 12.\n\n\u25bc AirDrop sends request on iOS 13.\n\nGranted, the request will still arrive for people who have their settings on \u201cEveryone\u201d but they will have to take the plunge and tap \u201cAccept\u201d before getting exposed to whatever is on the other end.\n\nHowever, that would be like opening emails from the Prince of Nigeria and discount Viagra dealers, in that you are voluntarily entering this shady world and should accept some of the blame for whatever happens as a result.\n\nReaders of the news applauded this simple but effective solution.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a nice change.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat way to stop those chikan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to update right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t recommend updating to iOS13 as it\u2019s still unstable, but this is a good addition.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone should just turn off the \u2018everyone\u2019 setting instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cMakes me wonder why it wasn\u2019t like this from the start.\u201d\n\nThe old thumbnail feature was a nice touch as it lets you know what was coming from who at a glance and also confirms whether it was a photo that you needed or already had.\n\nSource: Twitter/IPA_anshin, My Game News Flash\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japanese man changed name of his iPhone to \u201cPlease send cat pictures\u201d and it worked\n\n-- Samsung, IOC deny asking iPhone carrying Olympic athletes to cover their Apple logos\n\n-- Tokyo proposes new law cracking down on requests for teens to share nude selfies online\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/12/social-plague-of-airdrop-chikan-wiped-out-with-simple-change-in-ios-13-update/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "For the past few months in Japan, the media has been covering a growing social problem of \u201cAirDrop Chikan.\u201d They are a revolutionary breed of chikan who utilize Apple\u2019s AirDrop function to remotely send dirty pictures to any other Apple user within a several-meter radius in busy locations such as trains.
