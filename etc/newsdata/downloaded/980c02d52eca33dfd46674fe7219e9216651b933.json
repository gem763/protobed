He was similarly denied last season when his goal at Old Trafford was given to Luke Shaw.\n\nLionel Messi put Barcelona 1-0 up with just three minutes gone when he side-footed home first time from Arthur's pass\n\nMessi's strike was his 113th Champions League goal, leaving him 14 behind Cristiano Ronaldo's all-time record tally of 127\n\nSlavia Prague levelled when defender Jan Boril scored on 50 minutes but it wasn't long before Barca were back in front\n\nMessi got the first for Barcelona in this 2-1 win. He had never played Slavia Prague before but he took just three minutes to introduce himself properly.\n\nHe won the ball back from Petr Sevcik in midfield, swapped passes with Arthur and with a quick control and shot beat Ondrej Kolar to give Barcelona the early lead.\n\nSlavia Prague\u2019s plan had been to suffocate Barcelona with a high press but they were struggling to get out of their defensive third in the first 20 minutes.\n\nSlavia Prague v Barcelona Slavia Prague: Kolar, Coufal, Kudela, Hovorka, Boril, Soucek, Sevcik, Masopust, Stanciu, Zeleny, Olayinka. Subs: Holes, Husbauer, Tecl, van Buren, Skoda, Frydrych, Kovar. Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Nelson Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Jordi Alba, Arthur, Busquets, de Jong, Messi, Suarez, Griezmann. Subs: Rakitic, Todibo, Dembele, Neto, Vidal, Firpo, Fati. Referee: Robert Madden (Scotland)\n\nWhen they did emerge Barcelona needed Marc Andre Ter Stegen to make three important saves.\n\nHe saved from Jaroslav Zeleny, Lukas Masopust and Olayinka in a shaky ten minutes for Barcelona. They might have put distance between themselves and the Czech champions had Suarez been able to finish. Twice he was presented with first half chances to bring to an end his 1,498 day away day European scoring drought, and twice he couldn\u2019t beat the keeper.\n\nIt seemed to be getting to him late in the half when he put one pass straight out of play. Scottish referee Bobby Madden booked Jordi Alba late in the half for a push on Slavia Prague captain Tomas Soucek. That aside Barcelona were keeping their heads against a team that has already taken points from Inter this season.\n\nBut when the second half started Barcelona didn\u2019t start with it and were punished when on 50 minutes Jan Boril equalized.\n\nThe full-back appeared from nowhere between Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba before firing past Ter Stegen.\n\nParity lasted only eight minutes and when the equalizer came it was Suarez wheeling away to celebrate but it will not count as his goal. Messi\u2019s free-kick fell to him at the far post but he had only been able to turn the ball in from the angle off of the chest of Olayinka.\n\nSlavia Prague responded to the set-back by showing plenty of spirit and substitute Josef Husbauer went close.\n\nBarcelona sent Ousmane Dembele on for Antoine Griezmann and he sprinted clear before teeing up Suarez but the forward shot wide. The Barcelona number nine also sent an angled shot wide of the far post after Messi had played him in.\n\nPeter Olayinka stuck a leg out in a bid to intercept Suarez's shot but could only divert the ball past his own goalkeeper\n\nOlayinka cut a dejected figure after his unfortunate own goal undid Slavia Prague's hard work to get back in the game\n\nSuarez missed a glorious chance to make it 3-1 when he fired wide of goal after being sent through one-on-one\n\nMessi missed from an Alba cross with the goal gaping. The cross seemed to invite a right foot finish but Messi\u2019s left foot hooked the ball wide. It didn\u2019t matter. His early goal and the Suarez-provoked second were enough for Barcelona to win the game and go top of the group.\n\nThe needed brave defensive clearances from Lenglet and substitute Ivan Rakitic throwing themselves in front of shots, to see them over the line, but they took the three precious points.\n\nIf they beat Slavia Prague at the Camp Nou in a fortnight they will be all but qualified for the last-16.", "description": "SLAVIA PRAGUE 1-2 BARCELONA: Lionel Messi scored his 113th Champions League goal as Barcelona beat Slavia Prague to tighten their grip on Group F to move three points clear of Inter Milan.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/23/20106046-0-image-a-17_1571868301671.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
