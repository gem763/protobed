But the president alone cannot tame the regulatory state (especially while threatening to regulate internet platforms).\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nCongress and the judiciary must also pursue reform and refrain from further expanding regulators\u2019 powers. While incremental progress is possible, powerful forces favor the status quo, which makes substantive reform difficult to achieve.\n\nThe nation\u2019s current regulatory burden belies Francis Scott Key\u2019s characterization of America as the \u201cland of the free.\u201d The United States ranked only \u201cmostly free\u201d in the 2019 Heritage Index of Economic Freedom, trailing 11 other nations. (They are Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Iceland.)\n\nBut at least the U.S.\u2019s economic freedom score this year is the highest since 2011\u2014a result, in part, of President Donald Trump\u2019s reform efforts.\n\nThe Trump administration has curtailed the unparalleled regulatory expansion of the Obama years, during which the regulatory burden increased by $122 billion annually, according to analyses by the Heritage Foundation. That increase was nearly double the $68 billion in annual regulatory costs imposed on the private-sector during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nTo date, the Trump administration has issued 55% fewer regulations than his two predecessors had prescribed at the same point in their administrations. During Trump\u2019s first 32 months in office, only 121 \u201cmajor\u201d regulations (i.e., rules that are anticipated to impose costs in excess of $100 million annually) have been issued, compared to 223 under Obama and 133 under Bush.\n\nSlowing the output of new rules is essential, to be sure, but the federal stockpile of regulations\u2014exceeding 185,000 pages of the U.S. Code\u2014continues to impede investment, innovation and job creation. According to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the private-sector paperwork burden now totals 11.2 billion hours annually at a cost of $139.5 billion.\n\nRegulatory proponents exploit every means available to stymie efforts to repeal even the most egregious rules, including the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan ($7.2 billion annually); the Obamacare personal mandate; and excessive automotive fuel efficiency standards.\n\nUltimately, however, the federal regulatory system is so difficult to reform because it is a political spoils system \u2014 one by which various special interests impose their will on the public and profit from government favor.\n\nRegulatory repeal by a president is a cumbersome process involving years of administrative wrangling, including a statement of rationale, analyses of rulemaking alternatives and solicitation of public comment.\n\nThere are also constitutional limits on the president\u2019s powers to reform the regulatory process. For example, the White House cannot countermand regulatory directives from Congress, nor can it restrain Congress from delegating legislative authority to federal agencies. And while the president does influence the judiciary through his nominations to the federal bench, he cannot stop the courts from continuing to grant inordinate discretion to regulators.\n\nUltimately, however, the federal regulatory system is so difficult to reform because it is a political spoils system \u2014 one by which various special interests impose their will on the public and profit from government favor.\n\nExcessive regulation and the regulatory state\n\nIn contrast to the president\u2019s commitment to reform, his apparent sympathy for internet regulation is deeply troubling. Facebook, Google, and other dominant platforms do wield enormous influence, but they are not public properties and should not be treated as such. Ill-conceived regulation would actually secure their market dominance rather than erode it (which is part of the reason Silicon Valley titans have embraced government interference).\n\nCompared to regulatory beneficiaries, low-income families and fixed-income seniors are hardest hit by unfettered rulemaking; higher prices driven by regulatory costs consume a larger proportion of their assets. Moreover, the excessive spending on fashionable causes and hypothetical threats (e.g., global warming) consume resources that could be better spent remedying the actual environmental risks in low-income communities, such as contaminated drinking water and toxic soils.\n\nAll three branches of government share the blame for excessive regulation, and action by all three is necessary to achieve meaningful reform. Unless constrained, the regulatory state will overwhelm America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and diminish the freedoms upon which this nation was founded and by which it has prospered.\n\nDiane Katz is a senior research fellow specializing in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies.", "description": "The nation\u2019s current regulatory burden belies\u00a0Francis\u00a0Scott Key\u2019s characterization of America as the 'land of the free.'", "authors": ["Diane Katz"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201910/3577/0/0/854081161001_6093435212001_6093436362001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
