Wayne Johnson, the Department of Education\u2019s Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.\u201d\n\nOutstanding student debt stands at $1.48 trillion as of the last quarter, according to the New York Fed. Borrowers in the current system are facing loan burdens that are souring quickly: Out of the outstanding severely derogatory balance, 35% are defaulted student loans. Those in public service who applied for Public Service Loan Forgiveness are seeing 99% rejection rates.\n\nJohnson called for federal student loan debt up to $50,000 be forgiven on an individual basis and tax credits provided up to $50,000 for debt already paid. He said the idea developed after joining the administration and discovering the difficulties borrowers were facing with their student loans. The plan would cost an estimated $925 billion, according to Johnson.\n\n(Source: Liberty Street Economics) More\n\nStudent loan plan at odds with the Trump administration\n\nJohnson\u2019s position on cancelling student debt is similar to student loan forgiveness plans announced by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2014 while sharply at odds with the Trump administration, the Republican party, and specifically his own boss.\n\n\"Their proposals are crazy,\" DeVos said during an interview on Fox News, referring to Democrats\u2019 proposals on student loan cancellation.\n\n\"Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It's going to be two of the three Americans that aren't going to college paying for the one out of three that do \u2026 Let's look at this for what it really is: A federal takeover of higher education.\"\n\nBetsy DeVos, U.S. secretary of education, listens during a roundtable discussion with U.S. President Donald Trump on the Federal Commission on School Safety report in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018.

He has also been with VISA, Deloitte, among others.\n\nThe Macon, Georgia native now has a bigger goal in sight. He announced his plan to run for the U.S. Senate seat in his state that was recently made vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA).\n\n\u201cI intend to follow Senator Isakson\u2019s example as a conservative Republican who is able to work across the aisle in Congress,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u2014\n\nAarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
