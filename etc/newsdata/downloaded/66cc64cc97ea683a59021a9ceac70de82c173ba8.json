But Huberdeau tied it at 4:28 of the second period when he stole the puck in the neutral zone and buried a shot from the wing on the ensuing rush.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Leon Draisaitl scored twice, including the winner at 1:18 of overtime, as the Edmonton Oilers rallied to defeat the visiting Washington Capitals 4-3 Thursday night in a matchup of division leaders.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444753193&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O09I-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
