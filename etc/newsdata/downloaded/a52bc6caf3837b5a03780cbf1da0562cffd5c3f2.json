It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this conference: it is an outcome for which we are ready.\u201d\n\nNo Delay\n\nThe U.K. is due to exit the EU on Oct. 31 and Johnson says he will never agree to delaying Brexit beyond that date, even if it means leaving without an agreement -- risking disruption at ports, to business supply chains, and to the security of food, fuel and water supplies.\n\nThe next few days will be crucial. If Johnson fails to get a deal, he faces a showdown with Parliament and a battle in court over his plan to take Britain out of the bloc with no deal. It could ultimately be up to the judges to decide if Johnson can make good on his threat.\n\nIn his speech, Johnson insisted he loves Europe and wants a strong relationship with the bloc in future. But in an interview with The Sun newspaper he set EU negotiators an Oct. 11 deadline for agreeing a headline deal with the U.K..\n\nHe gave few details of his blueprint to resolve the toxic question of avoiding the need for checkpoints to inspect goods crossing the Irish border, which has held up progress in the negotiations for the past year.\n\nHe said his plan is a \u201ccompromise.\u201d It involves a common set of rules for agriculture across the island of Ireland, no customs checks on goods crossing the Irish border \u201cat or near\u201d that frontier, and a \u201crenewable\u201d process in which the Northern Ireland elected assembly gives its consent to the system in operation.\n\nSkeptical\n\nThere are few signs that European leaders are willing to accept Johnson\u2019s proposals. Ireland, a key voice on the EU side, has already rejected elements of the plan.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, before the prime minister\u2019s speech, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals did not appear encouraging. \u201cEssentially, if he\u2019s proposing customs checks on the island of Ireland then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the basis of an agreement,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nGiving their initial reaction, European officials in Brussels said they would not be backing down. They said they would consider working for a compromise, but only if Johnson\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t threaten the peace and economy of the island of Ireland or blow holes in the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nWhile they haven\u2019t seen full details of the plan, EU officials are skeptical, saying it appears unworkable in its current form, primarily because it separates single market regulations from customs rules.\n\nFinal Offer?\n\nIf Johnson intends it to be a take-it-or-leave-it offer rather than the basis for the start of a negotiation that sees the U.K. move much closer to the EU position, the bloc will start working on the terms of another Brexit delay and continue planning for the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, one official said.\n\nDavid Frost, the prime minister\u2019s EU envoy, will arrive at the European Commission mid-afternoon with copies of the plan for Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and his team.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is then expected to speak to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Johnson by phone later on Wednesday. After a few hours of scrutiny, EU officials will brief and discuss the U.K. plan with diplomats from the EU\u2019s 27 remaining countries.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.\u00a0Boris Johnson outlined his plan for a new Brexit agreement, and warned the European Union to compromise or watch the U.K. walk away from talks and leave the bloc without a deal.The U.K. prime minister declared that Britain is \u201cready\u201d to", "authors": ["Tim Ross", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IpJu.AE4sh7mN11owgCS4g--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/bloomberg_politics_video_969/bb0e91e39ba3292c1c092e47fa21cbda"}
