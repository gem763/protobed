He said he thought Pence and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would have a successful meeting, but warned of sanctions and tariffs that \u201cwill be devastating to Turkey\u2019s economy\u201d otherwise.\n\nThe White House released a letter from Trump to Erdogan from Oct. 9 that said: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Turkish broadcaster CNN Turk said Turkey had rejected Trump\u2019s appeal to reach a deal to avoid conflict and the letter was \u201cthrown in the trash\u201d.\n\nA Turkish official told Reuters: \u201cThe letter Trump sent did not have the impact he expected in Turkey because it had nothing to take seriously.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that Turkey does not want a terrorist organization on its border and the operation will not stop because of the reaction that has been coming.\u201d\n\nPence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not speak to reporters before the start of the meeting with Erdogan, but the official said they were likely to convey the same U.S. demands, adding: \u201cHowever, negotiating with a terrorist organization or turning back from the ongoing operation are not on the agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that the United States was prepared to levy additional sanctions on if necessary \u201cto keep Turkey in line\u201d.\n\nA top aide to Erdogan, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry was preparing to retaliate for the sanctions by its NATO ally.\n\nUNTIL GOALS MET\n\nErdogan has dismissed the sanctions and rejected a global chorus of calls to halt the offensive, which Turkey says will create a \u201csafe zone\u201d extending 20 miles (32 km) into northeast Syria to ensure the return of millions of Syrian refugees and clear the area of Kurdish militia Ankara views as terrorists.\n\nTurkey will end its operation when Kurdish forces withdraw from the \u201csafe zone\u201d and \u201cno power\u201d can deter the operation until it reaches its goals, the Turkish leader said.\n\nTrump has defended his move to withdraw troops from Syria as part of a wider effort to bring U.S. soldiers home from \u201cendless wars\u201d, despite criticism by members of his own Republican Party.\n\nTurkey\u2019s operation has allowed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to send his Russian-backed forces to an area that had been beyond his control for years in the more than eight-year-old Syrian war.\n\nIt also prompted the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the Kurdish YPG is the main component, to strike a deal with Damascus for its help in countering Turkish forces.\n\nRussia has promised Turkey that the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia targeted by the offensive will not be in the Syrian territories across the border, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the BBC on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman said Syria should get control over its border with Turkey as part of any settlement of the conflict in the region.\n\nAssad vowed that Syria would respond to the Turkish offensive on any part of its territory with \u201call legitimate means\u201d available, Syrian state media said on Thursday.\n\nAnkara views the U.S.-backed YPG as a terrorist organization because of its link to Kurdish militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, and had been infuriated by Washington\u2019s support.\n\nA Reuters cameraman along the Turkish border with Syria said clashes continued around the border town of Ras al Ain on Thursday and that Turkish warplanes were flying overhead after a lull in fighting overnight.\n\nAnkara had previously said it has taken control of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, two key towns along the frontier.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrives at Esenboga International Airport in Ankara, Turkey, October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir\n\nThe region\u2019s Kurdish-led authority called for a corridor \u201cto evacuate dead and wounded civilians\u201d from Ras al-Ain. It said people were trapped in the town, urging foreign powers including the U.S.-led coalition and Russia, to intervene to get them out.\n\nSyrian troops accompanied by Russian forces have meanwhile entered Kobani, a strategic border city and potential flashpoint for a wider conflict, said the British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nLebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support.\n\nHezbollah\u2019s al-Manar TV said from the Tabqa military air base near Raqqa that Syrian government troops had advanced in that area.\n\n\u201cWe entered the Tabqa military airport easily, there was no difficulty,\u201d an army officer told the channel from the base, where Islamic State fighters executed scores of Syrian troops and circulated a video of their corpses in 2014.\n\nSoldiers entered Tabqa and nearby villages on Monday, state media said, a deployment that restored the state\u2019s foothold in that part of Syria for the first time in years.\n\nWith U.S. air power and special forces, the SDF had battled for weeks in 2017 to take Tabqa and a nearby hydroelectric dam - the country\u2019s largest dam - from Islamic State.\n\nCIVILIAN CASUALTIES\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in the region said the\n\nTurkish offensive had killed 218 civilians, including 18 children since it started a week ago. The fighting has also wounded more than 650 people, it said.\n\nTurkish authorities say 20 people have been killed in Turkey by bombardment from Syria, including eight people who were killed in a mortar attack on the town of Nusaybin by YPG militants on Friday, according to the local governor\u2019s office.\n\nIn Geneva, humanitarian agencies said they were struggling to meet the needs of up to 200,000 civilians who had fled the fighting and reported water shortages in the Syrian city of Hasaka.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe operation has also created a land-rush between Turkey and Russia - now the undisputed foreign powers in the area - to partition Kurdish areas that were formerly under U.S protection.\n\nRussia, Assad\u2019s most powerful ally, has called the offensive \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said it must be limited in time and scale.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met President Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey on Thursday on a mission to persuade him to halt an offensive against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, but Turkish officials said the action would continue regardless.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441859026&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G11U", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
