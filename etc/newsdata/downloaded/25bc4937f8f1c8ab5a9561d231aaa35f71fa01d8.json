Now it's getting a pretty significant discount. You can get the 2018 MacBook Air for $200 off its normal price straight from Amazon.\n\nThere are a ton of things to love about the most recent iteration of the MacBook Air. Notably, the device offers a super-classy design. It has a 13-inch display, and is only 0.61 inches thick at its thickest. It's also only 2.75 pounds \u2014 so in general the laptop is more than sleek and thin enough to take on the road. The MacBook Air is available in a few different colors too \u2014 including Gold, Silver, and Space Gray.\n\nOf course, it's perhaps what's under the hood that's a little more important. In the MacBook Air, you'll get an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, though you can upgrade the device to offer 256GB of storage if you so choose.\n\nThere are other features to note too. Around the edges of the device, you'll get two Lightning ports and a headphone jack, which isn't bad. There's also a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built right into the keyboard of the device, so you can quickly and easily authenticate your identity without having to type in a password.
