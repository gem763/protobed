As predictable as this has been, there have been some lessons learnt about the team along the way, with a quarterfinal against either Ireland, Japan or Scotland looming next Sunday.\n\nHere is what we\u2019ve learnt from the Springboks\u2019 exploits in Japan:\n\nIt ain\u2019t over until Bongi Mbonambi says so\n\nWhen the Springboks left for Japan, Malcolm Marx, anointed the best hooker in the world in certain pockets in the country, was understood to be the starting hooker for the Boks. Mbonambi, whose calling card has always been hard work, bided his time and basically pursued that starting spot to the ends of the earth, which was Japan in this case.\n\nHe may not have Marx\u2019s size, bulk or explosiveness \u2013 qualities that strangely become becalmed when the Lions hooker starts missing with his line-out throws \u2013 but Mbonambi more than makes up for that by nailing all his line-out throws, doing his work in the scrums and making a general nuisance of himself thanks to his indefatigability.\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus has recognised this, and Mbonambi was sat in cotton wool for the quarterfinals when the Boks played their last group game against Canada.\n\nRead: \u2018Scoring tries brings adrenaline\u2019 - Herschel Jantjies\n\nErasmus and J\u00fcrgen Klopp have never been seen together\n\nA bit like Jake White with the whole fetcher debate all those years ago, Liverpool coach Klopp surprised all and sundry a few years ago when he said the media was the greatest playmaker he knew.\n\nOn the face of it, the only similarity between Klopp and Erasmus is that they\u2019re ever-smiling, but looking at the latter\u2019s defensive approach \u2013 a rush defence aimed at harassing the ball-carrier into a mistake the Boks can pounce on \u2013 the two have similar beliefs when it comes to the creative qualities of defence. With regular playmakers Handr\u00e9 Pollard and Willie le Roux struggling, to borrow from a colleague, to put team-mates away \u201clike Gerrie Nel does\u201d, the defence has come in handy as an extra creator.\n\nThe Boks have dancing feet, if they want ...\n\nThat said, the Boks have no shortage of players who can create that proverbial something out of nothing for themselves thanks to their dancing feet.\n\nWinger Cheslin Kolbe has made this abundantly clear by being the menace-in-chief to defences in the tournament, while Warrick Gelant and the newly arrived Damian Willemse have shown flashes of having similar intentions when they have played.\n\nBut the Boks appear to have no inclination to engage in that kind of game, especially with the knockout stages looming.\n\nThe Bok pack\u2019s brutality is a thing of ugly beauty\n\nBeast Mtawarira is back to his, ahem, beastly best, whispering sweet nothings to his opponents as he grinds them into the turf at scrum time. Lood de Jager is restored to his rightly place in the starting line-up (when fit and on form, he\u2019s South Africa\u2019s best lock). Pieter-Steph du Toit just keeps on trucking.\n\nSiya Kolisi is fully fit and Duane Vermeulen is regaining the physical edge that made him \u201cThor\u201d. And with Bomb Squad members Steven \u201cSpicy Plum\u201d Kitshoff, the brooding Marx, Vincent \u201cMr Incredible\u201d Koch and the offloading Bakkies Botha that is RG Snyman, it\u2019s tough not to recognise South Africa\u2019s as possibly the best pack at this World Cup.\n\nSchalk Brits is having the time of his life\n\nTaken to Japan as the head cheerleader, Brits hasn\u2019t disappointed and he\u2019s absolutely everyone\u2019s favourite. Already a popular figure in the Bok team, the 38-year-old has been a firm favourite with the ball boys and girls (because he bows to them when they give him the ball), a constant joking companion with the referees (probably because he\u2019s the same age as them), and presents a friendly face not altogether associated with a typical Bok team (we do insularity a little too well, sometimes). Simply put, the diminutive hooker has charmed the pants off everyone.\n\nSomebody remarked that, after hanging up his boots for the second time, he should think about diplomacy as his next calling.", "description": "By finishing second behind defending champions New Zealand in Pool B at the Rugby World Cup, the Springboks have done pretty much what was expected the day the draw was made a few years ago.
