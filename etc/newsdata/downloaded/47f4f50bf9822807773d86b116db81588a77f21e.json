After years of disappointment, Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing, for the right reason, at the right time. He has not fallen, we\u2019re led to believe, for what Tony Blair accurately called Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201celephant trap\u201d of an early election. He has, according to the briefings, decided to put killing off no-deal first, and an election second.\n\nThis is very much a principled move, in the national interest and (for a change) it is a Labour parliamentary manoeuvre that will succeed.\n\nAs it happens, with a persistent 10-point opinion poll deficit against the Tories, dodging a general election is also very much in his party\u2019s interests \u2013 socialism is not about kamikaze politics, surely \u2013 it is about the interests of the people Labour seeks to protect.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf we want Brexit plus five years of radical free market government by Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, then the best way to secure it \u2013 as the gangsters in Downing Street well know \u2013 is to accommodate what Corbyn rightly calls a \u201csmash-and-grab\u201d raid on the constitution now. The NHS, schools and local council services will be at their mercy; it would be the 1980s, or the 1930s, all over again \u2013 but worse. Not a good legacy for the Corbyn-McDonnell era.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That\u2019s easy to answer: more deadlock.\n\nA proud man, despite his charming self-deprecation, Johnson is not going to obey the will of parliament and ask for an Article 50 extension or dilute his \u201cdo or die\u201d mission in any way. He will whinge, and drag his feet, and pull faces, and mutter like a naughty Eton schoolboy being sent to the House Master\u2019s study for some disciplinary action. He\u2019d rather abscond than go and talk to Tusk.\n\nSo parliament has legislated for something that the prime minister physically cannot bring himself to do, and the impasse drags on. Maybe Europe might not offer a way out, and not an extension \u2013 except that they have said they would do so if we can find a democratic way of going ahead, and Angela Merkel has endless patience.\n\nA general election \u2013 at any time \u2013 would be risky for either party, and most likely give us another confused and hung parliament, possibly this time round with Nigel Farage and a handful of Brexit Party troublemakers getting a foothold in the Commons. It wouldn\u2019t solve the European question or much else.\n\nLike Sherlock Holmes solving a crime, when all the obvious solutions are dispensed with there leaves only the once improbable: a Final Say referendum.\n\nIt is matter of logic. We will, sooner or later, have to put the question, now in its starkest binary form again, back to the people in a second referendum: No Deal or No Brexit? Leave or Remain?\n\nThis time it should be binding, by legislation, and no one can disagree with the result, on either side. And then the Brexit crisis, one way or another, will be over.\n\nMaybe.", "description": "At last.
