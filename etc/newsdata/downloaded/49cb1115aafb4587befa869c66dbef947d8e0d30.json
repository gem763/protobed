Photograph: Natalia Jidovanu\n\nMeeting the sustainable development goals (SDGs) \u2013 a global call to action to eradicate poverty, protect the Earth and promote peace and prosperity \u2013 will not only require all hands on deck, but all tech on deck as well. The internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are already playing a key role in tackling today\u2019s immense environmental and social challenges, and adopting these technologies more broadly could help scale solutions in a way that once might have seemed impossible. Among the potential key players are three disruptive social enterprises, who spoke at the Business Call to Action\u2019s recent annual forum in New York.\n\nSevamob\n\nSevamob is an Indian social enterprise that provides primary healthcare services at more than 100 locations in India, South Africa and Georgia, US. With its \u201cpop-up\u201d clinics, Sevamob could potentially reach millions of poor people in rural and other under-served communities. But what really sets it apart is its use of AI to detect various medical conditions \u2013 from vitamin deficiencies and minor skin infections, such as thrush, to serious diseases, such as glaucoma and malaria \u2013 on the spot.\n\nThis is a big deal in under-served areas, where people often can\u2019t find, let alone afford, specialist doctors, such as ophthalmologists and dermatologists, and where sending samples to distant labs can increase costs and delay treatment.\n\nWhat Sevamob\u2019s tech does is use machine learning \u2013 a branch of AI that improves and \u201clearns\u201d as data is inputted \u2013 to assess urgency of symptoms, detect patterns, and count objects, from vision, skin and blood (and soon urine) screenings. For instance, with a blood sample, a nurse using a microscope and a smartphone app can immediately diagnose anemia and malaria. The company\u2019s model has the potential to detect more than 50 different medical conditions from blood alone, says Shelley Saxena, founder and CEO.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve developed is an underlying platform, to which any number of medical conditions can be added in the future,\u201d Saxena said. \u201cAll we need to expand the platform is to get more patient data and build the model for that data.\u201d\n\nFrom tranquil kingdom to busy exporter: will Bhutan find prosperity in hazelnuts?

Those of us who don\u2019t rely on farming for our livelihood see these changes most clearly in the increasing number of extreme weather events. But an extreme event for a smallholder might be something barely noticeable outside of farming, such as nightly temperatures inching up just enough to enable insects or diseases to thrive, says John Corbett, CEO and co-founder of aWhere. These small atmospheric changes can be all that\u2019s needed to destroy a crop.\n\nSo aWhere provides farmers with information, such as ultra-accurate weather forecasts, that help them navigate an unpredictable climate.\n\nHowever, unlike Sevamob, aWhere\u2019s business model isn\u2019t limited to serving farmers at the base of the economic pyramid. This global company is no small startup \u2013 its clients include commercial growers, commodity traders and policymakers. This broad range of clients has allowed aWhere to stay in business and grow while maintaining its mission.\n\nEnvirofit International\n\nTo reach customers at the base of the pyramid, energy company Envirofit uses IoT technology that allows its customers to purchase cooking gas the way they make all of their purchases: in small quantities.\n\nEnvirofit designs and develops cleaner-energy solutions for families still reliant on burning wood or charcoal. Its latest innovation is SmartGas, pay-as-you-go cooking that enables customers to pay as little as 50 cents at a time.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the way consumers in emerging markets purchase things, it\u2019s in small daily amounts,\u201d says Jessica Alderman, the company\u2019s director of communications. \u201cNo one buys the big tub of shampoo; they buy the single-serving packets.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the technology, it\u2019s the service model that comes with it, Alderman says. Envirofit installs a smart meter in the customer\u2019s house and delivers that first cylinder of gas. During that process, the company\u2019s representatives teach the customers how to safely use the system. The customer uses an app on their phone to add credit when they need it, and the meter dispenses the gas until the credit runs out. The meter then shuts off the system until payment is made again \u2013 but before the tank runs out, the customer gets a warning, so they can order a new tank.\n\n\u201cFor the customer, [our smart technology] has a huge impact, because it improves safety, access and affordability,\u201d said Alderman. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the customer, this is revolutionary tech for investors who want to know where dollars go, too.\u201d\n\nBecause the smart meter and phone app track gas usage, this technology makes it possible to easily measure \u2013 without proactive house-by-house polling \u2013 the adoption of gas cooking, for the first time in the industry, Alderman says.\n\nMeasuring impact has become increasingly important among impact investors \u2013 those interested in social and environmental benefits, as well as financial returns. So providing a tool for measurement, and therefore encouraging investment, is just one more way advanced technologies can accelerate the race to meet the SDGs.", "description": "Tech-savvy entrepreneurs may hold the key to reaching some of the 17 sustainable development goals.
