Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address \u201cenvironmental injustice\u201d and \u201cenvironmental racism,\u201d which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by \u201cindustrial pollution.\u201d\n\nWarren argues that \u201cjustice\u201d plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people:\n\nA more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water \u2013 including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off.\n\nWarren calls this phenomenon \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d and concludes that \u201cenvironmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.\u201d\n\nShe previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\n\u201cWe need a government that\u2019s on the side of families\u2014not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,\u201d Warren tweeted alongside the clip:\n\nWe need a government that's on the side of families\u2014not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution. pic.twitter.com/LsXlZQza7r \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019\n\nLike Warren\u2019s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the \u201cneighborhood of their choice.\u201d\n\nShe also pledges to invest one-third \u2013 or $1 trillion \u2013 of her climate change investment \u201cinto the most vulnerable communities,\u201d although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically.\n\nLike most of Warren\u2019s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the \u201cSuperfund Waste Tax.\u201d\n\nHer plan states:\n\nThere are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called \u201corphan\u201d toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u2013 not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u2019ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess.\n\nThe presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will \u201cmake it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.\u201d\n\nWarren also reiterates her pledge to \u201censure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I\u2019ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,\u201d she said. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.\u201d\n\nHowever, Warren\u2019s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel \u2013 which helped the company\u2019s \u201cfight against a congressional requirement that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners\u2019 health care\u201d \u2013 calls her promise into question.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled this country, I\u2019ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\n\u201cThese communities need justice\u2014and I will stand with them,\u201d she added:\n\nIndustrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism\u2014and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019\n\nAs we work to enact the #GreenNewDeal, I'll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need. They've been doing this work for decades\u2014we should listen. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019\n\nBut we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We'll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I'll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they've earned. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019", "description": "Sen.
