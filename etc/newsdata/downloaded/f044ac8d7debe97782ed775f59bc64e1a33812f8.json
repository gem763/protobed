Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda has said the bank would thoroughly examine economic conditions at the next meeting and take additional measures \"without hesitation\", if necessary.\n\nTuesday's results showed Japanese companies weren't very confident about the outlook. Large manufacturers expect the headline index to drop to two in the next three months, while non-manufacturers forecast it would deteriorate to 15 from 21 in the September survey, reflecting caution against the impact of the national sales tax increase to 10% from 8%, which went into effect Tuesday.\n\nLarge companies also grew cautious about their investment plans. They plan to increase their capital investment in the current fiscal year ending in March 2020 by 6.6%, compared with an increase of 7.4% projected three months ago.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "TOKYO--Sentiment among Japan's large manufacturers deteriorated to the weakest level in more than six years in the three months to September amid growing...", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
