But Japan refused to grant the United States access to the TPP-wide quotas in the bilateral deal. European Union brands gained similar access in a Japan-EU trade deal launched in February.\n\nBut there are gains that bring U.S. beef, pork and wine exports in line with TPP competitors from Australia, New Zealand and Canada, putting them on the same tariff schedule.\n\n\"There are some specific parts of the ag sector that really do benefit from this,\" said Matthew Goodman, an Asian economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"More broadly, this is not a highly significant deal from a commercial perspective, as it doesn't touch the biggest item in bilateral trade, autos and auto parts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S LEFT OUT\n\nThe U.S.-Japan agriculture-centered deal is notable for what it leaves out. It does not include the bulk of products that make up the bilateral trading relationship, notably autos from Japan and aircraft, liquefied propane gas and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the United States.\n\n(See graphic on top U.S. exports to Japan https://tmsnrt.rs/2mnCbY9)\n\nMotor vehicles and parts, by far the largest Japanese export to the United States at $56 billion in 2018, were left out for a later phase of negotiations. Abe said Trump agreed not to impose threatened \"Section 232\" tariffs on Japanese cars and parts on national security grounds.\n\nJapan has no tariffs on cars and trucks from the United States, but U.S. automakers argue that most American cars are kept out by environmental and safety regulations, and Japan's currency policies that keep the yen low against the dollar.\n\nTPP would have eased Japan's regulatory barriers, but neither agreement contained any rules to combat currency manipulation - a stated goal of the U.S. Trade Representative's office. The United States would have eliminated its 2.5% tariff on cars made in Japan under TPP but it remains in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nLESS THAN TPP\n\nAmerica's rice growers won't benefit from the new bilateral trade deal, as tariffs and quotas on U.S. rice imported to Japan set in the early 1990s remain in place.\n\nUnder the TPP, Japan would have accepted 70,000 metric tons of American rice per year tariff-free under a U.S.-specific quota, but this was not included in the bilateral deal.\n\nTim Johnson, president and CEO of the California Rice Commission, said he hoped for a better deal in later phases of U.S.-Japan talks.\n\nBarley will see improved access to Japan, restoring U.S-specific quotas and a 45% reduction in Japan's mark-up on imports the grain widely used in beer brewing, matching TPP competitors.\n\nBut the deal does not provide the United States access to Japan's TPP-wide quota that grows to 65,000 tons annually over nine years.\n\nSIMILAR TO TPP\n\nUnlike butter and skim milk powder, cheese -- the largest U.S. dairy export to Japan -- will see elimination of Japan's tariffs of up to 40% over 15 years, as it would have done under TPP.\n\nU.S. beef and pork are the major winners in the U.S.-Japan deal. Beef will see Japanese tariffs falling from 38.5 percent currently to 9% by 2033, on the same schedule as TPP competitors Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Pork will see Japanese tariffs eliminated on muscle cuts over 9 years and the 20% tariff on ground seasoned pork eliminated in the deal's fifth year. Japan will eliminate its 10 percent duty on imports of certain U.S. ethanol in 10 years, affecting about $11 million worth of imports, according to a USTR fact sheet. The deal maintains Japan's zero duty on U.S. corn for animal feed but grants a quota eliminating a 3% duty on sweet corn and other types of corn, the USTR said.", "description": "Butter is one of several U.S. dairy products that will not get improved access to Japan's 127 million consumers under the limited bilateral trade deal signed by Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sept. 25.
