Turkey agreed to the five-day pause to let the Kurdish-led SDF militia withdraw from a \"safe zone\" Ankara had sought to capture.\n\nThe deal was praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it would save \"millions of lives,\" while Turkey cast it as a complete victory.\n\nIf implemented, the deal would achieve all the main objectives Turkey announced when it launched its assault on Oct. 9: control of a strip of Syria more than 30 kilometres deep, with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 once U.S. allies in the years long fight against Islamic State \u2014 obliged to pull out.\n\nRepublican and Democratic senators accused Trump of having betrayed the Kurdish allies who were vital in fighting Islamic State militants, of brushing aside the humanitarian costs of Turkey's invasion and of being outwitted by Ankara.\n\nIt was unclear what if any damage came from the shelling heard on Friday.\n\nIt was also unclear whether the SDF would fully comply with the agreement, which would leave Turkish forces in charge of a swath of territory that the Kurds once held with U.S. military support.", "description": "Shelling and gunfire resounded around the northeast Syrian town of Ras al Ain on Friday, a day after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive in Syria for five days to let Kurdish forces withdraw.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5325653.1571386031!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1176485867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
