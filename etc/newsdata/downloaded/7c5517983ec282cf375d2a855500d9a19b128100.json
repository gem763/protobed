Follow along for live updates.\n\nSteelers at Patriots\n\nWhen: Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhere: Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nLine: New England by 5\u00bd\n\nTV: NBC.\n\n[The Steelers are less talented than a year ago. Their GM isn\u2019t worried.]\n\nPregame reading\n\nAntonio Brown won\u2019t be on the field Sunday night in Foxborough, Mass., when the New England Patriots begin their defense of their latest Super Bowl triumph by facing the Pittsburgh Steelers. But his presence certainly will be felt.\n\nThe Steelers will be playing their first game without Brown, the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver they traded to the Oakland Raiders in the offseason, and running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, the running back they allowed to leave via free agency for the New York Jets in March. The Patriots will be playing, quite possibly, their last game without Brown, whom they signed to a one-year contract Saturday after the Raiders accommodated his social-media request to be released.\n\nBrown isn\u2019t eligible to play for the Patriots against the Steelers because he wasn\u2019t on New England\u2019s roster by Saturday\u2019s 4 p.m. NFL deadline. It\u2019s doubtful that Coach Bill Belichick would have rushed him into game action that quickly, anyway. So the question of whether Brown can co-exist with Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in New England better than he could manage with Coach Mike Tomlin and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh or with Coach Jon Gruden and quarterback Derek Carr (not to mention General Manager Mike Mayock) in Oakland won\u2019t be answered until this coming week, at the soonest.\n\n[Now he\u2019s a Patriot: The Antonio Brown saga, explained]\n\nHe\u2019ll be eligible to play for the Patriots next Sunday at Miami. At that point, the Patriots can team Brown with Josh Gordon and Julian Edelman to give Brady perhaps the best group of wide receivers he\u2019s ever had. That, of course, is contingent upon the recently reinstated Gordon remaining available to play and the controversial Brown being content and behaving himself.\n\nFor now, Brady and the Patriots will have to get by without Brown. Gordon is eligible to play in this game. Brady and the Patriots also will begin life without Rob Gronkowski after the tight end retired in March.\n\nThe Steelers accommodated Brown\u2019s trade request after he became increasingly disgruntled in Pittsburgh, in part because of a clash with Roethlisberger. They sent him to Oakland for third- and fifth-round draft picks and undoubtedly felt vindicated and perhaps relieved while watching from afar as Brown\u2019s relationship with the Raiders came unglued before he ever played a regular season game for them.\n\nJames Conner keeps the No. 1 running back role that he inherited when Bell sat out the entire 2018 season in a contract stare-down with the Steelers. JuJu Smith-Schuster takes over for Brown as the No. 1 wideout. The issue becomes whether the supporting cast around Roethlisberger, Conner and Smith-Schuster is good enough for the Steelers to vie with the Cleveland Browns, the darlings of the offseason, and the Baltimore Ravens for AFC North supremacy.\n\nThis is a matchup that generally has big-picture implications for the jockeying for AFC playoff seeding. This time, it\u2019s far too early in the season to think about that. But there still will be plenty of intrigue at Gillette Stadium.\n\nRead more:\n\nAntonio Brown and the Patriots are a match so crazy it just might work\n\nNFL players increasingly want to use their leverage, and realize how little they have\n\nHow Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL\u2019s most anticipated QB\n\nCowboys didn\u2019t play hardball with Ezekiel Elliott.
