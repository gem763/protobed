As the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the greenback, the city essentially imports U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe move probably won\u2019t immediately feed into the cost of credit for businesses and households. HKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan said local banks don\u2019t necessarily need to follow the Fed in a rate cut, because they have their own funding considerations. HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of East Asia Ltd. are among lenders that have recently raised rates for mortgage loans.\n\nMonths of large-scale protests have unnerved investors and consumers and raised the prospect of capital flight. A range of indicators weakened sharply in July and August, signaling the risk that the city will tip into recession. Fitch Ratings Inc. this month downgraded the territory as an issuer of long-term foreign currency debt for the first time since 1995.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s cut may not have a direct impact on Hong Kong as Hong Kong dollar interest rates have been lagging U.S. dollar interest rates, HKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan said at a briefing, adding that short-term rate movements would be more affected by changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding. Chan said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the government sees the economy shrinking in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cHong Kong banks are unlikely to follow any Fed cut now, as they\u2019re under certain funding pressure,\u201d said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. There could be window-dressing activities at banks toward the end of the quarter, and Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd.\u2019s upcoming initial public offering would mop up liquidity, Li said.\n\n\u201cBanks also have to prepare funding for the rest of the year and get themselves ready for the competition with virtual banks. Therefore, their funding pressure will be unlikely to ease up soon,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with comments from HKMA\u2019s Norman Chan in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Yinan Zhao in Beijing at yzhao300@bloomberg.net;Alfred Liu in Hong Kong at aliu226@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Dominic Lau\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut its benchmark interest rate in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve, a mechanical outcome of the city\u2019s currency peg that\u2019s unlikely to be immediately passed on to the suffering economy.The HKMA on Thursday lowered its base rate to 2.25% from 2.5%, hours", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cW.38DrUUnll5w9gWexfbQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/494430c212b05422740fe6561cfd26ca", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
