REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File Photo\n\nThe scandal, affecting two departments at the heart of the Vatican, was the first after several years of relative calm in which reforms enacted by Pope Francis appeared to be taking root.\n\nA Vatican spokesman said he had no immediate comment on the report.\n\nOn its website, L\u2019Espresso published a picture of a police notice to guards at Vatican gates telling them not to allow in the five employees because they had been suspended. The notice included photographs of the five, one of whom is a woman.\n\nThe people whose pictures were on the notice included Tommaso Di Ruzza, the director of the AIF, and Monsignor Mauro Carlino, the head of documentation at the Secretariat of State. The other three held minor roles in the Secretariat of State, the key department in the Vatican\u2019s central administration.\n\nCalls to Di Ruzza\u2019s cell phone went unanswered. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the other officials.\n\nA senior Vatican source said he was aware of the suspension of four employees from the Secretariat of State but not of Di Ruzza\u2019s suspension.\n\nVatican police raided both offices on Tuesday and seized documents and electronic devices as part of an investigation of suspected financial irregularities.\n\nTuesday\u2019s raid is believed to be the first time the two departments were searched for evidence involving alleged financial crimes.\n\nThe Secretariat of State, the most powerful department in the Vatican, is the nerve center of its bureaucracy and diplomacy and the administrative heart of the worldwide Catholic Church.\n\nThe AIF, headed by Swiss lawyer Rene Bruelhart, Di Ruzza\u2019s boss, is the financial controller, with authority over all Vatican departments.\n\nATTEMPT TO CLEAN UP IMAGE\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Vatican said the operation was a follow-up to complaints filed in the summer by the Vatican bank and the Office of the Auditor General and were related to \u201cfinancial operations carried out over the course of time\u201d.\n\nSince Francis\u2019 election in 2013, the Vatican has tried to clean up its financial reputation.\n\nLast year, a former head of the Vatican bank and an Italian lawyer went on trial to face charges of money laundering and embezzlement through real estate deals. It is still in progress.\n\nThe AIF said in May that reports of suspicious financial activity in the Vatican reached a six-year low in 2018, continuing a trend officials said showed reforms were in place.\n\nThe bank, officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion, or IOR, was for decades embroiled in numerous financial scandals as Italians with no right to have accounts opened them with the complicity of corrupt insiders.\n\nHundreds of IOR accounts were closed at the bank, whose stated purpose is to manage funds for the Church, Vatican employees, religious institutes or Catholic charities.\n\nItaly put the Vatican on its \u201cwhite list\u201d of states with cooperative financial institutions in 2017, ending years of mistrust.\n\nMoneyval, a monitoring body of the Council of Europe, gave Vatican financial reforms a mostly positive evaluation in a review the same year.\n\n(This story fixes day of week in first paragraph.)", "description": "Five Vatican employees, including the number two at the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF) and a monsignor, have been suspended following a police raid, the Italian magazine L'Espresso reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436250178&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9110P"}
