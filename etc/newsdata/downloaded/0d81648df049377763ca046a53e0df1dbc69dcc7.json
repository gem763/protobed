The wedding deaths occurred days after a U.S. drone strike killed 32 pine nut harvesters but which officials said was aimed at militants.\n\nOn Sunday night, members of the wedding party were caught in the crossfire of explosions and bullets during a U.S.-backed Afghan government force raid on a nearby Islamist hideout, officials in Helmand said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s marchers demanded an investigation into the deaths and justice for the victims.\n\nThough the protest was peaceful as it wound through the city\u2019s main bazaar, anger was palpable as demonstrators chanted a call for death to the civilians\u2019 killers, a Reuters reporter said.\n\nSome said civilians had been deliberately targeted, others expressed fatigue at the frequency of such events.\n\n\u201cThese incidents happen in every corner of the country every day, yet there is no responsible agency to ask to investigate them,\u201d said Abdul Wali.\n\nLast week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday, he called for \u201cextra caution\u201d in military operations and ordered investigations.\n\nTHE RAID\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was responsible for each of the deaths.\n\nAfghan officials said a house being used by the Taliban to train suicide bombers was located next to the bride\u2019s home that came under fire during Sunday night\u2019s commando assault in the Musa Qala area of Helmand.\n\nColonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said on Monday most of these killed were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests.\n\nA Taliban spokesman said the U.S. and government forces killed the wedding guests.\n\nOn Tuesday, Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence service said that Afghan forces killed six al Qaeda and 17 Taliban members and arrested 14 others.\n\nAmong the captured were five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national, the defense ministry said separately.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet two weeks ago abruptly ended Washington\u2019s peace talks with the Taliban, the hopes of many Afghans after almost 18 years of war were shattered. They fear the war will not end and civilians will continue to be killed.\n\n\u201cPeople have no option but to stand against these incidents and those who oppose peace,\u201d said Wali, the marcher. \u201cPeace is our priority and the warring sides should listen to the people.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of Afghans marched on Tuesday in protest against the deaths of at least 40 wedding party guests who were caught in the crossfire of a clash between U.S.-backed government forces and Islamist militants.", "authors": ["Mohammad Stanekzai", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
