But he has said he cannot rule out the possibility of further photographs emerging - claiming not to have remembered the instances exposed so far, including a high school talent contest in which he wore blackface to sing Harry Belafonte's 1956 hit \"Banana Boat Song (Day-O)\".\n\nThe first photo to emerge showed Mr Trudeau, then a 29-year-old teacher, wearing brownface for a party at his private school Credit: The View Yearbook/Reuters More\n\nMr Trudeau's ministers have stood behind him, although foreign minister Chrystia Freeland said she was \"troubled\" and \"disappointed\". Defence minister Harjit Sajjan, a practicing Sikh, said: \"I know these photos do not represent the person he is now.\"\n\nThe furor has spread way beyond Canada's borders. On stage at a Royal Television Society event on Friday, British comedian Lenny Henry opened with: \u201cNice to see you all. I am Justin Trudeau.\u201d US President Donald Trump remarked that he was \"surprised\", adding: \"I was more surprised when I saw the number of times.\"\n\nMr Trudeau's speech in Toronto was designed to refocus domestic attention on the issues, amid a spike in gun violence in Canada\u2019s most populous city, with minority neighbourhoods particularly affected.\n\n\u201cAs I stand here today, I think about the thousands of families who have lost a loved one to gun violence,\u201d Mr Trudeau said. \u201cPeople are dying, families are grieving, communities are suffering\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister announced he will ban military assault rifles and allow provinces to restrict handguns if he is re-elected in October.\n\nMr Trudeau gave his speech near Toronto\u2019s Greektown, where a gunman killed two and injured thirteen in a mass shooting last year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being quite intentional about making this announcement in Toronto, where violence is on the rise and where there is a huge number of racialised Canadians,\u201d said Kate Harrison, vice president of Summa Strategies.", "description": "Justin Trudeau attempted to get his re-election campaign back on track on Friday with a visit to Toronto, Canada's most diverse city, as the scandal over him wearing blackface on multiple occasions continued to unfold.", "authors": ["Charlie Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MWNppMiZkpj3ZwalXKdKrA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/49e8c22f949c012db830561d73226707"}
