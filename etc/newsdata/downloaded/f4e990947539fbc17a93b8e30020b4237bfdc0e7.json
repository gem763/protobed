She immediately phoned the police and her local council.\n\nOn Saturday, she began hearing from alarmed shoppers in the area of a group handing out leaflets in front of a huge mobile poster with her face on it, next to a picture of a dead foetus. There were other messages online: \u2018Your MP is working hard to take away my human rights.\u2019\n\nOvernight, another vast poster was put up on the side of a building with StopStella.com printed on it and the same message as before, alongside a picture of what purported to be a \u2018nine-week living foetus\u2019.\n\n\u2018I was getting calls from people saying their children were crying, asking, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d It was clearly not a nine-week foetus but a much older one.\u2019 Stella campaigned for terminations in Northern Ireland to be seen as a medical matter, not a legal one, for years.\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy, 42, (pictured) who has been targeted by anti-abortionist campaigners, explained why she refuses to be silenced\n\nIn July MPs approved an amendment she proposed to extend abortion rights there \u2014 the only part of the UK where it remained illegal.\n\nShe knows she is being targeted now precisely because she is carrying a child: \u2018One of the images, I am sure, was chosen because it was around the same gestation as my own baby,\u2019 she tells me. \u2018Do they think my work campaigning for women to be supported through abortion means I have to abort my own baby?\u2019\n\nStella, like so many female MPs, is used to harassment. One man was jailed for 18 weeks after retweeting messages threatening to rape her. His abuse had been so relentless, she had to have a panic button installed in her home.\n\nContinual death and rape threats have come from other trolls. A restraining order has been placed on one woman who sent her messages every day for 18 months. Another stalker, who\u2019d harassed her for ten years, was convicted in June.\n\nBut this latest campaign \u2014 by the UK branch of the American anti-abortion group, Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform \u2014 she says is particularly vile. \u2018It\u2019s disgusting and deeply upsetting, but if they think they are going to silence me, they are wrong.\u2019\n\nPolice have refused to act, she says, largely because there is no clear legislation stating this is a hate crime. She adds that two home secretaries have told her the law is there to deal with situations like this \u2014 and yet the intimidation goes on.\n\n\u2018I am in no doubt that this is trying to incite violence. I have been told leaflets and posters are \u201cpassive\u201d, but this is targeting me on a personal level. I believe passionately in free speech, but you have to conduct yourself in a way that is reasonable.\n\n\u2018How can this not be a hate crime? My staff were told it is because I am having a baby. If this was about my sexuality or my skin colour then it would be clear it is a hate crime. And yet it is about me as a woman.\n\nStella has been accused of trying to take away human rights, a banner recently appeared of a \u2018nine-week living foetus\u2019 with the words StopStella.com\n\n\u2018We need a better understanding of what harassment is and we need to make misogyny a hate crime too.\u2019\n\nStella does not know what she can do about the position of local police but the people of Walthamstow and the council, however, have stood full square behind her: Within hours of the poster\u2019s appearance someone had whitewashed it.\n\nThe latest campaign against Stella should be viewed alongside her own devastating back story.\n\nShe has spent four years trying to become a mother, suffering at least two miscarriages. Both happened very close to the 12-week hurdle \u2014 the moment when expectant mothers get to send excited emails and texts to friends and loved ones, and allow themselves to start thinking of the new life that awaits them.\n\n\u2018Miscarriage really does rip your soul,\u2019 Stella says. \u2018The second time I was already anxious because of what had happened before. But [as the weeks passed] it was going so well. I was hoping and hoping, and then I did start to think, \u201cActually, perhaps this time I don\u2019t need to worry\u201d. And then it went wrong.\u2019\n\nWe need a better understanding of what harassment is and we need to make misogyny a hate crime too\n\nHer most recent miscarriage happened last year. She went for a scan with her partner of 13 years, Dan Fox, only to be told the foetus no longer had a heartbeat. Women who have suffered miscarriage will know how awful this news is. It was another hope gone. Devastated, she cried.\n\n\u2018Of course, I blamed myself. Of course I thought, \u201cWhat did I do wrong? What is wrong with me physically that might make this happen?\u201d\n\n\u2018I come from a very loving and supportive family and my mum and dad were super excited and therefore you feel the pain [for them too].\n\n\u2018I know my partner will make an amazing father, so when it doesn\u2019t of course you feel devastated and, of course, you blame yourself.\u2019\n\nStella (pictured) who is 30 weeks pregnant, has spent four years trying to become a mother while experiencing at least two miscarriages\n\nAfter her first miscarriage in 2016, even though bleeding and suffering contractions, she joined a protest outside the Indian High Commission to extradite a man who had raped and murdered a constituent.\n\nShe scheduled the necessary medical procedure for a day she didn\u2019t have a constituency advice surgery.\n\nStella adopted this \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach because, she says, she was in so much distress, she didn\u2019t know how to talk about it. Last year, too, after finding out her baby\u2019s heart was no longer beating, she went back to her constituency and chaired a public meeting about knife crime.\n\n\u2018I thought, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the people of Walthamstow down\u201d, so I stood in front of hundreds of them knowing my baby had died inside me, thinking, \u201cbut what really matters now is tackling knife crime\u201d.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying keeping going is the right thing to do, but that was the thing I chose to do.\u2019\n\nNow Stella, 42, is starting to feel hopeful about the new life she is carrying. \u2018I\u2019m a positively geriatric first-time mum,\u2019 she says, a smile spreading across her face.\n\nThe baby is more than twice as developed as her lost babies, and if born today \u2014 heaven forbid \u2014 would stand a good chance of survival.\n\nI have to manage my anxiety by letting myself think the worst and I\u2019ll do that until the baby is born\n\nDuring this pregnancy, she has taken a friend\u2019s advice and stopped watching the TV fly-on-the-wall maternity ward series One Born Every Minute. \u2018She said, \u201cStella, step away from it. It won\u2019t help your anxiety\u201d.\u2019\n\nDespite her ordeal this week, Stella is clearly thrilled and, to use that old-fashioned word, \u2018blooming\u2019. But her fears persist.\n\nShe says: \u2018I haven\u2019t allowed myself to think it will be OK. When I talk to other women, they get it. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not excited. I\u2019m hugely excited by the possibility that this pregnancy will work, but I\u2019m also cautious as I know that pain that comes when you lose the hope. It would be disrespectful to other women who\u2019ve been in my position to pretend I\u2019m not anxious.\n\n\u2018I have to manage my anxiety by letting myself think the worst and I\u2019ll do that until the baby is born.\n\n\u2018It would be inhuman not to be emotional about something like that. The point is whether or not you are aware of your emotions and able to deal with them. But I am.\u2019\n\nEvery time she has a scan, she cries with relief. \u2018I feel so sorry for the sonographers.\u2019\n\nStella (pictured) approached the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to ask for a paid locum in June\n\nStella does not want to reveal whether this pregnancy required medical intervention, out of respect for Dan, but says: \u2018It\u2019s been a longer process than perhaps either of us had imagined.\u2019\n\nEven the worst bits of carrying what she calls her Brexit Baby (due to timing, not ideology) feel like a blessing. \u2018I\u2019m very clumsy.I\u2019m tired, but then that\u2019s me anyway. And I\u2019m hot. And I\u2019m craving milky things: rice pudding, custard. Don\u2019t leave a bowl of cream in front of me because it will be gone in five minutes. \u2018I\u2019ve relied on my really good friends and they\u2019ve put up with me asking crazy questions about their own pregnancies. There are people out there who can be your rock.\u2019\n\nShe has also joined a walking group in her constituency for pregnant mums and new mums \u2018because being a politician is a bit of an endurance task anyway and as an older mum I\u2019m trying to keep fit.\u2019 In fact, until recently, there has only been one problem. The Commons does not give female members \u2014 or men for that matter \u2014 paid parental cover.\n\nMPs like Stella \u2018and I\u2019m not alone\u2019 can take six months off with full pay and vote by proxy, but during this time their constituency goes unrepresented. Case work piles up on their desks, unread. Stella found herself asking: \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t I enjoy my baby for six months without feeling like I\u2019ve let Walthamstow down?\u2019\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be asking women to choose between being a new mum and being a good constituency MP\n\nIn June, she went public by approaching the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to ask for a paid locum, the first request it had ever received.\n\nShe figured a stand-in should be paid (as in the Civil Service and in most corporate environments), so her workload could be covered in her absence. \u2018My mum, who was a special school head teacher, is an amazing woman. She combined that with being a mother. It never once occurred to me that you couldn\u2019t live life to its fullest.\n\n\u2018And yet when I talked to the parliamentary authorities, it was like, \u201cWell, this doesn\u2019t happen\u201d.\u2019\n\nShe told them that of course it does happen, but until now, women have just put up with it.\n\nIn January, her colleague Tulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, postponed a caesarean section to vote in the debate on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nDays after her baby was born, she had to return to case work. Some female MPs have taken precious time with their babies, praying their constituents don\u2019t notice, while others try to breastfeed during meetings.\n\n\u2018Given I\u2019ve worked so hard to get this baby, it seems a shame to then say, \u201cOK, I\u2019m not going to spend any time with it\u201d,\u2019 says Stella.\n\nStella (pictured) admits that she will stand as an MP again, despite not entirely agreeing with any Labour leader\n\n\u2018And this isn\u2019t just about me. We shouldn\u2019t be asking women to choose between being a new mum and being a good constituency MP.\u2019\n\nIn a landmark decision, IPSA has agreed that her maternity leave can be covered, \u2018so I\u2019ll be advertising for the first-ever locum for an MP.\u2019 However, IPSA maintains a case-by-case approach. Stella says what is needed is a policy.\n\nMaternity cover is as important for attracting a new generation of female MPs, she says, as campaigning for earlier voting sessions or the ability to vote from home.\n\n\u2018You have good days and bad days,\u2019 she says of her job.\n\n\u2018But rather than asking women how they cope, we should be saying, \u201cWho thinks this is acceptable?\u201d\n\n\u2018Because there are many extraordinary women out there who we [as a country] are missing out on [because of their fear], and because we just say, \u201cOh well, that\u2019s politics, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a fight. I\u2019m not prepared to live in Gilead [the misogynist state in Margaret Atwood novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale]. These people are not going to win. They\u2019re just not going to win.\u2019\n\nMy mum said to me that maybe now, having a baby, I might stop for a moment. I suspect that is not true\n\nWithin Labour, too, from the far- Left Momentum wing, she has encountered put-downs and misogyny. However, her loyalty to the party remains, although it is not the one she joined at 16.\n\n\u2018Let me be honest, I\u2019ve never entirely agreed with any Labour leader. Today is no different.\n\n\u2018Am I up for the fight? At the moment, yes. Who knows what I will feel in the future? I\u2019ve said I\u2019m going to stand as an MP again. There is so much more we can change, and change can take a bloody long time.\u2019\n\nStella says there has been no shortage of offers from constituents to help with childcare after she returns to work.\n\nAdd to that her hands-on partner Dan, \u2018the kindest, cleverest man I know\u2019, and her close-knit family, and there can be little doubt she will excel at juggling work with parenthood.\n\n\u2018My mum said to me that maybe now, having a baby, I might stop for a moment. I suspect that is not true. She didn\u2019t stop.\u2019", "description": "Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is 30 weeks pregnant explained why she will not be silenced by anti-abortion campaigners.
