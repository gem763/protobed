Yes, Virginia, traders, and investors still react to those, pretty strongly if simple price charts are any indication. Take this chart of the New York daily closing price of silver for the last 6 months.\n\nSilver 6 Month Chart\n\nPretty simple right? The point that really jumps out of this chart is how silver seems to hang around, jump off, or dive through whole-dollar price levels. (In trading we talk points, in this case, a point is a US Dollar.)\n\nThis is where the most simple trading method comes from. Swing trading is when you buy something when it rises above a price level, and sell when it drops below a price level, usually over a period of weeks or months.\n\nThe space in between levels is called \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d because no sane man would start a new trade here \u2013 you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going up or down in between.\n\nRight now, for example, we can see silver\u2019s latest \u201cmove\u201d was bouncing off 17, and now we\u2019re waiting to see if it gets to 18. If it doesn\u2019t get to 18 \u2013 well, then it would be time to short silver if it drops below 17.\n\nThese whole-dollar levels are called psychological levels for good reason. People get confused when talking about single cents, and price in cents fluctuates almost by the second. But dollar levels tend to be more stable, with enough time in between to think and consider and plan.\n\nIt seems simple enough. As a place to start, it\u2019s pretty good. But it takes a bit more refinement and some allowances to make sure you\u2019re not driving yourself nuts trading in-out-in-out during those times it\u2019s fluctuating around a level. That\u2019s a discussion for another day\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER: No specific security was mentioned in this article. The author is long the silver sector via small positions in USLV, PAAS and SVBL.
