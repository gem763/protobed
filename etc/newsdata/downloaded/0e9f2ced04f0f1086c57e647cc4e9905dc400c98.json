I had no idea I\u2019d published so many. My husband\u2019s quick comeback: \u201cI had no idea I\u2019d eaten so many.\u201d\n\nMy recipes are gathered from places too wide to corral. No trip is a success for me unless I return with a recipe or an idea for one. Somewhere in a notebook I started in the 1970s, there are instructions for a Burgundian chocolate cake I had at an inn near the cloisters in Cluny. I\u2019ve never been able to make it work, but I remember how pleased I was that the chef wrote down the basics for me on a sheet torn from a server\u2019s order pad. I\u2019ve gotten recipes from home cooks, famous chefs and vendors in outdoor markets. A cookie recipe came to me in a note from a reader. A Parisian hairdresser told me how to roast pineapple with rum and spices. Just last week, my daughter-in-law called from Italy to say that she was returning home with a recipe she\u2019d nabbed for a chocolate tart that was kind of like tiramis\u00f9, but not. I have recipes from cooks far away and from neighbors down the street. They come from everywhere except my childhood. There isn\u2019t a single recipe from my family, including from my mom.\n\nI remember my mother in a soft cashmere wrap coat, a sequined cocktail dress (that\u2019s what she was wearing when she came home to find that I\u2019d burned down the kitchen) and in Capri pants with kitten heels. I can\u2019t ever recall her in an apron. I don\u2019t remember her cooking. Anything. Instead, I remember her saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Let\u2019s go to the once-famous Brooklyn seafood house Lundy\u2019s, for steamers we\u2019d drag through clam broth and dunk in melted butter. Let\u2019s go to Jahn\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor for hot-fudge sundaes. Let\u2019s go buy as many different kinds of olives as we can find. My mother loved food, but she didn\u2019t cook it and she didn\u2019t want to.", "description": "A workingwoman of the \u201950s, my mother did not cook \u2014 except for this one perfect dish.", "authors": ["Dorie Greenspan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/21/magazine/22mag-eat/22mag-eat-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
