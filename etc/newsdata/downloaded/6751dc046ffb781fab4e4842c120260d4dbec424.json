Yet the opioid problem is far larger than one drug company, or even the entire industry. Preventing abuse of addictive drugs requires improvements in countless nooks and crannies of public policy.\n\nChicago\u2019s experience fighting opioids offers a lesson in what municipalities can and can\u2019t do to stem public-health crises. While I was mayor, the Windy City became one of the first two cities in the country to sue the pharmaceutical industry. After filing the lawsuit, we took additional immediate steps to reduce the drug supply. Last year we modified all municipal labor contracts to specify that no health plan could authorize more than a seven-day supply of addictive painkillers, except in extreme circumstances such as end-of-life care.\n\nMy administration also imposed a $750 annual licensing fee on medical sales representatives within the city limits, and dedicated 100% of that revenue to drug rehabilitation. Today more than 4,000 drug-industry personnel in Chicago have registered and paid the fee, creating a multimillion-dollar fund that goes directly to clinics and specialists helping victims overcome their addictions. We also coordinated responses with officials from Cook and DuPage counties. Without these changes, the epidemic in the Chicago area would be much worse\u2014and it is still bad.\n\nWhy was Chicago forced to confront the opioid problem on its own? Because those who should have shouldered the burden refused to lead. The federal government has the resources, authority and mandate to stem national public-health emergencies. But its agencies were AWOL, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Meanwhile, doctors and pharmacies spent their time pointing fingers rather than policing bad actors. That left local governments, short-staffed and ill-equipped, on their own. None of this absolves the drug companies and distributors for their role in the tragedy. But as someone who was screaming for help from one of America\u2019s city halls, I can tell you it was maddening and disheartening.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt what Washington and its regulatory agencies could have done if they wanted to address the crisis. And these policy options are still on the table.\n\nTo begin, they should require every pharmacy regularly to provide a list of the five doctors and dentists who most frequently prescribe opiates, as a way to encourage caution among hospitals and doctors. Before anyone shouts \u201cPrivacy!\u201d note that I am recommending doctors\u2019 names, not patients\u2019. Current federal law bars cities from mandating that sort of disclosure, but it would be a vital deterrent.\n\nNext, the federal judge presiding over the larger opioid settlement under negotiation in Cleveland should ensure that a minimum of 50 cents of every dollar awarded goes directly to rehabilitation. A generation ago, when the tobacco settlement money rolled in, it was too frequently used to fill ordinary gaps in state and local budgets rather than to save another generation from tobacco addiction.\n\nLast, the FDA and other federal agencies should create separate guidelines for prescribing opioids to children and teenagers, whose capacity to handle these medications is different. Young people need more-stringent protections.\n\nMore than any other factor, the public origin of the opioid epidemic is what makes it such a monumental disgrace\u2014what my Yiddish-speaking grandparents would\u2019ve called a shanda. Unlike with other addictive substances like crack or heroin, the opioid epidemic didn\u2019t begin in dark alleyways or on desolate street corners. Pharmaceutical companies played down the risks and overstated the efficacy of opioids\u2014a shanda. Doctors and dentists regularly overprescribed opioids, many of which ended up on the black market, sparking new demand\u2014a shanda. Pharmacists established \u201cpill mills,\u201d looking away when addicts lined up time and again for refills\u2014a shanda. And government regulators looked the other way as hundreds of thousands of Americans became addicted\u2014a shanda.\n\nOpioids won\u2019t be the last public-health crisis. If policy makers fail to learn the right lessons, cities and states across the country may end up filing similar suits in five or 10 years against companies now selling e-cigarettes and hash oil to Americans. The question is whether leaders will find a way to stem the next crisis before it\u2019s too late, with little to do other than pursue lawsuits for restorative damages.\n\nThe greatest lesson is that states and cities shouldn\u2019t have to face public-health crises on their own. I made Chicago the first city to tax, regulate and sue those selling and manufacturing vaping products, and I\u2019m proud to have been ahead of the curve. But the best approach is collective responsibility and accountability, in which each level of government and corporate associations plays its role.\n\nThe opioid epidemic began at the highest levels of corporate of America, was abetted by the most respected professional associations, and was ignored by the most trusted government agencies. As we face the vaping and hash-oil industries, the question is whether we\u2019ve learned anything.\n\nMr. Emanuel was mayor of Chicago, 2011-19.", "description": "Cities and states can mitigate public-health risks, but they need more help from Washington.", "authors": ["Rahm Emanuel"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107865/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
