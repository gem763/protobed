(REI) is promoting environmental action instead of the tradition of shopping on Black Friday for its employees and members.\n\nThe outdoor retail company is asking its 13,000 employees and 18 million members to \u201copt to act\u201d by assisting in cleaning up outdoor areas on Black Friday and sign up for a 52-week action plan designed to reduce their individual environmental footprints, according to a release from the company.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cToday, that future is at risk,\u201d REI CEO Eric Artz wrote in\n\na letter\n\nthis week. \u201cWe are in the throes of an environmental crisis that threatens not only the next 81 years of the co-op, but the incredible outdoor places that we love.\u201d\n\nThe press release states that employees have already collected more than 3.4 tons of garbage while cleaning up outdoor areas across the U.S.\n\nREI has closed all stores, halted online payments and paid its employees to #OptOutside on Black Friday since 2015, which the release says has \u201cgrown into a movement.\u201d\n\nArtz stated in his letter that their initial movement was \u201cnot good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a single company, our impact is limited, but as a community, we can drive change that powers meaningful action beyond our walls,\u201d Artz wrote. \u201cAs a co-op, we know that many people taking many small steps together can add up to big changes. Collective intention will drive collective impact.\u201d\n\nREI is also pledging to reduce waste and stop using unnecessary packaging for their products, starting with poly bags used to protect products. The outdoor retailer says it is also making efforts to increase its rental and used gears and meet zero-waste goals. The company acknowledges it won\u2019t meet its 2020 zero-waste goal in every store due to changing recycling markets and different infrastructure from city to city.\n\n\u201cBut a single company can only do so much,\u201d the press release states. \u201cThat\u2019s why the co-op is also inviting its 18 million members, more than 13,000 employees, and the broader retail industry to take up the fight.\u201d", "description": "Recreational Equipment, Inc.
