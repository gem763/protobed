The Mayor and council then released a statement condemning all hunting.\n\nA council spokesperson said in a statement: \"\u201cThis Council declares its complete opposition to any form of hunting live animals with hounds or shooting live game, in the UK or overseas. We note that this is barbaric in all cases, and in many cases also threatens species that are already precarious.\"\n\nOne of the companies listed to exhibit in Liverpool was Engelbrecht Safaris, which allows hunters to kill leopards, elephants and giraffes in Africa.\n\nHowever, many of the exhibitors at the show were companies representing British hunters who shoot small game in the UK such as pheasants and grouse.\n\nGarry Doolan, a spokesman for the British Association of Shooting and Conservation said: \u201cJoe Anderson and some members of the council appear to have mixed up trophy hunting in Africa with shooting pheasants in places like Altcar.", "description": "A local council has been accused of confusing pheasant-shooting with lion hunting by pressuring the venue of Crufts to cancel a shooting show.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Liam Halligan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000071772565-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ9XL2X431wTPNFE7gDJFdQ1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
