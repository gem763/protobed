The Nasdaq Composite reversed an early loss to add about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%.\n\nMajor indexes have drifted higher in recent sessions as investors have parsed third-quarter earnings results. On Friday, losses in shares of Amazon.com and big retailers were outweighed by gains in tech companies, helping lift the S&P 500 just a hair from its record hit in July.\n\nModest moves in the broader market have been underpinned by large swings in shares of individual companies. Investors continued to look to corporate results for broader cues on the health of the economy, driving big moves under the surface on Friday.\n\nIntel raised its outlook for the year Thursday after it posted an increase in third-quarter earnings, sending shares 7.1% higher in early trading.\n\nCharter Communications rose 6.8% after the cable company's third-quarter profit fell less than expected and revenue beat forecasts.\n\nShares of Amazon.com dropped about 2.5% after the tech giant reported a 26% fall in profit as it invested heavily to speed up shipping times.\n\nSome investors attributed the muted moves in major U.S. stock indexes to little news on trade between the U.S. and China. Additionally, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, with many girding for an interest rate cut.\n\n\"We know that's not going to last forever,\" said John Zaller, chief investment officer of MAI Capital Management, of the recent market calm.\n\nOn Friday, the University of Michigan issued the final results of its October consumer sentiment survey, showing that Americans' feelings about the economy declined slightly. Earlier in the month retail sales figures showed that consumers pulled back on spending in September.\n\nIn Europe, fresh economic data and corporate earnings continued to paint a mixed picture of how the biggest businesses in the region are doing.\n\nThe pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged about 0.1% lower, led by declines in the food and beverages sector.\n\nThe outlook for growth and inflation in the eurozone over the coming years was lowered by forecasters surveyed by the European Central Bank. Adding to the subdued economic outlook, market-research group GfK said German consumer sentiment is set to worsen in November, while business expectations in the country improved slightly, according to the Ifo Institute.\n\n\"We are still waiting for a proper rebound\" in economic growth in Germany, said Inga Fechner, an economist at ING. Business sentiment remains weak amid worrying signs from the country's services sector, she added.\n\nRussia's central bank on Friday cut rates by half a percentage point -- the fourth cut since June and the largest to date -- highlighting the risk of a global economic slowdown.\n\nThe British pound dropped 0.3% against the U.S. dollar, after earlier having recovered from an even sharper drop Thursday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a snap general election on Dec. 12 in an effort to pressure his political opponents to back his Brexit deal. The 10-year U.K. gilt yield rose to 0.645% in recent trading, from 0.627%\n\n\"The continued uncertainty over Brexit is hanging over markets today,\" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com and Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 11:08 ET (15:08 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
