Lack has been accused of botching a variety of sexual misconduct issues, ranging from his claim that Ronan Farrow\u2019s award-winning coverage of Harvey Weinstein wasn\u2019t fit to print to insisting that the investigation into Matt Lauer\u2019s lewd workplace behavior be conducted by fellow NBC executives instead of an outside entity.\n\nBut allegations against Lack aren\u2019t limited to covering up for the sexual misconduct of others, he\u2019s also been accused of a variety of wrongdoings himself. The New York Post\u2019s Page Six obtained an excerpt of Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which has long been expected to generate an onslaught of negative publicity for the beleaguered NBC News boss.\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES\n\nAccording to the Post, the book cites an alleged victim who claims that Lack \u201cpreyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them\u201d throughout his career.\n\nThe Post also indicated that Farrow\u2019s book features former CBS News anchor Jane Wallace openly discussing her 1980s affair with the then-married Lack while he was her executive producer and boss. Wallace reportedly told Farrow that Lack was \u201calmost unrelenting\u201d in his desire to take her out to dinner and celebrate her new contract \u2013 which led to a consensual sexual affair.\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna say? You know if you say \u2018I don\u2019t want to celebrate with you,\u2019 you\u2019re asking for trouble,\u201d Wallace says in the book, according to the Post. \u201cI got worked over.\u201d\n\nThe extramarital affair didn\u2019t last, and Lack reportedly turned on his former fling.\n\n\u201cEventually, Wallace claimed Lack bullied her out of the job she loved \u2014 and lorded his power over her \u2014 when their relationship soured,\u201d Page Six reporter Sara Nathan wrote before noting that Farrow\u2019s book details Wallace\u2019s claim that she was intimidated into signing a binding nondisclosure agreement with a \u201csubstantial payout\u201d to protect Lack.\n\nAccording to the Post, Wallace told Farrow that she \u201cloved that job\u201d and reluctantly walked away because of Lack\u2019s behavior.\n\nA source close to Lack denied Wallace\u2019s version of events, telling the Post \u201cthe charges of retaliation are just not true.\u201d\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED\n\nWallace isn\u2019t the only extramarital sexual partner of Lack who spoke to Farrow, according to the Post.\n\nA young production assistant reportedly told Farrow that she had an affair with Lack, but things got ugly once it ended. Farrow reportedly wrote that Lack wouldn\u2019t allow her to be reassigned and \u201ccompelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d\n\nJennifer Laird told Farrow, \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a reason you don\u2019t get involved with your boss,\u201d according to the Post.\n\n\u201cIn the book, a rep denied Lack ever took retaliatory action against Laird,\u201d Nathan wrote.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2018 The Daily Beast published a bombshell report headlined, \u201cAccused sexual harassers thrived under NBC News chief Andy Lack,\u201d which detailed how scandals always seemed to emerge under his leadership.\n\nMADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\nLack was the president of NBC News from 1993 until 2001 and returned to the Peacock Network in 2015 after top jobs at Sony Music and Bloomberg in between.\n\nCiting sources, the Beast reported that Lack \u201cprotected a male employee who sexually harassed multiple women\u201d when he was a Sony executive in between stints at NBC News.\n\nWhile Lack was in power at Sony, music executive Charlie Walk reportedly sent \u201cvery graphic and totally inappropriate\u201d pornography to female staffers, according to the Beast.\n\n\u201cAndy didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d a former Sony executive told the Beast.\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE\n\nAfter Sony, Lack went to work running the Bloomberg Media Group, where he reportedly hinted at his longtime pal Lauer\u2019s affairs well before he would return to NBC and fire the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host for sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cDuring the Bloomberg years, according to two people who worked alongside Lack, he regularly boasted of his close friendship with Lauer and spoke of knowing that Lauer was unfaithful to his then-wife,\u201d the Beast reported.\n\nAn NBC spokesperson disputed this when reached by the Beast last year.\n\nDespite all of the issues surrounding Lack, he has a powerful longtime ally in Stephen Burke, the executive vice president of NBC\u2019s parent Comcast and CEO of NBCUniversal. Burke defended Lack to The Daily Beast and an NBC insider told Fox News prior to excerpts from \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d emerging that Burke buys Lack\u2019s narrative that Farrow has an axe to grind when it comes to the Peacock Network.\n\nRONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR\n\nNBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a series of questions from Fox News, including whether or not the company and Burke still stand behind Lack and a request for comment on Farrow\u2019s book in general.\n\nFox News has not seen Farrow\u2019s \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In addition to new information regarding Lack\u2019s personal wrongdoings, the book is expected to reveal other significant damaging information related to NBC News.\n\nOn Lack\u2019s watch the now-disgraced Weinstein reportedly leveraged NBC executives to stop Farrow from exposing him as a sexual predator with scandalous information regarding Lauer.\n\nThe former \u201cToday\u201d anchor was ultimately fired weeks after Farrow exposed Weinstein in his Pulitzer Prize-winning piece that was published in The New Yorker after NBC passed on it.\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\n\"Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it,\u201d Farrow wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nLack refused to allow an outside counsel to investigate who knew about Lauer\u2019s sexual wrongdoings. Instead of enlisting a white-shoe law firm \u2013 which has been standard for other news organizations dealing with sexual harassment during the #MeToo era \u2013 NBC allowed in-house General Counsel Kim Harris to conduct the review.\n\nHarris\u2019 internal review eventually declared that Lack and NBC management were completely oblivious to Lauer\u2019s pervy behavior. The heavily criticized internal review contradicted the Beast report that Lack knew \u201cLauer was unfaithful\u201d to his wife years before the #MeToo movement changed corporate culture across America.\n\nLAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'\n\nFarrow\u2019s book will also contradict the internal review, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cFarrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements \u2014 many with hush-money payouts \u2014 to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,\u201d THR reporter Marisa Guthrie wrote. \"NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Lack\u2019s news organization to the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold just in time to potentially hurt Trump weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting that NBC News passed on. The tape derailed the career of then-NBC host Billy Bush and Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.\n\nLack\u2019s top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, is an old college buddy of Fahrenthold from their time together at Harvard University. NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the tape to Fahrenthold -- who with Oppenheim is also tied from Harvard to investor Marc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to THR, which got access to the book, \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d will reveal that Clinton\u2019s publicist Nick Merrill informed Weinstein that Farrow was poking around lewd accusations against him in the first place.", "description": "Embattled NBC News Chairman Andy Lack has managed to cling to his job amid a laundry list of scandals but a new spotlight has been placed on the media honcho as tidbits from Ronan Farrow\u2019s highly anticipated book slowly emerge.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
