During the third quarter, Burger King rolled out its Impossible Whopper nationwide, Popeye\u2019s sparked the chicken sandwich wars \u2014 which helped spark the chain\u2019s best sales in almost 20 years \u2014 and Tim Hortons collaborated with plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat (BYND).\n\nBurger King\u2019s nationwide rollout of the Impossible Whopper in August boosted food traffic significantly for the burger chain, with Cil boasting 15% international sales growth and 5% comp sales domestically \u2014 the company\u2019s best since 2015.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays studied the increase in foot traffic at Burger King locations in St. Louis, where the initial Impossible Whopper tests ran in April. The data found that traffic jumped 18% in St. Louis Burger King stores during the test period, while there was no traffic gain at St. Louis McDonald\u2019s (MCD) locations and Burger King\u2019s Kansas City stores.\n\nA sign posted outside Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen states that the restaurant is out of their new chicken sandwiches in New York, U.S., August 23, 2019.

Recent reports have suggested that the chicken sandwich could return to menus as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had a very high quality product at a very attractive price point,\u201d Popeyes America\u2019s President Felipe Athayde previously told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \u201cOne thing is to predict high demand, the other thing is when you have 50 people lined up outside of the restaurant at 9 a.m. when the restaurant opens at 10 a.m.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, Tim Hortons announced in June that it would be selling Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches across almost 4,000 Tim Hortons locations across the country. But after about three months, the coffee chain said that it would be pulling the Beyond Meat products from most menus except for in Ontario and British Columbia. Cil noted that it was a challenging quarter for the Canadian chain, but said the company is committed to its long-term growth.\n\nPrior to Monday\u2019s results, Restaurant Brands stock rose nearly 34% this year, while the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC) jumped 22% in the same time period.\n\nThe conference call with management kicks off at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThis post is developing.
