Flowers are subordinate to the overall effect. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nTwo years after an army of volunteers installed thousands of little nondescript plant plugs, a two-acre field of perennials and grasses near the Delaware shore has sprouted into a beguiling meadow conceived by the prominent Dutch plant designer Piet Oudolf.\n\nIn September, the garden is more a medley of textures and end-of-season earth tones than an explosion of color \u2014 that occurred over the summer \u2014 but its power and depth are not subdued.\n\nI adore this expression of gardening for loads of reasons: It\u2019s naturalistic, it\u2019s dynamic, it gets more interesting with each passing month of the season. For its maker, it allows countless permutations of plant combos. For the viewer, no matter how seasoned, it provides the thrill of discovering new varieties.\n\nBut you can judge for yourself.\n\nThe 70,000-plant composition forms the centerpiece of one of the nation\u2019s newest public gardens, the Delaware Botanic Gardens, which opened in the unlikely setting of a former soybean field and creek-side woodland near Dagsboro, Del., a dozen miles west of Bethany Beach.\n\n\n\nThe two-acre stylized meadow at the Delaware Botanic Gardens is the latest project of Dutch plant designer Piet Oudolf.

(Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nThe 37-acre attraction is a work in progress; the meadow and woodland are ready to be enjoyed, and basic infrastructure is in place, but the main visitor center, a central water feature and other key elements have yet to appear. Other design professionals involved in the project include RAS Landscape Architects in Media, Pa., and the San Antonio architects Lake/Flato.\n\nThe enterprise is not the product of a wealthy entrepreneur or corporation, driven rather by an eager band of individuals who have tapped into the goodwill of the local business community and other donors in southern Delaware and who found grants from an array of foundations. The land is owned by a conservation trust.\n\n\u201cEvery time I think the world is coming to an end, this project breathes new life into me,\u201d says Ray Sander, the garden\u2019s president.\n\nSander said the goal is to get 30,000 visitors in the first season. Oudolf, who is listening keenly, chimes in: \u201cIt\u2019ll get those, but you need a coffee bar. And an espresso machine, not filtered coffee.\u201d Sander is silent, a little nonplussed. The European epicure persists. \u201cAnd a good croissant.\u201d\n\nThe gardening team is small, headed by Brian Trader, late of Longwood Gardens, and relies on a corps of volunteers, many of them Delmarva sun-seekers and retirees who have fled workaday Washington and other cities. Oudolf\u2019s participation has elevated its place in the gardening world, and he said he took on the job, in part, because much of his work has been in creating highly private residential gardens that few people will ever get to see. His public commissions in the states have included the High Line in New York and the Lurie Garden in Chicago\u2019s Millennium Park.\n\nThe Delaware garden, in its layout of paths through rather than around an immersive herbaceous landscape, reminds me of a similarly scaled creation at Durslade Farm in England, where the Oudolf Field is part of the art gallery campus known as Hauser & Wirth Somerset.\n\nOudolf sees major differences in the plant palette between them, but in both cases he has transformed what were once empty farm fields. This gets to a point that transcends even Piet Oudolf and the New Perennial Movement. The fact that a shapeless plot can be turned into a garden with its own form, character and, especially, spirit of place is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nOudolf picked up on this point, saying that the metamorphosis here is all the starker for its setting. The High Line has the context of a vibrant city, as does the Lurie Garden. Delaware Botanic Gardens arises on flat land between a country road and a brackish creek. \u201cIt\u2019s in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he says.\n\nCreating so much from nothing gets to the essence and power of garden making. This is why we do it, to create a paradise out of thin air. Dream a space, make it real, and let it speak to us.\n\nWhat does the Oudolf Meadow have to say? For one, that you don\u2019t have to wait long for a garden of perennials and grasses to reach effective maturity. The vigor of the Delaware garden is fueled by the heat and rainfall of its location. (Last year\u2019s record rain actually caused ponding and the death of some grasses.)\n\nOudolf\u2019s gardens function on two basic levels. Broadly, they are a canvas of textures, colors and horizontal lines. Closer up, the plants are in a dance with their immediate neighbors. It\u2019s a hoedown that changes with each step, as your viewpoint shifts, and it\u2019s at this level that you see value in September of seemingly \u201cdead\u201d material \u2014 that is, the ghostly dark remnants of the yarrow blooms of June, the blackened seed heads of coneflowers or the declining remnants of the architectural eryngium known as rattlesnake master. They convey a moribund beauty that is part of what is known as the fifth season, the period of top-growth decline in early to mid-fall as the perennials retreat into the ground for the winter.\n\n\n\nThe yarrow\u2019s summer blooms fade against a backdrop of little bluestem, which will take on a reddish tinge in the fall. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nThe earth tones of retreating plants, here the rattlesnake master, give rise to a time gardeners call the fifth season. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nAs much as I love this effect, I thought the garden would have more color than it did in mid-September. But the asters have yet to produce a show, the pink muhly grass is subdued this year and some perennials saw their flower show compressed by what was another abnormally hot summer, Trader explained.\n\nThere was still much to get the sap flowing. The mountain mints were magnets for a carnival of lesser-spotted pollinators, the mass planting of switch grass proved an effective hedge, bulky but fine textured, and a gigantic variety of blazing star, Liatris pycnostachya, leaned under the weight of its torchlike seed heads.\n\nMore than 300 donors and other supporters gathered Sept. 12 for a dinner marking the opening of the garden. Its limited public hours \u2014 Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings through November \u2014 reflect its reliance on volunteers. (The website is delawaregardens.org.)\n\nIt is fitting that it should open now, toward the replete conclusion of the growing season. The timing shakes up the irrational idea of gardens being for the spring.\n\n\n\nThe Oudolf Meadow consists of 70,000 perennials and grasses and took just two years to be effective. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nOn a hot and clammy day, the slightest breeze causes a ripple of movement through the grasses. The meandering paths lead to a grassy viewing mound and together create 11 discrete beds. The plant beds closer to the barnlike Welcome Center are defined by a matrix of the native grass known as prairie dropseed. The grass is still a couple of years from reaching its full, fine-textured mounds. The distant beds find another organizing grass, two varieties of the little bluestem, upright, dark and destined to become more handsome by October.\n\nFor Oudolf, all this is the fruition of a plant world he has been pushing for almost half a century, though each project is unique in its plantings. As he told the filmmaker Thomas Piper in Piper\u2019s documentary of Oudolf\u2019s work, \u201cIt\u2019s the journey in your life to find out what real beauty is.\u201d\n\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter", "description": "The centerpiece of the newly opened Delaware Botanic Gardens is a 70,000-plant meadow composition by famed Dutch designer Piet Oudolf.", "authors": ["Adrian Higgins", "Gardening Columnist", "September At Am", "Adrian Higgins Has Been Writing About Gardening", "Landscape Design", "Related Environmental Topics Since The Late He Joined The Washington Post In He Is The Author Of Several Books", "Including The", "Washington Post Garden Book", "Chanticleer", "A Pleasure Garden."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xqUULly6TJ-5yX1p1hkrj4q4sM4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MAYRZGW3AUI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
