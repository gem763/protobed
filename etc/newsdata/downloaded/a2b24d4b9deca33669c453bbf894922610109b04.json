They surpassed the record set by last year\u2019s New York Yankees on Saturday night, when they hit six in a loss to the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThose Tigers are managed by Ron Gardenhire, who managed the Twins back when they had a much different reputation offensively. In 2006, for example, Gardenhire managed Minnesota to 96 victories and a division title. The Twins finished 28th in the majors in home runs that year.\n\nMinnesota was led by the pitching of Johan Santana and the all-around excellence of Joe Mauer. The Twins had power hitters like Justin Morneau and Torii Hunter, but they weren\u2019t a team you expected to outslug the Yankees and Red Sox.\n\n\u201cWhen I first took over as manager, we had speed,\u201d Gardenhire said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much power, but we had a lot of speed, so we ran all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe Twins haven\u2019t led the majors in home runs since 1964, and they haven\u2019t even finished in the top 10 since 1991, when they won the second of two World Series titles in five years.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s home run binge this year came after the Twins finished 23rd in the category a season ago. Yes, the Twins have Nelson Cruz - who has 34 homers this year and is closing in on 400 for his career - but this power surge was unexpected from this roster.\n\nQuick, name the other seven Minnesota players with 20 home runs. The answer is a few paragraphs below.\n\n\u201cGuys get hot and teams get hot for a game or a week, or a couple of weeks,\u201d Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cBut to do it for five straight months at that pace is - it\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nThe Twins have a chance to break up an AL East monopoly on the home run lead. The Yankees, Orioles and Blue Jays are the only teams to lead the majors over the past 10 years.\n\nThe Yankees are in second place now, a dozen homers behind Minnesota.\n\nElsewhere around the majors:\n\nHANGING IN\n\nThe Oakland Athletics are a half-game out of the second wild card in the American League - and that\u2019s after a 16-game stretch that included 10 against the Astros and Yankees. Oakland went 7-3 in those games against the AL\u2019s top two teams.\n\nThe A\u2019s play four more against Houston, but other than that, the schedule eases up in September. Oakland\u2019s other 22 remaining games are against the Angels, Tigers, Rangers, Royals and Mariners.\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER\n\nThe other seven Minnesota players with 20 homers, aside from Cruz, are: Max Kepler (36), Eddie Rosario (27), Mitch Garver (26), Miguel Sano (26), C.J. Cron (24), Jonathan Schoop (21) and Jorge Polanco (20).\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Yankees might have as many home runs as the Twins if Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge had played more than 90 games combined. Even so, New York has been getting homers from unexpected sources. Mike Ford, who went undrafted out of Princeton and made his big league debut in April at age 26, hit a game-winning homer Sunday against Oakland. That came a day after DJ LeMahieu beat the A\u2019s with a homer of his own.\n\nLINE OF THE WEEK\n\nJust when it seemed that no-hitters were becoming multipitcher affairs, Justin Verlander threw one all by himself Sunday in a 2-0 win at Toronto. The Houston right-hander became one of six players with at least three no-hitters. He struck out 14.\n\nHonorable mention: It wasn\u2019t the most effective outing - one run and two hits in one inning - but Carlos Carrasco\u2019s relief appearance for Cleveland on Sunday at Tampa Bay was a feel-good story for the Indians after he was diagnosed with leukemia earlier in the year. It was his first appearance for Cleveland since May.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's no surprise that someone set a home run record this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/twins_tigers_baseball_70911_c0-153-3660-2286_s1770x1032.jpg?71a01b4708145ea13074f98382a7e5c0e525b59a"}
