Thunberg\u2019s chosen form of protest\u2014a school strike\u2014is uncommon in the United States, though more popular in Europe. Americans think of school as something that chiefly benefits students, not society; comparing it to a job, where a labor stoppage is a recognized form of protest, is outside our ken. But if you come to see school as part of an intergenerational exchange of welfare\u2014students go to school now, so that in 30 years they can get jobs and pay Social Security taxes\u2014then it aligns well with Thunberg\u2019s overall point, which is that older generations have betrayed young people today by failing to address climate change. This almost economic argument has the virtue of being accurate.\n\nAnd when Thunberg talks about this, especially in private, she sounds a lot like \u2026 a teenager. \u201cWe are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair,\u201d she said at one point.\n\nAnd this is the way to understand Thunberg that paints her as neither a saint nor a demon but that still captures her appeal. Thunberg epitomizes, in a person, the unique moral position of being a teenager. She can see the world through an \u201cadult\u201d moral lens, and so she knows that the world is a heartbreakingly flawed place. But unlike an actual adult, she bears almost no conscious blame for this dismal state. Thunberg seems to gesture at this when referring to herself as a \u201cchild,\u201d which she does often in speeches.\n\nWhen I spoke with her, I asked whether she felt this dual position: the burden of awareness mixed with the lack of blame. \u201cYes, definitely,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we are so young, our perspective on the world, our perception of the world is so\u2014is so, like, blank. We don\u2019t have that much experience. We don\u2019t say, Oh, we cannot change this because it\u2019s always been this way, which a lot of old people say. We definitely need that new perspective to see the world.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that is why adults find her so unnerving. \u201cThis child\u2014and she is a child\u2014has been scared and her parents are letting her be controlled by that fear,\u201d writes the right-wing commentator Erick Erickson, who blames her parents for \u201cdepriving her of a sound education so she can lecture grownups.\u201d Jonathan Tobin, at The Federalist, worries that the shoe is on the other foot: Thunberg has \u201cforced her parents to adopt a vegan diet\u201d and \u201cbullied her mother to give up her career because it involved air travel.\u201d\n\nThese may seem like exaggerated concerns, but Erickson and Tobin are really just engaging in a great American tradition: In this country, even before we greet you, we ask whether you\u2019re being parented wrong.\n\nOther arguments against Thunberg\u2019s rhetoric can and should be made; if she wants to participate as an adult citizen, she should be criticized like one. But in The New York Times, the journalist Christopher Caldwell takes maybe the oddest line of all, claiming that Thunberg\u2019s message is antidemocratic. \u201cDemocracy often calls for waiting and seeing. Patience may be democracy\u2019s cardinal virtue,\u201d he wrote. \u201cClimate change is a serious issue. But to say, \u2018We can\u2019t wait,\u2019 is to invite a problem just as grave.\u201d", "description": "Especially in private, she sounds a lot like \u2026 a teenager.", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX749UU/facebook.jpg?1569267268", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
