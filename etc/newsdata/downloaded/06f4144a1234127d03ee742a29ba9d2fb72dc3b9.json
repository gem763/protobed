Just say yes or no.\n\n\"Thing is, I know it's got to be what I'm comfortable with but at the moment I'm not comfortable wearing it curly. Pretty long, eh?\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Does anyone care? No.\"\n\nEarlier in the story, Peter gave a glimpse at the curls within a more complete ensemble, as he rocked a sophisticated turtle neck and long coat on the red carpet.\n\nHe asked \"Shall I wear it naturally curly tonight?\" along with \"yes\" and \"no\" buttons.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe star was in a very lavish looking Monte Carlo hotel, along with a pal.\n\nPeter was married to former glamour model Katie Price - the couple called it quits in 2009, and had Junior, 14, and Princess, 12.\n\nHe also has five year-old Amelia and two year-old Theodore with his new wife, Emily MacDonagh. The pair got hitched back in 2015 in a lavish Exeter property.\n\nFans were left in hysterics when Peter managed to prank Princess into thinking he'd bought her an expensive pair of headphones.\n\n\"Dad!\" Princess shouted as she looked into the empty box, \"That is not funny!\"", "description": "Peter confided to his Instagram followers that he hadn't worn his hair curly for years because he was picked on as a kid", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660710.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Peter-Andre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
