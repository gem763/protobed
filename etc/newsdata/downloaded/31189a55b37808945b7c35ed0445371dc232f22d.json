EU member Ireland has a land border with the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and both want to keep that border invisible, for economic and peace treaty reasons. But once Britain leaves the bloc, that Irish border turns into an external EU border that the bloc wants to keep secure.\n\nBarnier said it\u2019s \u201chigh time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d He wants a clear answer by Wednesday morning to tell EU capitals what should be decided once the bloc\u2019s two-day summit kicks off on Thursday.\n\n\u201cEven if an agreement will be difficult \u2014 more and more difficult, we think \u2014 it is still possible this week,\u201d Barnier said.\n\nTo further boost the momentum, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss where more movement could be found.\n\nBritain is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31, and the EU summit this week was long considered one of the last possible chances to approve a divorce agreement to accommodate that deadline. Johnson insists his country will leave at the end of the month with or without a divorce deal, but British lawmakers have been adamant on avoiding a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who had a long, intense talk with Barnier early Tuesday, said the EU believes \u201cthis is difficult, but it is doable.\u201d He said Barnier addressed EU ministers and \u201cdid point to progress in the last number of days where the gaps have been narrowed.\u201d\n\nA senior German official wouldn\u2019t rule out a Brexit agreement in principle by Wednesday afternoon, but stressed the importance of time-consuming specifications.\n\n\u201cThe basis for our decisions are legal texts in which the details are settled,\u201d the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules, said in Berlin. \u201cBut there has been progress, and as always in these negotiations the biggest progress happens over the final meters.\u201d\n\nLate Monday, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the British proposals to keep the Irish border protected from smuggling and fraud once it leaves the bloc were insufficient.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. proposal contained some steps forward but not enough to guarantee that the internal market will be protected,\u201d Blok said.\n\nOne EU diplomat said for things to work, technical negotiators would need to finish their text and make it available by 10 a.m. Wednesday so European governments have time to assess them.\n\nEU ministers insisted it was time for Johnson to make the next move \u2014 and he seemed to be listening. Besides the call with Macron, Johnson shifted Britain\u2019s weekly Cabinet meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday so he could give his ministers a better idea of Brexit progress.\n\nIf talks fail or stumble ahead of the EU summit, there could always be an extraordinary meeting just ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit departure \u2014 or the Brexit deadline could be extended again.\n\n\u201cThere will be progress tomorrow, the question is how big this progress will be,\u201d the German official said. \u201cIs this progress so great that work is still needed, but this work can be done in the next few days? Or is the progress such that two more months\u2019 work is needed?\u201d\n\nBrexit negotiators, politicians and ordinary Europeans were all waiting for the answers to those questions.\n\n___\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LUXEMBOURG (AP) \u2014 A Brexit divorce deal is still possible ahead of Thursday's European Union summit but the British government needs to move ahead with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/777227_luxembourg-europe-brexit-04623-european-union-chief-brexit-negotiator-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
