Gee, which will likely be scheduled for oral arguments in early 2020, will be the first involving abortion for the court's new majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents, including President Donald Trump's two nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIt also comes amid a crush of state laws passed over the last two years aimed at sharply restricting -- or outright banning -- abortion, many with the express expectation that legal challenges may end up before the high court.\n\nRelated Video: Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Trump Immigration Policy\n\n(MORE: Supreme Court takes on gay rights, DACA and guns in new term )\n\nThe Louisiana law, signed in 2014, requires \"that every physician who performs or induces an abortion shall 'have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced.'\"\n\nAdmitting privileges allow a physician to practice medicine at a given hospital. Doctors are usually required to apply for the privileges and meet qualifications set forth by the facility. Critics of the Louisiana law say the requirement is costly, burdensome and likely to drive many abortion providers out of business, which in turn will severely limit women's access to the procedure.\n\nLouisiana only has three licensed abortion clinics. Supporters of the law say the state has the right to regulate the clinics to ensure safety.\n\n\"Abortion activists are more than willing to lower the bar on women's health in order to expand abortion, but stricter clinic regulations are in the best interest of women,\" said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in response to the Supreme Court's action.\n\n(MORE: Trump administration backs Vermont nurse who says she was forced to aid in abortion)\n\nIn February, the court granted one clinic's request for an emergency stay of the law while the case proceeds. The 5-4 decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined with members of the court's liberal wing, signaled the court's willingness to take up the case.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court rejected a similar law in Texas after a challenge from Whole Woman's Health, a health organization that provides abortions, that required doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and mandated that abortion clinics meet state requirements for licensed surgical centers. The majority, in a 5-3 decision, said the law created an \"undue burden\" on women seeking access to abortion.\n\n\"We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes,\" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the court's opinion. \"Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution.\"\n\nPHOTO: The United States Supreme Court Building in Washington D.C. is pictured in this undated stock photo. (STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images) More\n\nIn her concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that \"Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws\" like the Texas law that, quoting a previous abortion case, \"'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion' ... cannot survive judicial inspection.\"\n\n\"Today the court agreed to hear the Louisiana case challenging identical laws, modeled on Texas, after seeing nearly all of our clinics shuttered,\" Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, told ABC News Friday. \"We at Whole Woman\u2019s Health know, however, that the same laws will have the same effects in Louisiana that they did in Texas.\"\n\nThe 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recently ruled, however, that Louisiana's 2014 law is substantively different from the Texas measure and should be upheld because it does not \"impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women\" in the state. The Supreme Court will review that decision.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday added abortion rights to its docket for the new term, agreeing to hear a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.
