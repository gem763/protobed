There is overwhelming evidence proving his guilt. I want him prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\n#ElPasoStrong pic.twitter.com/9hyIEy2vnF\u2014 Mayor Dee Margo (@mayor_margo) October 10, 2019", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 The 21-year-old man accused of killing 22 people at a West Texas Walmart has pleaded not guilty.
