Photo: Kacper Pempel/Illustration/Reuters\n\nTwitter\u2019s (TWTR) profits in the UK surged last year as more advertisers flocked to the platform, but the company\u2019s tax bill fell due to an increase in share awards to employees.\n\nProfits at Twitter UK, the US social media company\u2019s British subsidiary, leapt by 800% to \u00a33.6m ($4.4m) in 2018, accounts filed with Companies House this week show.\n\nRevenue rose by 33% to \u00a3103.4m. Twitter said in its accounts that most revenues come from advertising on the platform.\n\nDespite the rise in profits and revenues, Twitter\u2019s UK tax bill fell from \u00a32.4m in 2017 to just \u00a3410,000 last year.\n\nThe decline was down to the use of deferred tax credits built up in prior years and a rise in share-based payments to staff. Share-based compensation at Twitter UK rose from \u00a37.9m to \u00a38.4m.\n\nEmployee share award schemes can give companies tax breaks if their public share price rises above the share price set in the scheme.\n\nStaff typically sign up to share award schemes that pay over time. The price of the shares available to staff is set at the start of the scheme and if the company\u2019s share price rises in the meantime, then the business is entitled to a tax break. This is because the company is notionally losing money by handing out the shares at the lower price.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

Both grant stock after four years to eligible employees.\n\nTwitter\u2019s share price rallied over 50% across 2018, helping to explain the discount. Accounts show share based payments reduced Twitter\u2019s UK tax bill by \u00a3881,000 last year, which would have wiped out the company\u2019s entire corporation tax bill if not for other adjustments.\n\nTwitter UK\u2019s accounts show headcount rose from 174 to 192 people last year and staffing costs rose from \u00a320.2m to \u00a323m.\n\nTwitter UK wrote that the business was progressing well but warned that Brexit could \u201cadversely impact\u201d the company due to potential \u201ceconomic and political uncertainty and complexity.\u201d\n\nTwitter was not immediately available for comment.\n\nEmployee share schemes are widely used by tech companies as a way to reward staff. Amazon\u2019s UK tax bill was adjusted down by \u00a317.5m last year due to share awards and Facebook\u2019s tax liability was reduced by \u00a36m in 2017 for the same reason.\n\nHowever, the relatively-small tax bills of tech giants in the UK has been a constant source of controversy. Earlier this month, Amazon was accused of paying \u201cdiddly squat\u201d tax in the UK last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOscar Williams-Grut covers banking, fintech, and finance for Yahoo Finance UK.
