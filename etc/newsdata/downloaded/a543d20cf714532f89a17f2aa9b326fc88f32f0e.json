Pictured: Daryl Braithwaite\n\nVocal: 'Is there anything more un-Australian than not showing us Daryl Braithwaite?' one football fan asked\n\n'Absolute disgrace that Channel Nine aren't showing Daryl Braithwaite at half-time. For God's sake - Horses is the second national anthem,' another posted.\n\nOne also asked rather bluntly: '#NRLGrandFinal why do you hate Daryl Braithwaite?'\n\nWhile Christine Anu, 49, and Natalie Bassingthwaighte, 44, had their NRL Grand Final half-time performances broadcast on Nine, Daryl's failed to make the cut.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Nine for comment.\n\nStrong words: Another said it's an 'absolute disgrace' for Nine to ditch Daryl, 70, from the TV broadcast\n\nIcon: Daryl delighted the crowd at Sydney's ANZ Stadium with his hit Horses\n\nThe decision to ditch Daryl from the TV broadcast comes after American pop band OneRepublic's lacklustre pre-game entertainment.\n\nAs the group chose to cover Beyonc\u00e9's 2008 hit Halo, viewers took to Twitter to criticise OneRepublic as well as Nine, for the odd song choice.\n\n'Really? A Queen Bey funeral song pre-game?' One viewer commented online.\n\nCriticism: Viewers also slammed NRL for their Grand Final pre-game entertainment on Twitter, as OneRepublic covered Beyonc\u00e9's 2008 hit Halo on Sunday night. Pictured: Ryan Tedder\n\nFuneral song: 'Really? A Queen Bey funeral song pre-game?' one viewer asked on Twitter\n\n'Why is Halo being sung as a cover at the NRL Grand Final?' another fan asked.\n\n'OneRepublic's screaming cover of Beyonc\u00e9's Halo, while the choir try to cover up how bad he's singing, was the perfect choice to get the crowd pumped up for the #NRLGF well done NRL,' one wrote.\n\nSome poked fun at the code's inability to secure Beyonc\u00e9 for pre-game entertainment, sharing: 'When the #nrl wants to book Beyonc\u00e9 but gets OneRepublic to perform Halo. Yuck.'\n\nHarsh critique: One viewer suggested the staff of NRL should be 'sacked'\n\nHowever it wasn't all negative, with select viewers praising OneRepublic for a stellar performance.\n\n'Unpopular opinion on the Twitter verse right now, but OneRepublic actually doing a bl**dy good job,' one wrote. 'Not liking their music isn't a reason to slam them. Music is subjective.'\n\nOneRepublic, comprising of lead vocalist Ryan Tedder, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, basisst and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher and keyboardist Brian Willett, took to the stage at Sydney's ANZ Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nThe band sung Beyonc\u00e9's Halo as well as their own hits, Counting Stars and Something I Need.\n\nHyped performance: OneRepublic, comprising of Ryan Tedder (pictured), Zach Filkins, Drew Brown, Brent Kutzle, Eddie Fisher and Brian Willett, took to the stage at Sydney's ANZ Stadium", "description": "Viewers slammed Nine for failing to broadcast Daryl Braithwaite's NRL Grand Final half-time performance on television screens.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19360376-0-image-a-37_1570363558160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
