But it\u2019s still not ready for most", "language": "en", "text": "Samsung's Galaxy Fold is no longer a $1 980 (R30 000) brick. Six months after launching a device with a strange screen protector and a tendency to crack, the South Korean-technology giant is back with a much-improved product. It\u2019s still not ready for most consumers, though.\n\n\n\nThe screen protector is now under a plastic rim so it\u2019s essentially impossible to remove. That should prevent the cracks that doomed the original Fold. There are also new caps at the top and bottom of the hinge to stop debris getting into the display. With the previous model, dust and other gunk sometimes caused the screen to bubble up and break. The hinge \u2013 the mechanism that lets users open and shut the phone \u2013 also seems slightly stronger.\n\nThe inner screen opens up to become a tablet about 7 inches (18cm) in size. There\u2019s also a 4-inch (10cm) outer screen that is mostly used for quickly replying to messages, and handling phone calls. The external screen works well for dialling numbers and accepting calls, but it\u2019s too cramped for most other tasks.\n\nThe larger screen inside, however, is compelling. Being able to have a tablet-sized screen in your pocket makes the Galaxy Fold one of the best smartphones for watching video. It\u2019s an excellent YouTube machine. You can also pin multiple apps on the screen at once, so it\u2019s easy to watch video, text and browse the web at the same time.\n\nThe operating system lets you slice up the screen in inventive and useful ways. One app can take up the whole of the left side of the screen, while another app takes up the top right area, with a third filling in the remaining bottom right of the display. You can also add several small \u201cpop up view\u201d apps that float around the screen, although this starts getting confusing and messy with more than three or four apps.\n\nThere are still drawbacks with the folding display, though. In very bright environments, it\u2019s harder to see. And the crease that runs down the centre of the screen shows up when you\u2019re viewing something dark. And one issue from the first model remains: The screen can pick up dents from fingernails. Over several months or a year of use, that\u2019s likely to bother customers. Samsung has said this is an inherent characteristic of its foldable phone design and offers a $149.99 (R2290) screen replacement within the first year.", "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Fold is no longer a $1,980 brick.
