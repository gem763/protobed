Which had to have felt good!\n\nMeghan's close friend and rumored stylist Jessica Mulroney shared the open letter on Twitter, and guess who hopped into the replies? That'd be Joanne Vitiello, the mother of Meghan's ex-boyfriend, Chef Cory Vitiello.\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted, but according to Meghan fan accounts like @duchess_of_sussex, Cory's mom wrote \"It's about time! (So sad and shocking that there\u2019s so much jealousy, hostility and bullying directed her way!).\u201d\n\n^Swipe for the tweet!\n\nMeghan and Cory dated between 2014 and 2016 and Joanne previously told The Daily Mail that \"we are very fond of her ... she is a lovely, lovely woman. Very smart, very bright, very caring. She's a warm personality, very sincere. We very much enjoyed the time we spent with her. She fitted very well into our family. The Royal Family, and Britain, is very lucky to have her.\"\n\nIt's honestly wonderful that someone from Meghan's past is being so supportive (wish I could say the same about her own family, ahem!), and again\u2014this letter from the MPs is pretty amazing. Read it in full right here:\n\nWomen MPs from all political parties have put aside our differences to stand in solidarity with the Duchess of Sussex today and are sending her this open letter. pic.twitter.com/ytLHG5qPf4 \u2014 Holly Lynch MP (@HollyLynch5) October 29, 2019\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This is the sweetest.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7yxrRzD5qnlzUkx3fqE3QA--~B/aD0xMTIyO3c9MjI0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/28df489eff060e940c2ed32e5a03ed1d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
