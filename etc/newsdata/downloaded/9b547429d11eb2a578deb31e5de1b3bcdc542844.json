It is also outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition,\u201d the letter reads. It was co-signed by eight members of Congress, including Republican Senators Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse, as well as House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). Senator Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Representatives Jim Banks (R., In.), Mike Gallagher (R., Wis.), and Tom Malinowski (D., N.J.) also joined in on the letter.\n\nThe co-signers criticize Silver and the NBA for not anticipating \u201cthe challenged of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government\u201d and for not standing up for Morey.\n\n\u201cHundreds of millions of people within China will read your statements as an admission that their government\u2019s propaganda is correct; millions of people in Hong Kong will be dispirited,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThat you have more potential fans in China than in Hong Kong is no excuse for being over backwards to express \u2018sensitivity\u2019 only to one side.\u201d\n\nThe NBA released an initial statement Sunday night which called the situation \u201cregrettable,\u201d while the league\u2019s China social media count stated it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments that \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said on Monday that there should not have been a discrepancy. On Tuesday, Adam Silver seemed to defend Morey in a press conference, saying \u201cwe will have to live with those consequences\u201d stemming from his original tweet. Chinese league sponsors have responded by suspending or severing ties with the NBA.\n\nThe letter from Congress concludes by asking Silver to take a number of steps, including a suspension of NBA activities in China until government-backed Chinese firms end their \u201cselective treatment\u201d of the Houston Rockets, as well as affirming internally \u201cthat public commentary on international human rights repression . . . falls within expected standards of public behavior and expression.\u201d", "description": "A bipartisan coalition of members of Congress sent a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Wednesday \u201cto express our deep concern\u201d over the NBA\u2019s statements surrounding the controversy over a tweet expressing support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "John Fund", "Kevin D.
