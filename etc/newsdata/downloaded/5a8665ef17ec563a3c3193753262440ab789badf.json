They heat it in vast copper cauldrons then curdle it with an enzyme found in cow stomachs.\n\nThe curdled milk sinks to the bottom of the enormous vats, and after it has clumped together into a firm mass it is hoisted out with cheesecloths, and shaped into the drum-like form that makes Parmigiano-Reggiano so recognizable.\n\nEach cheese wheel is later dipped in a salt solution to harden its external crust and is imprinted with the letters D.O.P.\n\nThe letters are an acronym for the Italian phrase \"denominazioni d'origine protette,\" which translates as \"protected designation of origin.\" This is an EU labeling device intended to guarantee the authenticity of a product's geographical origins and to protect local producers to guard against cheaper replicas.\n\nOf all the registered protected designation products in the EU, Italy holds a quarter of them, a move that continues to anger dairy competitors in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. National Milk Producers Federation earlier this month called it a \"particularly egregious example of EU trade practices\" and said the bloc was \"abusing the use of geographical indications to limit competition from cheese exporters in the U.S. that use common food names.\"\n\nCase in point: parmesan, or as the Italians insist their product should be referred to, Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n\n\"We want to tell American citizens that when they eat 'parmesan' they are eating a fake,\" the Italian Minister for Agriculture Theresa Bellanova told CNBC. \"That is identity theft of our original products, and we cannot accept it.\"\n\nItaly has more than doubled its global cheese exports in the past decade, and now ships around $3.3 billion worth of cheese overseas each year, with Parmigiano-Reggiano the fastest-growing source of export revenue.\n\nAround half a billion dollars worth of Italian exports each year, much of it cheese, will now face American tariffs. The Parmigiano-Reggiano Consortium, which has overseen quality control for the cheese's production since 1934, estimates U.S. importers will have to pay around $200 more for each Parmigiano-Reggiano wheel, and producers say they expect sales volumes across the Atlantic will consequently crumble.\n\n\"The U.S. is the second-most important market for us overseas,\" says Fabrizio Raimondi, the consortium's external relations director. He and the consortium's president, Nicola Bertinelli, are convinced that harder cheeses like theirs have been targeted to allow American imitation \"parmesan\" cheese to seize market share.\n\nAnd Italian producers may have good reason to be slighted, since their government did not participate in the multinational consortium behind Airbus, unlike Germany, Spain, France and the U.K, which all now face tariffs on their own products, ranging from wine to whiskey, aircraft to olives.\n\n\"Of course we are not happy,\" Italy's new finance chief, Roberto Gualtieri, told CNBC when asked whether he felt it reasonable that other nations' previous subsidies to Airbus might lead to American punishment of Italian producers. \"It would be totally unfair to target Italian exports for an issue, by the way, about which Italy is not responsible at all.\"", "description": "Food producers across Europe are bracing for a financial hit from U.S. tariffs that take effect Friday, and Italy, which has more than doubled its global cheese exports in the past decade, believes it is being unfairly targeted.", "authors": ["Willem Marx"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106190337-1571421032137gettyimages-1154670227r.jpg?v=1571406699", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
