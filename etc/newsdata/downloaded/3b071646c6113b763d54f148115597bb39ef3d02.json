These are busy times when cooking has no time allocated. Eating out becomes an easy option. Even healthcare workers are obese and overweight. The situation is so bad.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest SA Demographic and Health Survey, almost 70% of local women are either overweight or obese. The country has the highest rates for women in Africa.\n\n\u201cExcess body weight is a massive problem, but not only in adults; 13% of South African children are overweight or obese which is more than double the global average of five percent,\u201d said one of the study co-authors Professor Alta Schutte, from the South African Medical Research Council.\n\nSchutte said: \u201cWe need to seriously look in the mirror and change the lifestyles we lead in order to safeguard the health of South Africans, especially for future generations who are already being negatively affected.\u201d According to her, healthy lifestyles should be incentivised and prioritised by governments which should subsidise healthy foods.\n\nEthno-specific methods needed\n\nAnother South African study released in 2016 called for modifications to the country\u2019s healthcare system to include ethno-specific strategies to target non-communicable health risks that the Indian community suffers.\n\nThe study, led by the Department of Food and Nutrition Consumer Studies at the Durban University of Technology, also expressed the need for a redesign of current educational awareness programmes to spread \u201ccorrect\u201d information about the health of Indians.\n\nThe study said their findings fell in line with global research about the health of \u201cmigrant\u201d Indians, who generally report higher prevalences of diabetes, heart disease and hypertension than \u201cindigenous groups\u201d.\n\nSome 250 randomly selected and \u201capparently healthy\u201d Indians from the KwaDukuza area of KwaZulu-Natal aged 35-55 were selected as participants.\n\nResearchers made efforts to ensure that participants who were previously diagnosed with hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes were excluded. Chemical tests, such as blood samples and cholesterol checks, were administered.\n\nThe central findings of the report were that \u201clarge percentages\u201d of participants showed \u201ctypical\u201d signs of metabolic syndrome.\n\nThey were \u201ccentrally obese\u201d (fat around the middle) and had high cholesterol and glucose.\n\nThe study then recommended a specialised approach targeted specifically at Indian people, which would see weight reduction as the cornerstone for reducing these \u201cmetabolic abnormalities\u201d.\n\nAbdominal fat was also an indicator of chronic heart disease and hypertension, it said.\n\nSA in a \u2018metabolic crisis\u2019\n\nLocal dietician Claire Barnard from Project Health in Hilton said South Africa is a nation that is in a metabolic crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have for so long looked at weight as a predictor of health, but what we need to realise is that health is physical, mental, emotional and environmental ... Due to South Africa being a third world country, our basic needs are not always met, therefore leading to an unhealthy nation,\u201d said Barnard.\n\nOutlining some of the most dangerous factors which are the highest contributors making South Africans unhealthy, Barnard highlighted our stress levels as being too high.\n\nHere are a few tips from Barnard on keeping healthy. Focus on:\n\n1. Weekly or two weekly trips to the shop, and try not to rely on daily trips to the shop, as this increases expenditure.\n\n2. Plant a vegetable garden.\n\n3. Aim to make a complete meal for supper that includes a lean protein most nights (chicken/fish/lean beef/eggs/pork) that is the size of your palm, half a plate of carbohydrate-free vegetables/salad (anything except butternut, peas, sweet potatoes and corn), and less than a fist size of starch.\n\n4. Use your leftovers from supper for lunch the next day as this will include a good vegetable intake from the night before.\n\n5. Aim to incorporate exercise daily. This can include taking the stairs or taking a walk on your lunch break.\n\n6. If you have means to screen yourself metabolically try to do so yearly. Get your blood pressure, insulin levels, vitamin D and cholesterol profile checked on an annual basis.\n\n7.
