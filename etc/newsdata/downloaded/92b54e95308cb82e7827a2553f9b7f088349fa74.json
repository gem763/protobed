[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nA long-table banquet was served on Oct 26 to celebrate a harvest festival in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture in China's Southwest Guizhou province.\n\nTens of thousands of Miao villagers and tourists attended the 3.5 km-long table banquet served by the Miao people.\n\nThe event is acclaimed as the world's longest grand table banquet, where the Miao people's unique \"high mountain and flowing water\" toast, 18 bars of beverages and other special traditional customs are presented.\n\nTourists followed the lead of well-dressed young Miao people as they sang and danced.\n\nEach year after the autumn harvest, Miao villagers in Guizhou choose a day to celebrate their harvest festival, which is also called the New Crop Tasting Festival. It is the liveliest festival of the year.\n\nThe harvest festival of Danzhaiin has been selected for inclusion on Guizhou's provincial intangible cultural heritage list.\n\nMany new features were introduced at the traditional ceremony this year. For example, this marked the first time a boat feast was held on East Lake. While tourists were boating on the lake and enjoying the beautiful scenery, they could taste festival food.\n\nIn addition to the beverage bar toast to show the hospitality of the Danzhai people, this year's festival had some new programs, like the high mountain and flowing water fancy toast to demonstrate the Miao people's etiquette. Other highlights included the welcome dance, a Miao sacrifice ceremony, the grand parade of eight Miao branches and other ethnic minority activities.\n\nWang Jin contributed to this story.", "description": "A long-table banquet was served on Oct 26 to celebrate a harvest festival in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture in China's Southwest Guizhou province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db7d30da310cf3e97a362f0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
