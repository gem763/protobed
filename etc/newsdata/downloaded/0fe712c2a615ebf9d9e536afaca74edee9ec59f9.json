Their talking heads won\u2019t shut up long enough for that to happen, for one thing. They\u2019re going to continue going on and on about the evils of the Second Amendment and how we simply have to \u201cdo something.\u201d\n\nHowever, they held an online poll to find out what people thought about citizens carrying firearms.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty likely they figured the results would be split to some degree, but considering the average MSNBC viewer, they also probably thought it would come down on the side of gun control.\n\nThey were spectacularly wrong.\n\nProgressive cable news channel MSNBC posted an online poll to try to measure support for gun control, but they were likely disappointed with the overwhelming result. The poll showed that 93 percent of respondents supported the right of citizens to carry guns in public. Only 4 percent who responded to the decidedly unscientific poll said they were opposed to people carrying guns in public. Another 2 percent responded that people should be allowed to carry guns in public, but only for self defense.\n\nNow, it should be noted that this isn\u2019t a scientific poll and shouldn\u2019t be used for debate purposes. We all know how these things go. Someone like MSNBC posts the poll, pro-gun and anti-gun people rally their forces to go and vote on the poll and try to sway the results their way.\n\nYou also get a number of people who are just there and answer honestly.\n\nWhat you usually don\u2019t find, though, is something this lopsided.\n\nOf course, the question wouldn\u2019t withstand scrutiny from a professional pollster, either. After all, what\u2019s the context? It doesn\u2019t differentiate between the rules surrounding such carry, such as those found in a constitutional carry state versus a very restrictive state like California\u2019s. It\u2019s just people\u2019s off-the-cuff response to the question.\n\nAnd as of this morning, with over 700.000 votes in, it remains at 93 percent supporting the right to bear arms in public.\n\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t actually mean all that much. Even many anti-gunners seem to believe that there\u2019s some right to keep and bear arms, so it stands to reason that some will say there\u2019s a right to carry a gun in public\u2026for some people. After all, they don\u2019t expect celebrities or officials to not have the means to defend themselves.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s possible the only reason there were 700K votes on this puppy is because pro-gunners flock to polls like this almost like they would one offering free ammo and anti-gunners just aren\u2019t that interested in the topic.\n\nThat would shock me, though, since so much of their time and effort has been built up into portraying their position as the mainstream position while claiming folks like me are radicals for not wanting to give up freedom in the name of some illusory safety. One would think they\u2019d love a poll like this as a way to show just how significant their numbers are.\n\nThen again, maybe they didn\u2019t simply because they can\u2019t.", "description": "The liberal cable news network probably thought they'd find a nice bit of evidence to suggest the Second Amendment's days were numbered.
