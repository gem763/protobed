REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nIn a letter to Warner Bros, the families of some of the victims also urged the company to end any political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and to fund gun violence intervention programs.\n\nThe letter does not ask for the movie to be withdrawn. But it says, \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d\n\nThe letter, seen by Variety and other Hollywood industry outlets, comes before \u201cJoker,\u201d starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Batman comic book villain, opens in U.S. movie theaters on Oct. 4.\n\nThe movie won the top award at the Venice film festival in September and has won plaudits for its disturbing depiction of a social outcast who wreaks terrifying violence. Box office analysts expect it to take about $70 million-$80 million at the North American box office on its opening weekend.\n\nWarner Bros said on Tuesday that it had a long history of donating to victims of violence, including those in the Colorado shooting. The movie studio added in a statement that its parent, telecommunications company AT&T Inc, had recently joined other business leaders in calling for legislation to address the issue of mass shootings in the United Sates.\n\n\u201cNeither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,\u201d the statement added.\n\nTwelve people were killed and 70 were wounded in 2012 during a midnight movie theater showing of \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d also about the Joker character, in Aurora, Colorado, by a lone gunman who is now serving multiple life sentences.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned that Warner Bros was releasing a movie called \u2018Joker\u2019 that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,\u201d said the letter, dated Sept. 23 and signed by five men and women.\n\nOne of those signatories, Sandy Phillips, told the Hollywood Reporter in an interview that he feared that even one person who is \u201con the edge, who is wanting to be a mass shooter, may be encouraged by this movie. And that terrifies me.\u201d\n\nPhoenix and \u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips have defended the film against suggestions that it may encourage violence.\n\n\u201cI think we all are aware of these issues and we\u2019re concerned, and I think that\u2019s why we talk about it. I don\u2019t think that we can be afraid to talk about it,\u201d Phoenix told entertainment website IGN in an interview earlier this week.", "description": "Families involved in a 2012 movie theater mass shooting in Colorado have asked the studio behind \"Joker\" to help lobby for gun reform, expressing concern about the film's portrait of a mental breakdown that leads to violence.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433472577&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1WZ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
