No specific reason was given but if you\u2019ve followed this story, you know the issue was allegations of anti-Semitism. At the same time, the group announced it was adding a bunch of new people to the board including Zahra Billoo, executive director of the San Francisco chapter of CAIR. You can see her on the bottom right in this tweet:\n\nWe\u2019ve cultivated the leadership of grassroots organizers across the country to make Women\u2019s March a leaderful movement, and now we\u2019re growing. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to announce our new board who will continue moving Women\u2019s March forward. https://t.co/WYvXyqBUhT pic.twitter.com/6yDFK5anuj \u2014 Women's March (@womensmarch) September 16, 2019\n\nEarlier today, just three days after her appointment to the board was announced, Women\u2019s March said Billoo had been removed from the board effective immediately:\n\nZahra Billoo has been removed from board membership effective immediately. We found some of her public statements incompatible with the values and mission of the organization. Women's March will continue to build an inclusive and effective movement that holds space for all women. \u2014 Women's March (@womensmarch) September 19, 2019\n\nWhich statements? And how were they incompatible? Women\u2019s March doesn\u2019t say, but once again, the unspoken issue is anti-Semitism. Tuesday, Forward published a piece titled \u201cThe Women\u2019s March Finally Dumped Linda Sarsour \u2013 And Replaced Her With Someone Worse.\u201d That piece highlighted several of Billoo\u2019s past tweets about Israel which seem pretty far over the line of legitimate criticism, especially this one from 2012:\n\nApartheid Israel kills children as a hobby. \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) June 23, 2012\n\nWho has killed, tortured, and imprisoned more people: Apartheid Israel or ISIS? pic.twitter.com/y94rDyqV6i \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 6, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that Billoo hasn\u2019t deleted these tweets even after this announcement she has been dumped. I wonder if she was given a chance to apologize and simply decided she was unwilling to do so. Either way, she\u2019s doesn\u2019t appear to feel any regret about these comments.\n\nGiven that allegations of anti-Semitism were behind the shake-up in the first place, you would think that Women\u2019s March would have taken extra care to avoid selecting anti-Semites as its new board members. Somehow that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBeyond the obvious failure to vet its new board, there\u2019s also the broader question of why Women\u2019s March won\u2019t say plainly discuss the problem. At least Justin Trudeau said racism is wrong when apologizing for appearing in blackface. Women\u2019s March seems to think a vague reference to unidentified statements should be good enough.\n\nUpdate: I missed this response by Billoo to her dismissal from yesterday.\n\nA few hours ago, I was voted off the @WomensMarch national board. 2/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThe past 48 hours have been a spiral of bad news and smear efforts. Part of the smear campaign is motivated by opponents of the Women\u2019s March, because the organization has traditionally challenged the status quo of power and white supremacy in our country. 4/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThe Women's March, Inc. is an organization I once held dear. 6/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nDuring the past few years right-wingers, from the President\u2019s son to the Anti-Defamation League and troll armies, have targeted the Women's March, Inc. For so long, I\u2019ve admired their resilience in speaking truth to power, in working together, and in never cowering. 8/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThe Women's March, Inc. that voted me off its board tonight is one that no longer demonstrates the strength that inspired millions of women across the country. 10/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a lost seat, there will be many seats. The Women's March, Inc. has drawn a line in the sand, one that will exclude many with my lived experiences and critiques. It has effectively said, we will work on some women\u2019s rights at the expense of others. 12/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nI condemn any form of bigotry unequivocally, but I also refuse to be silent as allegations of bigotry are weaponized against the most marginalized people, those who find sanctuary and hope in the articulation of truth. 14/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s why she didn\u2019t delete her old tweets:\n\nI told the truth as my community and I have lived it, through the FBI\u2019s targeting of my community, as I supported families who have lost loved ones because of US military actions, and as I learned from the horrific experiences of Palestinian life. 16/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThese efforts were rejected. And in rejecting these efforts, the new Women\u2019s March, Inc. board demonstrated that it lacks the courage to demonstrate allyship in the face of fire. 18/ \u2014 Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) September 19, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s more but you get the gist. She\u2019s trashing Women\u2019s March for failing to stand up to her.", "description": "\"...some of her public statements incompatible with the values and mission of the organization.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/womens-march-board.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
