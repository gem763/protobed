Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) for a third-party presidential bid.\n\nClinton sparked a multi-day controversy last week when she said on a podcast that Gabbard is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and that former Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein is a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d suggesting they could both be involved in helping Russia tilt the election for Trump. Clinton did not offer any proof at the time to back up her claims.\n\nGabbard quickly hit back on Twitter, labeling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d while asserting the former secretary of state\u2019s attacks were part of a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to sully Gabbard\u2019s reputation.\n\nHaving defended both Stein and Gabbard earlier in the day while speaking to reporters at a Cabinet meeting, insisting \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong\u201d and \u201csick\u201d with Clinton, Trump picked right up on that theme during his Hannity interview.\n\nComplaining about former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference, the president quickly pivoted to complaints about Clinton\u2019s attacks on Gabbard and Stein.\n\n\u201cJust like she did with Tulsi Gabbard,\u201d Trump grumbled. \u201cJust like she did with Jill Stein. She said, \u2018Jill Stein is a Russian asset.\u2019\u201d\n\nClaiming he didn\u2019t know either Stein or Gabbard\u2014even though Gabbard met with him shortly after his election to defend Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2014Trump went on to say that neither of them are Russian assets before revisiting his Cabinet remarks about Clinton and her defenders.\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\u201d he declared. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Trump circled back to the topic. Grousing once again that the Russia investigation was a \u201cphony scam,\u201d the president found a way to also make it about Clinton\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cAnd then you have Hillary Clinton saying, two days ago, Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset,\u201d Trump exclaimed. \u201cAnd that Jill Stein is a Russian agent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Wait a minute, it took me two and a half years,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI wish you would have said that earlier because people would have realized she\u2019s crazy, she\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
