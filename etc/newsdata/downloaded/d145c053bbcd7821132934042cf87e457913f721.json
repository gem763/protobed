(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCanada\u2019s federal election campaign wasn\u2019t 48 hours old, and the candidates were already trying to smear a rival, by comparing him to a politician who won\u2019t appear anywhere near the ballot next month.\n\nThe venue was the campaign\u2019s first debate, this month in Toronto. The punching bag was Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May told Scheer she had reviewed his foreign policy proposals and drawn a conclusion: \u201cIf anyone wants to know where you stand, just figure out what Trump wants.\u201d\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh piled on, saying Scheer \u201cseems to be willing to do whatever it takes to support and continue Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nPolls show President Trump is deeply unpopular in Canada, a long-standing U.S. ally on which he has imposed tariffs and whose prime minister he has called \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdishonest.\u201d But as leader of Canada\u2019s closest security partner and biggest trading partner, Trump remains an important figure here. And Canada has been asking the United States for help in getting China to free two Canadians being held there. All this means Trump could play an unusual role in the federal election campaign.\n\nParty leaders here are unlikely to alienate voters if they criticize the president; a man at a town hall in British Columbia this year offered to buy Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a beer if he would \u201cjust push him off a cliff.\u201d (The Liberal Party leader declined, saying Canadians shouldn\u2019t stoop to \u201cinsults and jokes.\u201d)\n\nBut candidates must also tread lightly: Trump is seen as an easy target; spending too much time on him could backfire as cheap politicking at the expense of more substantive campaigning. And the eventual winner will have to work with him.\n\n\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh take part in a Toronto debate last week. Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, skipped the event. (Pool/Reuters)\n\nThere\u2019s an extra challenge for Scheer and the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really want to align themselves with a far-right, reactionary or hard-line approach that they see coming out of the United States, but they still want to be Conservatives,\u201d said Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center. \u201cTo be too closely aligned to the values and beliefs of the current White House incumbent would be dangerous for any Canadian.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, locked in a tight race with Scheer, has cast himself periodically as a liberal foil to Trump, and has tried to tie his conservative rivals to the president and his policies. But he is careful in how he does so, rarely mentioning the president by name.\n\n[Trudeau launches Canada\u2019s election season dogged by scandal, Scheer]\n\nThe day after Trump issued his 2017 executive order banning entry to refugees and visitors from seven countries with Muslim majorities, Trudeau posted a tweet widely seen as a dig: \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d\n\nAfter a gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in March, Trudeau said some of the blame should fall to politicians who \u201croutinely fail to denounce this hatred\u201d and who \u201cactively court those who spread it.\u201d\n\nIn a notable shift, though, the Liberal Party released an ad over the weekend naming Trump and using his image. Narrated by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, it opens with a video of Trump and Trudeau shaking hands at the White House in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhen it was time to push for a better NAFTA deal, your Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect your jobs,\u201d Freeland says. \u201cWe stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrudeau greets supporters in Windsor, Ontario, on Monday. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press/AP)\n\nIs Trudeau trying to provoke an attack from the Oval Office?\n\nPollster Nik Nanos said it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a \u201ckiss of death\u201d for Trudeau, given the president\u2019s unpopularity among Canadians.\n\nAfter Trump called the prime minister dishonest and weak last year, Trudeau\u2019s political foes rallied to his side. Lawmakers unanimously adopted a motion in Parliament rejecting \u201cdisparaging ad hominem statements by U.S. officials.\u201d Even the populist premier of Ontario, Doug Ford \u2014 far from a Trudeau enthusiast \u2014 rose to the prime minister\u2019s defense, saying he stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder with the prime minister.\u201d\n\nDoes Trump plan to weigh in on the election? The State Department referred questions to the White House. The White House declined to comment. The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond.\n\n[Trudeau is down in the polls. Can Conservatives take advantage?]\n\nIf Trump would prefer a Scheer victory, he might do better to stay out of the election. May, the Green Party leader, spoke of the president\u2019s rallying effect.\n\n\u201cNothing makes me feel like a loyal Canadian who will stand up for a Canadian prime minister of any stripe like the idea of Donald Trump attacking them,\u201d she told The Washington Post.\n\nA Liberal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said Trudeau views the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 it has become the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, awaiting ratification by both Parliament and Congress \u2014 as a key accomplishment and will bring it up often because he doesn\u2019t believe the Conservatives would have achieved a better deal.\n\n\n\nScheer acknowledges a supporter in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press/AP)\n\nDuring the first debate, Scheer accused Trudeau of making \u201cconcession after concession after concession to Donald Trump without getting any wins back for Canada.\u201d (Trudeau did not attend the debate.)\n\nBut Scheer has been careful in his criticism of the president.\n\nAfter Trump said four minority Democratic congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from, Scheer condemned the \u201cdivisive comments\u201d \u2014 but like Trudeau, he stopped short of calling them racist.\n\n\u201cThey should be able to advocate for their own ideas without having their background or their personal identity or where their family might come from questioned in any way,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nSuch comments have left both Scheer and Trudeau open to criticism from the left for not being tough enough on Trump.\n\nDuring the debate, Singh attacked both leaders for failing to condemn more forcefully the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and use of child detention facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cTo not call that out for the shameful act that it is shows weakness,\u201d Singh said.\n\nTrudeau and Scheer are the likeliest candidates to become prime minister and thus to have to work with Trump after the election. Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history at the University of Toronto, called the task of trying to figure out how to talk about him on the campaign trail unenviable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like tiptoeing around a dragon and hoping the beast doesn\u2019t wake up,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrudeau is admonished a second time for conflicts of interest\n\nConservative wave could threaten Trudeau\n\nMonths before Canada\u2019s election, Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The U.S. president, who has called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdishonest,\u201d could be a factor in the Oct. 21 vote.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9iKTfMNRS6xq879j-3PKFNv9mCo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWDN3WZNUI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
