Plus a service charge. That was approximately the cost of our return airfare to Rome'\n\nCarlo Cafarotti, head of tourism for the city, railed against the restaurants action, telling the Times: 'Customers must be treated well and encourage to come back.'\n\n'With this kind of behaviour we are damaging the image of the capital.'\n\n", "description": "The Antico Caffe di Marte  restaurant in Rome which came under fire for the expensive prices it charged tourists has threatened to sue complaining customers.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/12/19011996-0-image-a-6_1570275729341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
