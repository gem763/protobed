That's my mission, that's what President Trump certainly wants me to work to achieve and I hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it that way,\" Pompeo told reporters.\n\nHe did not provide details about the coalition. The United States has however been trying to create a global maritime security alliance since attacks on oil tankers in Gulf waters, which Washington also blamed on Iran.\n\nUAE, Saudi Arabia, Britain and Bahrain have said they will participate. Iraq said it would not join, and most European countries have been reluctant to sign up for fear of stoking regional tensions.\n\nPompeo described his proposed coalition as \"an act of diplomacy\" while Iran's foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, told CNN on Thursday that the Islamic Republic \"won't blink\" if it has to defend itself against any U.S. or Saudi military strike, which he said would lead to \"all-out war\".\n\nLater on Friday, Zarif called Kuwait's foreign minister Sheikh Sabah al Khalid Al Sabah where the two discussed measures to de-escalate tensions in the region, state news agency KUNA reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n'B TEAM'\n\nZarif mocked Pompeo, saying he was part of a so-called \"B-team\", along with Saudi Arabia's crown prince, which is trying to dupe Trump into opting for war.\n\nPompeo on Wednesday met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has called the assault on oil plants a \"test of global will\".\n\nRiyadh has displayed what it described as remnants of 25 Iranian drones and missiles used in the strike, saying it was evidence of Iranian aggression.\n\nSaudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an \"extension of the Iranian regime's hostile and outlawed behaviour\" and called on the international community to \"shoulder its responsibilities and take a firm stance towards Iran's criminal behaviour.\"\n\n\"Complacency with the Iranian regime will only encourage it to commit more acts of terrorism and sabotage in our region and around the world,\" Jubeir tweeted.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged all countries in the Gulf to sit down for talks to defuse tensions and said groundless accusations against Iran over the attacks were inflaming tensions, Interfax news agency reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nOil prices, which soared following the attack, steadied after Saudi Arabia pledged to restore full oil production by the end of September. [O/R]\n\nYemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which is battling a Saudi-led military coalition, claimed responsibility for the assault on two Saudi oil plants, including the world's largest processing facility. U.S. and Saudi officials rejected the claim, saying the attack had not come from the south.\n\nSaudi-led forces launched a military operation north of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah on Friday, saying it had destroyed four sites used in assembling remote-controlled boats and sea mines to help protect the freedom of maritime navigation.\n\nU.N. MEETING IN FOCUS\n\nProof of Iranian responsibility for the Saudi attacks could provoke a response from Riyadh and Washington, which want to curb Iranian influence in the region.\n\nPompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week's annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Riyadh could make its case there.", "description": "The United States said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.
