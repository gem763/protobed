blocking the UK from leaving without a deal on Halloween .\n\nIn a series of phone calls, the Prime Minister told EU Council President Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel there should be no delay - despite Mr Johnson being forced to send a letter asking for a three-month extension.\n\nEU ambassadors met tonight with the French said to be pushing for a shorter extension of just two weeks.\n\nIf President Emmanuel Macron stands firm it could trigger an emergency summit of EU leaders, though that is thought unlikely.\n\nDiplomats are due to meet again on Friday, when Downing Street expects a decision.\n\nNo10 insiders predict Brussels will grant the three-month request but offer a \u201cflextension\u201d - meaning the UK can quit the bloc if and when a deal passes through Parliament before the cut-off.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said its steering group believed a \u201cflextension, not going beyond January 31, is the only way forward\u201d.\n\nA long delay would pave the way for a general election , which Labour has claimed it would back once the threat of a no-deal exit had been removed.\n\nOpposition parties signalled they will back a poll this autumn if the EU grants an extension until next year.\n\nThe No10 source insisted an election before Christmas was possible, despite officials saying the latest a ballot could be held was December 12 - meaning a poll must be triggered by November 7.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said Parliament\u2019s failure to break the deadlock means \u201cwe are left with the option of a general election\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThat seems to me to be the only way to break this impasse.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn has repeatedly said he wants an election once the no-deal threat has been removed.\n\nHis spokesman said: \u201cWe will support an election as soon as the risk of a no-deal crash-out is taken off the table.\n\n\u201cWhat that means will depend on the exact terms of the EU.\u201d\n\nHowever, Labour fears that if the EU grants an extension to January 31 and Mr Corbyn\u2019s party then backs an election, Downing Street could delay a ballot until after the deadline - meaning Britain could quit without a deal in February.\n\nShadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon insisted Labour would stick to its commitment to trigger a ballot once the threat of departing without a pact was removed.\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cAs soon as no-deal is off the table we want a general election to get the Tories out.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the business of leaving the Conservatives in power.\u201d\n\nA senior Lib Dem source said the party was \u201cnot scared\u201d of a general election, adding: \u201cOur priority remains getting a People\u2019s Vote, but we are not scared of a general election.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson was boosted on Tuesday night when his Withdrawal Agreement Bill cleared its first Commons hurdle.\n\nBut he suffered a hammer blow minutes later when the legislation\u2019s timetable was derailed as MPs demanded more time for scrutiny.\n\nHe immediately halted the Bill, unleashing further Brexit turmoil.\n\nDowning Street claimed it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d possible for the UK to quit the EU as planned with a deal on Halloween.\n\nA No10 source said: \u201cThe time now is to get it done, the PM wants to get it done by October 31.\n\n\u201cWe continue to wait to see what the EU will say.\u201d\n\nBut the chance of leaving on Halloween looks remote.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Budget scheduled for November could be axed if the UK remains in the bloc - thwarting Chancellor Sajid Javid \u2019s hopes of unveiling his first Budget with the UK having left the EU with a deal.\n\nMr Corbyn threw the PM a potential lifeline over the timetable of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, offering to help schedule its journey - but not in time for the UK could leave a week today(THU).\n\nIt is understood Labour believes the process could take fewer than 28 days - potentially meaning Brexit before Christmas.\n\nNegotiations between the PM and Mr Corbyn aimed at thrashing out a new timetable collapsed without agreement yesterday(WEDS).\n\nA No10 source insisted: \u201cI would not expect any more talks.\u201d\n\nBut the Labour leader\u2019s spokesman described the meeting in the PM\u2019s Commons office as \u201cperfectly cordial\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn stood \u201cready to work together with the Government on finding a reasonable and sensible way of getting the business done on with Withdrawal Agreement Bill in a reasonable time\u201d, he added.\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar backed extending the Brexit deadline.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Tusk is currently in the process of consulting the 27 heads of state and government.\n\n\u201cWe spoke this morning. He is recommending that we accept an extension until January 31 that could be terminated early if the House of Commons and House of Lords ratifies an agreement.\n\n\u201cI agreed to that but that\u2019s not yet agreed by the 27 and we may have to have an emergency European Council over the course of the next few days to discuss it if he can\u2019t get consensus.\n\n\u201cMy bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.\u201d\n\nPredicting a withdrawal delay of at least three months from the EU, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage the BBC: \u201cObviously what they want is a general election or a second referendum - they want some degree of resolution, so I would have thought at least until the end of January, perhaps even longer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a former top civil servant predicted the Government would overhaul the Fixed Term Parliament Act, which torpedoes a PM\u2019s power to call a general election when they want.\n\nLord Butler, who was Cabinet Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair , told a House of Lords Committee: \u201cThe limitation of the discretion of the PM to call a general election can paralyse the Government if it doesn\u2019t have a majority, as current events show - and that can\u2019t be in the national interest.\u201d", "description": "The Prime Minister told EU Council President Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel there should be no delay", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
