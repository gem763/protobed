Instead, the money would end up in the pockets of shareholders.\n\n\"I do not know one employer who says, I note the super guarantee has been deferred, I'm going to give you a wage increase.\"\n\nThe former Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary told the gathering he'd been with former Labor prime minister Paul Keating earlier that morning.\n\nHe said the pair, who were involved in the 1983 Accord that paved the way for compulsory super, would \"go to their grave\" trying to achieve a universal scheme set at 12 per cent of gross wages.\n\n\"Even if [the Coalition] moves to 12 per cent and goes to the next election saying we want to give low-paid people the option to take their super [as wages], it will be stealing money,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a terrible thing to do to young people, it is a terrible thing to do to low-paid workers.\"\n\nIn an opinion piece published by The Guardian on Wednesday, Mr Keating blasted Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox for suggesting in an interview with The Australian Financial Review that the cost to business of the final 2.5 per cent increase in the super guarantee deserved consideration as part of the retirement income review announced last month.\n\nMr Willox, who is on the board of AustralianSuper, said that goal should certainly be 12 per cent but the question was \"how we get there and when we get there\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Kelty and Mr Hewson were attending the launch of the Crescent Think Tank, which is linked to Islamic super fund Crescent Wealth.\n\nFormer Liberal leader John Hewson told the same event that the super guarantee probably needed to move to 15 per cent because people were living so much longer.\n\nThe Morrison government says its policy is to stick to the legislated timetable of increases and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Wednesday the retirement income review announced last month would not lead to any major policy changes.\n\nMr Keating berated Mr Willox for breaking away from the \"industry fund firmament\" at the behest of the government.\n\n\"Willox is kidding us. Labour productivity has been running at 1.1 per year for the last five years and, by 2021, when the SG is set to rise by 0.5 percentage point, the accumulated labour productivity will either be 8.8 per cent or 9 per cent,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Not a dollar of this labour productivity has been distributed to wages over the last five years and is unlikely to be over the next three.\n\n\"In other words, Willox\u2019s members at AiG will have pocketed in their balance sheets at least 9 per cent of their workers\u2019 productivity, of which Willox now says they will have difficulty paying 2.5 per cent back as extra super.\"", "description": "Former union boss Bill Kelty says: \"Wayne Swan should be sitting there saying, 'I am a miserable bastard'.
