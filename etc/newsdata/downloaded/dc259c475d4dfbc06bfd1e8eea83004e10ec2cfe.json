Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images\n\nWhen I became a dog mom nine years ago, I was nowhere near prepared for the amount of pee, poop, ticks, and other stuff I would have to clean up. I also naively expected that my dog would never embarrass me by peeing on other people\u2019s floors, much less on my lap in the middle of a crowded Brooklyn subway car. Do not misunderstand me \u2014 Uli, my gray poodle, is a good dog. But she is a dog nevertheless, and accidents happen. Which is why soon after I got her my mother bought two bottles of Nature\u2019s Miracle Stain & Odor Remover, one for me and \u201cone to keep at grandma\u2019s house\u201d \u2014 her words.\n\nFor around eight years I used the enzymatic spray whenever Uli or a friend\u2019s dog had an accident. I never purchased another brand because Nature\u2019s Miracle works really well. It\u2019s made using a mix of good bacteria and enzymes that eat any remaining fluids left after you wipe up the majority of your dog\u2019s mess. This level of thoroughness, I came to find out, is especially important when cleaning pee out of textiles because trace amounts of urine and odor can hide in the crevices. If you don\u2019t quickly and fully get rid of every last pee particle, your pet will return to the spot and use it with the gusto of a cartoon dog peeing on a fire hydrant.\n\nThen this winter, at a dinner party, I noticed my friend and host pull out a bottle of Nature\u2019s Miracle to spot treat a linen napkin splattered with her signature veggie Bolognese. Just minutes after explaining that she\u2019s obsessed with the spray and uses it for everything from furniture to sweat stains, the sauce spot on her napkin was gone. After that, I adopted her method of removing and pretreating stains. The stains I have vanquished so far include chocolate from a dip cone on a white tee, coffee splatter, dried blood, and a mystery stain that came with the yellow couch I inherited from my grandmother. In all of these cases, I simply spray a generous amount of Natural\u2019s Miracle on the stain and let it sit \u2014 for older stains I\u2019ll reapply. After letting the spray go to work on my couch for several hours I returned to find the stain had completely disappeared, leaving that part of the upholstery immaculate without looking bleached or overworked as can happen with harsher products. Though my list of conquests is still a work in progress (red wine has yet to enter the picture), I have faith it can handle anything I can spill.\n\nMore Strat-approved natural stain removers\n\nMrs. Meyer\u2019s Clean Day Basil Scent Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner For that same story we spoke to Danny Seo who hosts his own show on NBC called Naturally, Danny Seo.
