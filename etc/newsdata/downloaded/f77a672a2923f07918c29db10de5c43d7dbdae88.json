The younger the baby, the more vulnerable they are to the harmful effects of infection, according to the NHS website.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nIt reads: \"The herpes simplex virus can be passed to a baby through a cold sore if a person has a cold sore and kisses the baby.\n\n\"A baby is most at risk of getting a herpes infection in the first 4 weeks after birth.\n\n\"You should not kiss a baby if you have a cold sore to reduce the risk of spreading infection.\n\n\"Sometimes neonatal herpes will only affect the baby's eyes, mouth or skin.\n\n\"In these cases, most babies will make a complete recovery with antiviral treatment.\n\n\"But the condition is much more serious if it's spread to the baby's organs.\n\n\"Nearly a third of infants with this type of neonatal herpes will die, even after they have been treated.\n\n\"If widespread herpes is not treated immediately, there's a high chance the baby will die.\"", "description": "Little Ellis Edwards, from Abergavenny, Wales, was kissed by someone with a cold sore and could have lost his life as the herpes virus took hold", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583422.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Herpes-son.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
