But it doesn\u2019t think banning cryptocurrency-based investment products is the right answer.\n\n\u201cThe WFE recognizes the volatility identified by the FCA in its consultation report and is supportive of ensuring that proper consumer protection is put in place as a priority for any new and relatively untested product on the market,\u201d the WFE said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this year, the FCA proposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related investment products in an attempt to protect retail investors.\n\nIn July, the FCA said that cryptocurrency-based derivatives and exchange traded notes, were \u201cill-suited to retail consumers who cannot reliably assess the value and risks.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, exchanges that are part of the WFE are regulated, and so, investors are protected. The issue lies with the unregulated exchanges offering cryptocurrency derivatives.\n\nBy banning these products, it immediately makes the act of selling them unlawful and in theory should protect investors. But even the regulated exchanges will be affected if this happens.\n\nAt the moment, the FCA\u2018s proposed ban is under consultation, meaning industry bodies have the opportunity to give their feedback.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the FCA will announce the final rule changes in early 2020.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
