But America deserves insight on key decisions, threats to alliances, and how dysfunction compromises our security.\n\nThe polarization of our politics has hurt us all \u2014 and the U.S. military is no exception. I witnessed this firsthand while serving as communications director for Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a man I admire and respect. I then experienced it myself while seeking to share my experience with the American public.\n\nA former Navy officer, I was taught early in my career the importance of passing on thoughtful lessons to those who will follow in our footsteps. Jim Mattis \u2014 the warrior, strategist and diplomat \u2014 has taken a vow of silence out of loyalty to President Donald Trump. But America deserves to know about key moments of decision-making, the urgent threat to our longstanding structure of alliances and partnerships, and how the lack of a cohesive strategy is adversely affecting American security. The president's sudden decision to draw down U.S. troops in Syria, at the expense of our Kurdish allies and planning for the raid in Syria last weekend, is just the latest reason why it is important to tell this story.\n\nSo, I began to write.\n\nThreats and pushback\n\nThat\u2019s when the red tape started. I expected questions to be raised by the Pentagon, and I was prepared to answer them. I also knew I\u2019d need to submit my manuscript for a security review, a step necessary to preserve our nation\u2019s security lest any classified information be inadvertently published. Despite working with some excellent professionals in the office that reviews books, I didn\u2019t fully prepare myself for the backlash I experienced from other quarters.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis and Guy M. Snodgrass on April 27, 2018. (Photo: Tech. Sgt. Vernon Young Jr./Air Force)\n\nFirst, I was told writing about my experience would be a betrayal of trust. Then came the threats. Department of Defense lawyers emailed, writing that I could \u201cface a range of consequences\u201d if I persisted in publishing my book \u2014 and citing a DOD policy document stating methods for reducing an officer\u2019s rank in retirement. It was clear the security review process was not only to protect national security, but also to delay my book and keep the story of what I witnessed from being told.\n\nThrough it all, a process that should only take one month stretched into two, then three. Despite admitting that three chapters of my book, \"Holding the Line,\" were unclassified, the Pentagon still directed their removal, deeming them too sensitive for publication. Additional unclassified information was also slated for removal. This, despite the fact I had used the Pentagon\u2019s own publicly released information as references.\n\nOnly after I filed a lawsuit was my manuscript cleared for publication.\n\nBook by Guy M. Snodgrass, to be published Oct. 29, 2019. (Photo: Penguin Group)\n\nThis experience is one no other former Defense official who chooses to share his story should have to endure. It also raises significant questions regarding transparency, highlighting an organization that selectively applied its own rules and regulations.\n\nHonorable until we dare speak up\n\nThis level of treatment demeans my service. Was this my value to the institution I served for more than two decades? To the combat sorties I flew into harm\u2019s way? It seems that military members are all honorable when we close our mouths and hold our tongues. But when we give ourselves a voice, when we dare to speak truth to power \u2014 well, then our honor is questioned.\n\nEditorial Board: Mattis promotes a book that's silent about Trump. It's a disservice.\n\nThe very best organizations encourage thoughtful critique and criticism, not only because it makes the organization better, but also because it fosters public trust through transparency. Poll after poll identifies the U.S. military as the most admired institution in our country, and the only institution that holds the respect and trust of the vast majority of the American people. But that trust is fragile. If lost, it could be gone forever.\n\nI had the experience of a lifetime working alongside Secretary Mattis. I served with public servants who labored tirelessly to further U.S. interests around the globe. I witnessed and participated in historic moments. Nevertheless, in the course of choosing to share my experience with the American public, my character and honor have been called into question. I have been called disloyal.\n\nAn obligation to speak truth: Trump is in free fall. We need insights on his fitness from Mattis, Kelly and others. Now.\n\nHonor and character, however, are found in doing the right thing regardless of the consequences, not waiting to act when it is politically convenient to do so. Loyalty is an unyielding fidelity to the truth. As public servants, our loyalty belongs to America, rather to any one person.\n\nAs for me, I appreciate the words from an Army colonel who stopped me last week to simply thank me for being willing to tell my story.\n\nGuy M. Snodgrass, chief executive officer of Defense Analytics, is a retired Navy commander who served as director of communications and chief speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James Mattis. His new book, \u201cHolding the Line: Inside Trump\u2019s Pentagon with Secretary Mattis,\u201d is available Tuesday.
