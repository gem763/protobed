The starter, rookie right-hander Austin Voth, departed the mound in the sixth inning Saturday afternoon having so thoroughly baffled the Atlanta Braves that fans at Nationals Park gave him a standing ovation. But slowly at first and then all at once, everything fell apart.\n\nWander Suero gave up back-to-back singles and the one-run lead. Then, because Manager Dave Martinez thought his bullpen was taxed, Suero returned to start the seventh. He struggled to locate his pitches and walked the first two hitters before Martinez came to get him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to go back out,\u201d the manager said. \u201c[But] he just couldn\u2019t throw strikes. He couldn\u2019t locate his cutter. The walks, as we all know, when you walk in this league, you\u2019re going to pay the price.\u201d\n\nFernando Rodney fared no better. By the time the seventh inning ended eight batters later \u2014 after a frightening beaning, an ejection and a meltdown reminiscent of April and May \u2014 the Braves had built a lead they would never relinquish in a 10-1 victory that clinched their spot in the postseason for the second straight year.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bullpen, by the time it was all over, registered just one more out (10) than runs allowed (nine). The implosion led to their eighth defeat in 12 games and made it easy to forget how much reconstruction they had done to avoid blowups such as these. The solace for those early-season collapses was time \u2014 something in short supply with 15 games left.\n\nThe defeat came shortly after the Chicago Cubs won another blowout and sliced the Nationals\u2019 lead for the top NL wild-card spot to 1\u00bd games, and the Milwaukee Brewers sit just a game behind the Cubs. The heightened stakes are apparent from Nationals Park, where the crowds for the first two games of this series have been larger and louder than they have been much of the season. The ballpark \u2014 and the tightening of the race \u2014 is not lost upon the Nationals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point in the season where every game is kind of a must-win game,\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cEven [Friday night] there was a definite playoff vibe in the stadium.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: The Nats\u2019 bullpen will be better in October \u2014 if they make it that far]\n\nRodney\u2019s outing soured from the first pitch. He threw a 91-mph two-seam fastball that ran up and in to Charlie Culberson, hitting the pinch hitter in the face. Culberson remained on the ground for several minutes, surrounded by three trainers, before he departed on a medical cart holding a bloody towel over his right eye and cheek.\n\nRodney looked visibly affected by the moment, but Martinez stayed with him. \u201cHe seemed okay,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nRodney was not available after the game. Braves Manager Brian Snitker said Culberson was awake and alert while being examined at a hospital Saturday night and that the pitch \u201cmissed the eye socket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Rodney feels awful,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nWhile Culberson was on the ground, plate umpire Tim Timmons said Martinez asked him to review whether Culberson offered at the pitch. Timmons spoke with first base umpire Bill Welke, who said Culberson did.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always sympathetic to a guy hit in the eye,\u201d Timmons explained. \u201cBut the rules are the rules.\u201d\n\nWhen Snitker realized what he thought would be a pinch runner actually would be a pinch hitter, he became apoplectic. The manager argued until Welke ejected him. The team on the field did not slow.\n\nRonald Acu\u00f1a Jr. doubled down the left field line to give the Braves the lead. Ozzie Albies tried to check his swing, but the ball glanced off his bat and landed in almost the same spot as Acu\u00f1a\u2019s \u2014 another run-scoring double. The Nationals didn\u2019t want to pitch to Freddie Freeman, so they intentionally walked him and got beat by another left-handed hitter, Nick Markakis, who singled in the Braves\u2019 last run.\n\nHow the seventh inning further unraveled again laid bare the Nationals\u2019 desperate need for a left-handed specialist with Roenis El\u00edas\u2019s timeline to return unclear and Martinez\u2019s preference to save Doolittle for the highest-leverage situations.\n\nThe bullpen didn\u2019t need to combust to assure the Nationals\u2019 loss. Suero\u2019s early hiccup would have been enough. The Nationals have scratched across one run in the first 18 innings of this series, and that came in the first after Trea Turner walked, advanced on a groundout and flew home on a double. The bats otherwise struggled to spark anything against Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz, who at one point retired 11 in a row.\n\n\u201cWe scored one run in two games,\u201d Martinez said, as if he could barely believe it. \u201cWe got to start hitting. We got to hit again. We\u2019re swinging the bats, just not getting any hits, not creating anything offensively right now. We just got to regroup.\u201d\n\nVoth, for a while, looked as if he could maintain pace. He found an electric mix of the four-seam fastball, change-up, curveball and slide. He got 20 swings-and-misses in 80 pitches \u2014 a number only surpassed this season by the Nationals\u2019 big three starters, though each of them only did it after throwing more than 100 total pitches. Even when he tired, and the Braves started to make more consistent contact, the defense helped with highlight-worthy plays from catcher Raudy Read, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman and center fielder Victor Robles.\n\nYet they and the rest of the defense could do nothing as the ball flew all over and out of reach for the rest of the night. The Nationals could not hold a slim lead on the field Saturday. The question now is whether they can hold one in the standings.", "description": "After a strong start from Austin Voth, relievers combine to yield nine runs.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EA1VfgwAbfVBqsYtcJwlU0S9dTg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4H4CDWXIYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
