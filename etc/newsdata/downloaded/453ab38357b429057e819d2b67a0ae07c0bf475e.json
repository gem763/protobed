Don\u2019t back down on even the diciest stands.\n\nHer claim of Native American ancestry and her statement that she lost her teaching job because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d don\u2019t seem well founded. And her insistence that the Ferguson cop committed \u201cmurder\u201d is contradicted by the Obama Justice Department\u2019s thorough investigation of that tragedy.\n\n2. Take what many consider unpopular stands on issues.\n\nLike many Democrats, Warren seems to have concluded that if a rule-breaking candidate like Trump can be elected president, then none of the old political rules apply anymore.\n\nSo, Warren has endorsed Medicare for All and eliminating private health insurance. She has said she\u2019d ban fracking for oil and natural gas. She has supported decriminalizing illegal border crossing, providing health care for illegals who get across and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Barone", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
