But I think that China has to respect the rule of law and democracy principles,\" explains Tomas Zdechevsky - Czech, EPP MEP.\n\nThey are calling for the European Parliament to set up a special subcommittee of the human rights group to focus on Hong Kong.\n\nIn response to this visit, China's diplomatic mission to the EU told Euornews - \"Hong Kong affairs are entirely China's internal affairs. And that No foreign government, organization or individual has the right to interfere.\"\n\n\"We need to world's support and I think that this is the fight of two values. And we have to ask Europe - which side are you on?\" says Lee Cheuk Yan, General Secretary of Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.\n\nAnd that's the question they want to leave hanging in the air here in Brussels.", "description": "A delegation of the leadership of protesters in Hong Kong are pressureing European leaders for support in Brussels.\n\nThey're trying to raise awareness about the police brutality during the ongoing demonstrations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/28/68/1000x563_cmsv2_00faf634-7d16-56dc-88fe-21ac34bef47b-4232868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
