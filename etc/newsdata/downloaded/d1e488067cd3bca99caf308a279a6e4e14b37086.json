Yet, today\u2019s announcement is unlikely to placate a movement that has demands ranging from tax reform to constitutional change, via the resignation of the billionaire president himself.\n\n\u201cThese have been difficult days,\u201d Pinera said at a ceremony in the presidential palace. \u201cOur government has heard the loud and clear message of the Chilean people who want a more fair and more inclusive society.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s approval rating slumped to 14% last week as the protests all but paralyzed the country\u2019s largest cities, according to a survey by pollster Cadem. Opposition lawmakers have announced a constitutional accusation against Pinera on the grounds of human rights violations.\n\nOutgoing Cousin\n\nPinera appointed Gonzalo Blumel as interior minister and Ignacio Briones as finance minister.\n\nBriones is dean of the school of government at Universidad Adolfo Ibanez. He has a PhD in political economy from Institut d\u00b4Etudes Politiques de Paris and was a senior adviser to the Finance Minister during Pinera\u2019s first term in office.\n\n\u201cI have a very positive opinion of Briones as an academic and an expert in public policy, but he doesn\u2019t have much experience in the political arena and this may eventually show,\u201d said Tomas Izquierdo, an economist and chief executive officer of research firm Gemines Consultores.\n\nToday\u2019s firings also included Andres Chadwick, the interior minister and Economy Minister Juan Andres Fontaine.\n\nChadwick was a particular source of anger because of the violent suppression of the protests and the fact he is Pinera\u2019s cousin. His replacement, Blumel, 41, was until now minister of the presidency, coordinating the passing of government bills with Congress.\n\nFontaine was another target of protesters after remarking that to avoid the higher subway prices, people should just get up earlier to take the subway at non-peak hours. A study earlier this year showed that Santiago residents face commutes as long as two hours.\n\nMounting Anger\n\nThe firings are unlikely to quell mounting anger over how Pinera has dealt with the protests. More than 1,000 people have been injured and over 3,000 arrested, according to the Chilean Human Rights Institute. Police and the armed forces between them are responsible for five deaths for which it is bringing homicide charges, the institute said on Oct. 22.\n\nProtests resumed in front of the government\u2019s Moneda palace after the announcement, according to images on TV.\n\n\u201cChileans have been marching against Pinera\u2019s agenda and the new interior minister is precisely the person that was in charge of pushing that agenda,\u201d said Yasna Provoste, a senator for the opposition Christian Democrats party. \u201cPinera\u2019s government just can\u2019t get a grasp of the citizens\u2019 demands.\u201d\n\nThe extent of the protests shows the challenge facing Pinera\u2019s center-right government. Pinera initially tackled the violence as a law-and-order matter, stating the country was at war with criminals. That only made things worse. He then apologized for failing to recognize genuine grievances and announced measures including raising taxes for high-income earners and lifting basic pensions.\n\nWhile more than 600 supermarkets have been looted, the occurrence of serious violence has slowed. Losses for Chile\u2019s retail sector due to looting and lost sales reached $1.4 billion since the protests began, according to the Santiago Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFormer Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, now the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she would send a team to look into allegations of human-rights violations, a move the government welcomed.\n\n(Updates with comment from opposition senator in 13th paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Eduardo Thomson in Santiago at ethomson1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Cancel at dcancel@bloomberg.net, Philip Sanders\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ten days of riots, protests and reprisals claimed their first political victims Monday as Chile\u2019s President Sebastian Pinera fired eight ministers, including the biggest hitters in the cabinet.The interior, finance and economy ministers were all dismissed, with Pinera naming a younger,", "authors": ["Eduardo Thomson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
