General Assembly.\n\nEXPERT ON WHY SAUDI ARABIA WON'T EXPLICITLY BLAME IRAN FOR ATTACKS: 'THEY WOULD BE TOAST'\n\nThe early morning strikes Saturday that hit Aramco's main crude processing facility knocked out 5.7 million barrels of daily oil production for Saudi Arabia -- or more than 5 percent of the world's daily crude production.\n\nAfter identifying Iran as the source of the cruise missiles and drones used in the attack, despite Tehran's denial, Trump deepened sanctions on Iran and took to Twitter to threaten the country, saying U.S. forces were \"locked and loaded,\" in the region.\n\nIran continues to deny responsibility and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \"all-out war.\"\n\nIRAN PLEDGES 'ALL OUT WAR' IF U.S. RETALIATES\n\nKeane said Iran's threat is simple \"fear-mongering,\" and called on U.S. policymakers, many of whom are \"paralyzed with fear from Iran's response,\" to see \"behind the smokescreen.\"\n\n\"They set up options and exaggerate the risk, so much so that they steer the...president to select an option that isn't robust enough to impose cost on the Iranians and therefore stop their behavior.\"\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo see General Keane's full remarks on the rising Iran tensions and his plan to prevent a looming worldwide recession, watch the full segment of \"Maria Bartiromo's insiders\" available on Fox Nation today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
