It moves with the current and collects faster moving plastics as they float by. Fish and other animals will be able to swim beneath it.\n\nThe new prototype added a parachute anchor to slow the system and increased the size of a cork line on top of the skirt to keep the plastic from washing over it.", "description": "A huge trash-collecting system designed to clean up plastic floating in the Pacific Ocean is finally picking up plastic, its inventor announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["David Williams"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002143459-01-ocean-cleanup-catching-plastic-super-tease.jpg"}
