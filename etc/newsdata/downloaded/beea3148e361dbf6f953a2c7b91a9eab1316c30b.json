We are now fighting on two fronts: one front against the Turkish invasion and a front against Daesh,\u201d he said.\n\nXelil said SDF fighters who had been protecting coalition forces in Syria for four years were now \u201cbeing martyred by Turkish warplanes in front of the eyes of the allies\u201d whom he said had \u201csuddenly and without forewarning abandoned us\u201d.\n\nIt was an apparent reference to a U.S. move to withdraw forces from part of the border now being targeted by Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to send their troops to the frontlines ... all we want is that they close the air space to Turkish planes and they can do this easily\u201d, he said.\n\nNoting Islamic State car bomb attacks in Qamishli and Hasaka and Turkish shelling of a jail in Qamishli that the SDF said allowed some IS detainees to escape, Xelil said: \u201cDespite all of this the world is still ignoring this reality and ignoring this coming hell\u201d.\n\nIf the Turkish attack continued, SDF priorities would change with regards to guarding IS detainees and \u201cwe will move to protect our cities and our people\u201d, Xelil said in answer to a question.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said a Turkish attack in northern Syria had revived Islamic State and called on allied states that helped fight the jihadist group to close off air space to Turkish war planes.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
