She has denied committing any offense.\n\nGoulard faced strong criticism from MEPs at her confirmation hearing in the European Parliament last week.\n\nMEPs from the center-right European People's Party have demanded that Goulard, who is affiliated with the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group, commit to resigning if she is indicted. They have suggested that would be a precondition for voting to confirm her as a European commissioner.\n\nEarlier this week, a key official from the center-left Socialists & Democrats group said they expected \"promises to step down if anything goes further in the investigation.\"\n\nIn her written answers, the French commissioner-designate stressed that she had not been convicted of any offense. \"All citizens have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty,\" she wrote. \"This is a fundamental right enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Art. 48).\"\n\nGoulard also denied allegations that she helped French President Emmanuel Macron obtain campaign financing from U.S. billionaire Nicolas Berggruen, whose think tank she previously worked for.\n\n\"I did not put Mr Macron and Mr Berggruen in contact as they knew each other,\" she wrote.\n\nShe also pushed back against criticism that her portfolio is too broad. The EPP wants the part of her portfolio covering audiovisual policy to be shifted to Innovation and Youth Commissioner-designate Mariya Gabriel, an EPP politician.\n\nCoordinators of the Parliament's industry and internal market committees will decide will decide on Wednesday morning whether Goulard should face a second confirmation hearing, three Parliament officials said.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "France\u2019s Commission nominee pushes back at MEPs\u2019 demands.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173083219-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
