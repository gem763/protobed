Our little boy doesn\u2019t give up, and we neither!\u201d\n\nJonty Bravery, 18, from west London, is accused of attempted murder over the incident and is due to appear in court for a plea hearing next month.", "description": "Family say six-year-old is making progress but faces a lengthy recovery period", "authors": ["Jedidajah Otte"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878ce6d724b44221f759f153671da1cb73212578/0_97_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab7c9506f8301bd8b850d17511202a60", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
