Today\u2019s great divide is not between left and right. It\u2019s between democracy and oligarchy.\n\nIt\u2019s Warren, Sanders or Biden vs Trump \u2013 all the other Democrats are irrelevant | Robert Reich Read more\n\nThere are no longer \u201cmoderates\u201d. There\u2019s no longer a \u201ccenter\u201d. The most powerful force in American politics today is anti-establishment fury at a rigged system.\n\nFour decades ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. The right sought greater reliance on the free market.\n\nIn those days, a general election was like a competition between two hotdog vendors on a long boardwalk extending from left to right. To maximize sales, each had to move to the middle. If one strayed too far left or right, the other would move beside him and take all sales from the rest of the boardwalk.\n\nThis older American politics is now obsolete. As wealth and power have moved to the top and the middle class has shrunk, more Americans have joined the ranks of the working class and poor.\n\nMost Americans \u2013 whether once on the left or right \u2013 have become politically disempowered and economically insecure\n\nMost Americans \u2013 regardless of whether they were once on the left or right \u2013 have become politically disempowered and economically insecure. Nowadays it\u2019s the boardwalk versus private jets on their way to the Hamptons.\n\nAs Rahm Emmanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and former mayor of Chicago, told the New York Times: \u201cThis is really the crack-up. Usually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today\u2019s squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Trump harnessed many of these frustrations, as did Sanders.\n\nThe frustrations today are larger than they were in 2016. Corporate profits are higher, as is CEO pay. Markets are more monopolized. Wealth is more concentrated at the top. Although the official unemployment rate is lower, most peoples\u2019 incomes have gone nowhere and they have even less job security.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has become even swampier. Big corporations, Wall Street and billionaires have flooded it with money and lobbyists. Trump has given out all the tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and subsidies they have ever wanted. The oligarchy is in charge.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t America risen up in protest? Because American democracy was dysfunctional even before Trump ran for president. The moneyed interests had already taken over much of it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for people to get very excited about returning to the widening inequalities and growing corruption of the decades before Trump. Which partly explains why Biden is foundering.\n\nThe stark reality is that Democrats cannot defeat Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism with an establishment candidate\n\nAt the same time, Trump and his propagandists at Fox News have channeled working-class rage against the establishment into fears of imaginary threats such as immigrants, socialists and a \u201cdeep state\u201d.\n\nBut a large majority of Americans \u2013 right and left, Republican as well as Democrat \u2013 could get excited about moving toward a real democracy and economy that worked for the many.\n\nThis is why the oligarchy is so worried about Warren\u2019s rise to frontrunner status in some polls.\n\nPolitico reports that Democratic-leaning executives on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and across the corporate world are watching her with an increasing panic.\n\n\u201cNinety-seven per cent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,\u201d billionaire Michael Novogratz told Bloomberg.\n\nThese Democratic oligarchs hope Biden, or perhaps Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar, can still take Warren out.\n\nIn just the third quarter, Buttigieg raised about $25,000 from executives at Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and hedge fund giants like Bridgewater, Renaissance Technologies and Elliott Management. And another $150,000 from donors who described their occupation as \u201cinvestor\u201d.\n\nWhere do the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on the key issues? Read more\n\nIf Biden implodes and neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar takes the lead from Warren, Wall Street and corporate Democrats hope former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg will ride into the primary at the last minute.\n\nIt won\u2019t work. The stark reality is that Democrats cannot defeat Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism with an establishment candidate who fronts for the oligarchy.\n\nThe only way Democrats win is with an agenda of fundamental democratic and economic reform, such as provided by Warren and also by Sanders.\n\nUnless Democrats stand squarely on the side of democracy against oligarchy, the risk on election day is that too many Americans will either stand with Trump or stay home.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s victory showed right v left is irrelevant but he made anti-establishment fury work for those in charge", "authors": ["Robert Reich"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad037e1f6a35f032187eee9388b920510d43b7bc/0_345_5181_3109/master/5181.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e24fd3ceb23e901752846e05b85fe410", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
