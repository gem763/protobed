This is such a beautiful hotel,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe guy who owns it must have been successful somewhere along the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was for The Washington Post,\u201d he added, gesturing to the media in the back of the room.\n\nThe Post reported Thursday on the two powerful Trump officials\u2019 attendance at an event that drives revenue to President Trump\u2019s private business. Pompeo\u2019s nod to The Post is probably referring to the newspaper\u2019s ongoing reporting into the Trump Organization and whether the company has profited off Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nTrump has come under heightened scrutiny as individuals, industries and foreign governments who would seek to curry favor with Trump have used his properties for events and overnight stays.\n\nMost recently, Pence\u2019s decision to stay at a Trump-owned hotel in Ireland, 140 miles away from his meetings in Dublin, led the House Oversight Committee to launch an investigation into whether Pence was using taxpayer dollars to enrich the president.\n\nWhile Pence has hosted and appeared at numerous events at Trump properties, this appears to be the first time Pompeo headlined at his boss\u2019s hotel.", "description": "\u201cI look around.
