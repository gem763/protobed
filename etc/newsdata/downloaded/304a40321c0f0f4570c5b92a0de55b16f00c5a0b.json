Tracy Moore, who had been arrested on a charge of drunk driving\n\n\u2018I was shocked,\u2019 Catalano told the Herald. \u2018Nobody talks like that in 2019.\u2019\n\nCatalano informed Moore, who is African American, about the Slur but the lawyer did not confront Espinoza during the administrative hearing on September 4.\n\nInstead, he ordered Espinoza to apologize within two hours, saying he would forget about the comment if he admitted to saying it.\n\nThe hearing, at a Florida Department of Motor Vehicles office in West Miami-Dade, was being held to determine whether Moore could keep her driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u2018I was disgusted by that and they have video in the hallway,\u2019 Catalano wrote in a text. \u2018Apologize and we drop it.\u2019\n\nThe aide reportedly replied with a brief apology, indicating that he now considered the matter \u2018done\u2019.
