It\u2019s the step where Biden announces he\u2019s withdrawing from the race.\n\nBIDEN, IN RESURFACED 2017 CLIP, RECOUNTS BIZARRE RAZOR-AND-CHAIN SHOWDOWN WITH 'BAD DUDE' GANG LEADER CORN POP\n\nYes, yes, I\u2019m aware that he\u2019s the front-runner for the Democrats\u2019 nomination and that front-runners never exit voluntarily. But I\u2019m also aware that Biden knows something else, too: that growing concerns about his mental and physical capacity are legitimate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHe also must know that he and his team are not fooling anyone with claims that all is well.

They have every problem coming to them. Make sure that every single child does, does in fact, have 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds go to school. Not day care, school. We bring social workers into some and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help, they don\u2019t know what \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the \u00adradio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player \u2014 on at night, make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the social media storm about the moment his upper teeth apparently dropped as he began to speak, and he used his tongue to push them up.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST", "description": "Joe Biden ought to walk off the stage before he gets pushed off.
