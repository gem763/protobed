That\u2019s our focus for the next nine days,\u201d Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said when asked if he was open to Poloz staying on for a second term.\n\nPolls show Scheer\u2019s Conservatives are in a dead heat with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s governing Liberals. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.\n\nPoloz took office in June 2013 and is in the final year of a seven-year mandate. He has not said if he wants to continue in the role.\n\nAdvanced polls opened on Friday and will remain open until Monday, Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nAn overnight poll by Nanos Research compiled for CTV and the Globe and Mail put the Liberals at 33.2% and the Conservatives at 32.1%.\n\nIn Canada, the Bank of Canada\u2019s board of directors oversees the selection process but the federal finance minister and the prime minister have the final say.\n\nAsked what he would look for in a new Bank of Canada governor, Scheer said he would ensure Canadians had confidence in a governor who \u201coperates independently\u201d and who \u201clooks at economic indicators to make decisions about monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative leader was in Burnaby, British Columbia (B.C.) where he promised to establish a blue-ribbon commission to find ways to cut C$1.5 billion ($1.14 billion) in corporate subsidies annually, as promised in the party\u2019s platform\n\nThe commission, to be headed by former B.C. finance minister Kevin Falcon and former VIA Rail executive Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, would be struck within 100 days of the Conservatives taking office, Scheer said.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail, Trudeau and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who\u2019s left-leaning party has been gaining momentum in recent days, are in the vote-rich Greater Toronto Area.\n\nSingh met with supporters in Brampton, Ontario at a get-out-the-vote event on Saturday morning, while Trudeau is expected to address Liberal supporters at an evening rally in Missassauga, Ontario.\n\n($1 = 1.3196 Canadian dollars)", "description": "Canada's main opposition leader declined to say on Saturday whether he would be open to extending the central bank chief's term past June, which would make Stephen Poloz the first Bank of Canada governor to get a second term since the 1980s.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440147372&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0LG-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
