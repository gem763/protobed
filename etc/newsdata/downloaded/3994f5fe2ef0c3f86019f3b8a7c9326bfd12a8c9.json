Lokomotiv Moscow Some canny additions with plenty of European experience to complement a strong Russian base, but not enough top-end quality to predict progression. Getty Images 8/33 26. Galatasaray Jean Michael Seri and Ryan Babel have joined the Turkish champions, which bodes well after Fulham's efforts last season, even if Babel was something of a find. Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25. Red Star Belgrade The Serbian side will be bothersome at home, and have just installed a tank outside their ground for extra intimidation points, as they were last year, when they beat Liverpool. Lack true forward quality, though. Getty Images 10/33 24. FC Salzburg Austrian champions in each of the last six seasons, which counts for something. Not much, mind you, hence the low ranking. Getty Images 11/33 23. Atalanta Punched well above their weight as the surprise Serie A packages last season, but they may struggle more at this level. Getty Images 12/33 22. Shakhtar Donetsk A faded force from the heady Uefa Cup winning days, but they remain an entertaining Brazilian/Ukranian ying and yang. They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/33 17. Lyon More impressive in the Champions League than Ligue 1 last season, in many ways. Gone are Tanguy Ndombele, Ferland Mendy and Nabil Fekir, however - a tough ask to replace such quality. AFP/Getty Images 18/33 16. Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nTottenham Hotspur and Chelsea are currently undercut by periods of transition which could see them face a bit more difficulty, but then the same is true of much of Europe\u2019s top tier.\n\nAll of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid are attempting reboots, to varying degrees of necessity, and varying degrees of execution.\n\nNone currently look near the level of Liverpool or City.\n\nThe more compelling element to all of this is that some of them are really going all in in order to get to that level. Juve\u2019s transfer business has perhaps been the most eye-catching of the summer, not least because of the young talent they\u2019ve been willing to sell. It illustrates how they\u2019ve really put so much on Cristiano Ronaldo to finally deliver this trophy.\n\nAs regards the other dominant star of this era, Barca were so willing to keep Leo Messi content that they embarked on extravagant pursuit of former teammate Neymar, to go with Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong.\n\nIt was a move of such scale it would changed the landscape of the super-club tier even further - which was one reason why it collapsed. It was almost too big to happen.\n\nAs it is, Neymar has indicated to PSG that he is willing to knuckle down, to work alongside the other future great in Kylian Mbappe to move towards finally winning that first Champions League. This is another elusive element of the competition. The French champions are probably closest to either Liverpool or City in terms of overall level of squad and the application of an actual idea. The reason they haven\u2019t won it - or even got past the last 16 of late - is not, however, down to quality.\n\nIt is down to something more intangible, that really elevates the Champions League as a competition.\n\nIt is its great contradiction. The competition exists to crown the greatest team on the continent, but isn\u2019t designed to do so.\n\nThat\u2019s just the nature of a knock-out competition. One bad day, or even one bad moment, can detonate an entire season of excellence. Blind luck and basic chance have as great an influence as concerted quality.\n\nCity and Guardiola know this only too well.\n\nReal Madrid know the other side only too well.\n\nIt is why, although Liverpool and City are currently so much better than the rest of the super-clubs, it may not mean that much. A single bounce of a ball can render it all irrelevant.\n\nIt is this uncontrollable chaos, especially when sparked by collisions of the biggest clubs, that has made the Champions League the most spectacular of sports competitions over the last few years; that has made it high-class high-tension prime-time drama; that has made it the pinnacle of sport.\n\nThe only problem is that you have to wait to get close to peak for all that.\n\nThe huge split in resources at the top end of the game has created a huge split in the Champions League structure, where the entirely predictable group stage almost feels a different event to the wildly unpredictable knock-out stage.\n\nThere are so many engaging questions to this season but we\u2019re likely going to have to wait a while to see any of them answered.\n\nIt does feel like you could fairly confidently pick the top two to come out of each pool, in a way that seems so much more predictable than previous seasons. The only exceptions are perhaps Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s group and Chelsea\u2019s.\n\nThe latter contains Ajax, who do at least represent the hope of surprise given what they did last season. That should at the very least inspire upwardly mobile clubs like Club Brugge.\n\nAs predictable as the group stage is, there is generally always one team that upsets the order, that changes the atmosphere.\n\nIt maybe appropriately foreshadows the drama to come, and reminds that the realities of right now can become lies by May.\n\nThat\u2019s just something else this competition does. That\u2019s the prize everyone considers so worth the wait.", "description": "Around Anfield and Melwood, they\u2019re already well aware of the change in atmosphere.
