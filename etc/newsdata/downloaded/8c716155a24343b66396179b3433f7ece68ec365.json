They've been quick to note that the most recent impeachment proceedings in the nation's history \u2014 targeting Presidents Nixon and Clinton \u2014 were both launched by a resolution on the House floor.\"With regards to precedent, what rule is governing this entire process?\" Rep.(R-N.Y.) said Tuesday morning, as he headed in to hear the latest witness testimony in the Democrats' fast-moving impeachment probe.Pelosi, for months, had resisted even a mention of impeachment, fearing the political blowback it might cause to the moderate Democrats facing tough reelections next year. That changed last month, after the airing of allegations from a government whistleblower that Trump had leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine in return for political favors from that nation's leaders.In response, scores of Democrats endorsed impeachment in some form. And Pelosi announced the beginning of an official inquiry.It remains unclear if Democrats will bring an impeachment inquiry vote to the floor. And some lawmakers say there's no need to do so, warning that it would create the impression that Republicans were dictating the terms of the process.\"I don't consider it necessary myself,\" said Rep.(D-N.J.). \"I think all these process arguments are diversions, put out there by people who don't want to take about the substance because the substance is so incredibly damaging.\"News of the outreach campaign was first reported by NBC News on Tuesday.", "description": "House Democratic leaders are taking the temperature of their caucus as to whether the party should stage a floor vote to launch an impeachment inquiry officially \u2014\u00a0a move leadership has insisted is unnecessary to pursue the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/clyburnjames_022619sr_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
