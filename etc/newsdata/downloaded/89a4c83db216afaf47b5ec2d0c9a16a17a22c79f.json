After a comically disastrous meal, the tone turns melancholy, as Garland laments her unhappy life and her hosts reflect on theirs, as closeted partners in pre-legalisation 1960s Britain. It\u2019s a little moment of solidarity that gets to the heart of Garland\u2019s gay appeal.\n\nJudy Garland didn\u2019t simply tick the boxes for \u201cgay icon\u201d, she created those boxes: child stardom, tragic life, big showtunes, drag-friendly stage persona, addictions, comebacks, having sung Over the Rainbow. Not to mention her unfortunate habit of marrying men who turned out to prefer other men (weirdly, her daughter Liza Minnelli did the same). But as that scene in Judy underscores, it was a different era.\n\nJudy review: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger goes full rainbow in vanilla biopic Read more\n\nEven in her lifetime, Garland\u2019s gay following was remarked upon, often in sneering and homophobic ways. \u201cShe has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolising her,\u201d a psychiatrist helpfully explained in a Time magazine article in 1967, which observed how many of Garland\u2019s fans were \u201cboys in tight trousers\u201d. When a TV interviewer later brought up the article, Garland defended her fans: \u201cI\u2019ve been misquoted and rather brutally treated by the press but I\u2019ll be damned if I like to have my audience mistreated.\u201d\n\nHas it become easier to attain gay icon status today? Maybe you only need to tick a few of those boxes, rather than going the full Garland. Cultivating a gay fanbase can be a shrewd career move for a straight performer: just ask Kylie, or Taylor Swift. Or Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who attended this July\u2019s Pride parade in London, where she unveiled a new trailer for Judy. Is that solidarity or opportunism?\n\nOne key difference, perhaps, is that it is now possible to have gay icons who are actually gay themselves. But while we reward actors (often straight ones) for portraying gay icons on the screen, LGBTQ performers are still punished for their sexuality by the industry. Just this month we have had Cara Delevingne revealing that Harvey Weinstein once told her: \u201cYou will never make it in this industry as a gay woman \u2013 get a beard.\u201d And Kristen Stewart saying she was told she might get a Marvel movie if she didn\u2019t hold hands publicly with her girlfriend so much. Many a modern LGBTQ actor has told a similar story: Ellen Page, Rupert Everett, Ezra Miller and Sarah Paulson to name a few.\n\nAs with Judy Garland, that cherished \u201cicon\u201d status is often bound up with suffering. It is recognition not just for being fabulous, but for having paid a price. We\u2019re not over that rainbow yet.", "description": "A new biopic sees Ren\u00e9e Zellweger star as Judy Garland, an actor who revolutionised LGBT fandom", "authors": ["Steve Rose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0e87a560e7589c573377f71ed92407e9145bcb/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b664ccd3f43f689d528e507be569ed2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
