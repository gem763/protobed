REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo\n\nBut a Saturday midnight deadline for the UAW to agree on a new four-year labor contract with General Motors Co currently remains in place, a union spokesman said.\n\nUAW President Gary Jones and his predecessor were two of the unnamed officials singled out in a federal criminal complaint released Thursday detailing alleged corruption and embezzlement by union leaders, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.\n\nThe complaint has raised questions, not only about the once powerful union\u2019s leadership, but about the status of the collective bargaining talks with Detroit\u2019s automakers.\n\nThe complaint detailed charges against Jones\u2019 former second in command and successor as head of the UAW\u2019s \u201cRegion 5,\u201d Vance Pearson.\n\nIt also referred frequently to several unnamed figures, in particular \u201cOfficial A\u201d who is Jones, and \u201cOfficial B,\u201d his predecessor Dennis Williams, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe union had targeted GM, the largest U.S. automaker, as the one it wanted to conclude contract talks with and set a pattern for subsequent agreements with Ford and Fiat Chrysler\n\nThis year\u2019s talks were widely expected to be contentious, focusing on thorny issues like healthcare costs and profit-sharing at a time when U.S. new vehicle sales are declining.\n\nRelated Coverage UAW and Ford, FCA agree to temporary labor contract extensions\n\nBut according to sources briefed on the matter, the searing complaint throws into question whether talks will continue between GM and the UAW ahead of the Saturday deadline.\n\nTwo people briefed on the matter say GM may ask for a temporary extension of the contract and could pursue other options including seeking assistance from a third party.\n\nIt was not clear if the talks with GM will continue with the current UAW president under investigation.\n\nIn a statement, Ford said it agreed with the union to extend the contract talks while the focus \u201cremains on reaching a fair agreement with the UAW.\u201d\n\nRory Gamble, the official who oversees the UAW\u2019s relations with Ford, said a contract extension was \u201cnot unusual and commonly occurs when another company has been identified as the lead.\u201d\n\nNeither Jones nor Williams has been charged with any wrongdoing. The UAW did not comment on reports implicating the two, which first surfaced in the Detroit News.\n\nThe union had hoped to put the growing federal probe behind it by electing Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018. However, Thursday\u2019s arrest implicated the second in command in the region Jones ran.\n\nJones was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBut two weeks ago, the FBI raided Jones\u2019s home, a union retreat and multiple other locations as part of the corruption probe.\n\nThe federal complaint filed on Thursday said government agents had seized $30,000 in cash from the residence of Official A.\n\nA lawyer for Jones could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union agreed to temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Friday as it grappled with a federal corruption probe that has implicated its president.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429462634&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1FN", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
