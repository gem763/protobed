Another post, on Instagram, noted the campaign was developed along with Native American consultants. But the ad continued to receive heavy criticism for being insensitive and having an offensive name.\n\nSauvage in French has a variety of meanings, including wild, unspoiled and savage.\n\nCritics also decried the involvement of Johnny Depp, who is the celebrity face of the fragrance and stars in a film promoting Sauvage.\n\nA message sent to Dior seeking comment about the reaction to the ad was not immediately returned.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new ad for a Dior men's fragrance called Sauvage has sparked outrage for its use of Native American culture and symbols.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/07/09/people_johnny_depp_34902_c0-0-3984-2322_s1770x1032.jpg?49a7a5d30c56b5bc2bfd4b3d6698c12308343068"}
