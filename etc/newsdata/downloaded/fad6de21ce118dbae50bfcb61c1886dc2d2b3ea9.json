We\u2019re not talking about Big Ben or Brighton Pavilion, we\u2019re talking about amazing places that only locals know about.\n\nIn Greg James\u2019 case, his favourite place in his nan\u2019s hometown, Weymouth, is the local WHSmith, which in his opinion isn\u2019t just any stationary shop. \u201cIt\u2019s central. It\u2019s a meeting point. When I used to visit my nan or my cousins there, it would be like: \u2018Meet you at Smiths.\u2019 It\u2019s in the middle of two shopping streets, intersects them. It\u2019s great in wet weather, you can skip to a different street. That\u2019s the best thing about Weymouth.\u201d\n\nSo in the spirit of shouting out the most amazing hidden secrets from your local area, we had Romesh Ranganathan on the phone answering listeners\u2019 calls. They all had their favourite hometown hotspot, and some shout-outs were more convincing than others.\n\nHere are some of the places we found out about...\n\nGravenhurst in Bedford has a secret cat headquarters\n\nThat\u2019s according to listener Anna, who claims she\u2019s driven past a specific house several times after 11pm, only to see the same communion of cats hanging outside the front door.\n\nIt\u2019s the talk of the town, she says, and she even wonders if felines from nearby villages might be flocking from afar to hang out at this house. Although we\u2019re unsure if the owner of said residence is aware of her home\u2019s appeal to cats.\n\n\u201cI would be concerned if my house had become some kind of cat headquarters,\u201d Romesh said, and he had a point.", "description": "Here's what happened when Radio 1 listeners gave their hometown\u2019s secret landmarks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07pssn7.jpg"}
