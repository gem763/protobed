USA TODAY\n\nJosh Rosen's handle on the starting quarterback job with the Miami Dolphins didn't last long.\n\nHead coach Brian Flores told reporters Wednesday that Ryan Fitzpatrick, who started the first two games of the season under center before losing the gig to Rosen, will start Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. Rosen unseated Fitzpatrick prior to Week 3 and held onto the job for three contests before Flores reverted back to the original decision he made before the season.\n\nAs the starter, Rosen completed 50 of 85 passes (56.8% completion rate) with one touchdown, three interceptions and a fumble lost. He was sacked 12 times across those three contests as the Dolphins' season devolved into an 0-6 start.\n\nDuring the most recent shortcoming, a one-point home loss to the previously winless Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick relieved Rosen after the latter threw two picks and took five sacks. Inserted at the outset of the fourth quarter, Fitzpatrick went 12-for-18 with 132 passing yards and a touchdown and nearly completed a comeback attempt that fell short with a failed two-point conversion.\n\nWith the Dolphins in rebuilding mode for 2019, Rosen figured to be on the field a majority of the time as the organization determined whether the 2018 draft's 10th overall pick, acquired via trade with the Arizona Cardinals this offseason, is their quarterback of the future.", "description": "Miami Dolphins QB Ryan Fitzpatrick began the season as the starter before losing his job to Josh Rosen.
