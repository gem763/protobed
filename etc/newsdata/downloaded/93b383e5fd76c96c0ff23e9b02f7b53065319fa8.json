They tried to find the heartbeat and couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s when they got the portable scanning machine in.\n\n\u201cThe doctor didn\u2019t even have to say anything, I could tell from his face.\u201d\n\n(Image: Timelessvisualz)\n\nJo was then induced before giving birth on February 15, 2015 to little Alice.\n\nThe heartbroken mum said: \u201cI had some complications in the actual birth. I got an infection, Alice had shoulder dystocia so the birth was not only emotionally traumatic, but it was physically traumatic, and the worst thing was it was all quiet. Very weird.\u201d\n\nA post-mortem examination found that Alice passed away due to a problem with the placenta, reports Nottinghamshire Live.\n\nJo explained: \u201cWhen my placenta had formed, there were little parts of it that hadn\u2019t formed fully. Blood clots had occurred in those little parts.\n\n\u201cThe baby requires more oxygen from the placenta [during labour] but because of this, not enough oxygen was being passed along and that\u2019s why she passed away.\u201d\n\nJo, of Mansfield, has since experienced three further losses. She lost her daughter Olivia at 15 weeks into pregnancy and experienced two miscarriages \u2013 one at eight weeks into pregnancy and another at 12 weeks.\n\nAll of her losses were in 2015 and 2016.\n\n(Image: Timelessvisualz)\n\nThen in 2017, Jo welcomed her \u201crainbow baby\u201d James, who is now two years old.\n\nAnd Jo is expecting another baby, which is due on February 15 next year.\n\nJo has shared her story as part of Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from Wednesday, October 9, to Tuesday, October 15.\n\nJo, who works as academy lead support at National Grid, believes it is vital that more is done to break the \u201ctaboo\u201d of discussing baby loss.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen I lost Alice I never realised you could lose a baby that close to your due date.\n\n\u201cWhen you enter that world of baby loss it\u2019s like someone has pulled away a curtain and you just discover it. It shouldn\u2019t be like that. People need to be aware. It\u2019s not about scaring people when they are pregnant, people need to be aware that it happens.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about mental health wellbeing a lot, I think this is very much part of it.\u201d\n\nBaby loss awareness week runs from October 9 - 15 to raise awareness about pregnancy and baby death in the UK. Throughout the week bereaved parents unite and share their experiences.\n\nYou can join in Baby Loss Awareness Week's Wave of Light by lighting a candle at 7pm on October 15 and sharing it on social media with #waveoflight and #BLAW2019.", "description": "Jo Emmott-Myles\u2019 waters broke just days before her due date - and after a perfect pregnancy, the expectant mum thought she would be welcoming a healthy baby", "authors": ["Laura Hammond", "Image", "Timelessvisualz"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jo-Emmott-Myles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
