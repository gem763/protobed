Deaths rose 3% to 623,000, the most since 2000.\n\nThis means natural population change \u2013 the number of births minus the number of deaths \u2013 is now at its lowest since 2004.\n\nLaura Gardiner, of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: \u201cThe UK population is ageing particularly fast at the moment because rising life expectancy is being amplified by the large baby boomer generation moving from working age into retirement.\n\n\"This has huge implications for public service provision across the UK, and how those services are funded.\"", "description": "It would see the population increase by three million over the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics", "authors": ["Flora Thompson", "Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Press Association Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17262107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-493625998.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
