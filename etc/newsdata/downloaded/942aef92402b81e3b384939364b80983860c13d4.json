He is in Austria, as part of the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, starting his run at 8:15am local time. You can watch it live below.\n\nKipchoge tried the feat before, as part of the Nike Breaking 2 project but finished in two hours and 25 seconds.\n\nKipchoge holds the marathon world record (2:01:39), set in Berlin in 2018. Breaking 2 and 1:59 were and would be incredible performances, but they do not count as the record because there is no one else competing, and Kipchoge will have pacers.\n\nOn landing in Vienna, Eliud Kipchoge said: \u201cI am ready for the 1:59 Challenge. My training has been successful and I look forward to the Challenge ahead and showing the world that no human is limited.\u201d", "description": "The famous Kenyan is trying to break the elusive two-hour barrier and take distance running to the next level", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/9bd6a58a-ebfe-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_131057.JPG?itok=1ZgSjJFe&v=1570857062", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
