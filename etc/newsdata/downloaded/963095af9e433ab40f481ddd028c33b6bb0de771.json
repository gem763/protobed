He announced that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit the White House next month and simultaneously warned Ankara not to carry out threats to move militarily against Kurdish positions.\n\n\u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters. Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and trading partner, has been very good,\u201d the president said in a post on Twitter. \u201cTurkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Sen. Lindsey Graham warns Turkey of \u2018sanctions from hell\u2019 if Kurds attacked after U.S. pullout\n\nThe statements appeared to do little to restrain Turkey or ease the bipartisan fire from Capitol Hill. Key senators demanded that military and intelligence leaders brief lawmakers privately to find out exactly how much input they had in the president\u2019s decision.\n\nMr. Trump argued that he was keeping a campaign promise to end U.S. military deployment in an expensive overseas \u201cforever war\u201d and that countries in the region must sort out their differences. Critics say the withdrawal abandons a key ally, strengthens U.S. adversaries such as Iran, Syria and Russia and sends a message that the U.S. is an unreliable ally.\n\nRegional analysts said the coming Turkish military assault proves that Ankara cannot be restrained. Turkey says the Syrian Kurds have links to a militant Kurdish separatist movement inside Turkey and that the buffer zone in northern Syria could be used as a home for more than 3 million Syrian refugees who were driven to Turkey by their country\u2019s eight-year civil war.\n\nThere were also signs Tuesday that Syrian President Bashar Assad was reaching out to the Syrian Kurdish forces to renew an alliance, a development that would cement his grip over the country.\n\nHuman shields\n\nKurdish civilians in northeastern Syria reportedly began planning for large-scale sit-ins near the border with Turkey in the hopes of forming a human shield to keep the powerful Turkish military at bay. It is unclear whether such a move would deter Turkey.\n\nTurkish officials have brushed off warnings from Mr. Trump and the global community and pledged to go as far as they deem fit.\n\n\u201cWhere Turkey\u2019s security is concerned, we determine our own path, but we set our own limits,\u201d Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said.\n\nThe full offensive has yet to begin, but Turkey reportedly has begun initial strikes. The Turkish military Tuesday launched attacks on the Syrian-Iraqi border in an effort to cut off the Kurds\u2019 ability to bring in reinforcements for the fight.\n\nOnce it became clear this week that Turkey was determined to move ahead, officials said, Mr. Trump decided to move 50 to 100 U.S. special operations forces out of a key buffer zone along the Turkish-Syrian border lest they be caught in the crossfire. The U.S. will maintain its force of about 1,000 troops in northern Syria, but the withdrawal of the special operations forces removes the last barrier for Turkey to begin its onslaught.\n\nRetired U.S. military leaders expressed dismay at Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. They said the SDF, which spent years fighting alongside the U.S. against the Islamic State and suffered heavy casualties, deserves better.\n\n\u201cFor me, the overall sentiment is one of disappointment,\u201d said retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who stepped down this year as the head of U.S. Central Command. \u201cDisappointment [that] we\u2019re letting down our partners, perhaps adding to the humanitarian disaster in this region and that we may be ceding a hard-won strategic advantage\u201d that could produce a \u201cpolitical solution to this troubled area.\u201d\n\nMilitary leaders are especially concerned about the prospect of an Islamic State resurgence. The SDF is responsible for the detention of thousands of ISIS fighters, and there is growing fear that those fighters could be released or escape from prison as Kurdish attention and forces focus on the clash with Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe should remember in the beginning of ISIS, they got a lot of their combat power by breaking people out of prison in places like Mosul and other places,\u201d Gen. Votel said during a speech at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThousands of fighters instantly joined like that, and while we\u2019ve been successful in liberating the caliphate, the physical part of it, we certainly haven\u2019t eliminated the ideologies that drive them.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sanctions from hell\u2019\n\nAs Turkey advances, attention in Washington is turning to questions about what led to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision and whether Congress can reverse it.\n\nSecurity analysts say the president\u2019s withdrawal order suggests that he trusts Mr. Erdogan, who will be traveling to Washington for talks with Mr. Trump at a personal level. It\u2019s a trust that may not be warranted, they said.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen from the president has been an inclination to want to trust Erdogan, who is \u2014 let\u2019s be very clear \u2014 an autocratic figure in Turkey and an Islamist one at that,\u201d Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Washington think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it moves against Kurds in northern Syria, lawmakers are preparing their own response. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said Congress will pursue devastating economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey moves into northern Syria, sanctions from hell \u2014 by Congress \u2014 will follow,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cWide, deep, and devastating sanctions.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham, a close ally of the president, joined Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat, on Tuesday to demand a closed-door briefing for the entire Senate from military, intelligence and diplomatic leaders to learn more about the president\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that this was an abrupt decision taken in the face of reported opposition from military and diplomatic advisers, and that thousands of hardened ISIS fighters and thousands more ISIS supporters currently in detention may become free to fight again as their Kurdish captors turn to defending themselves against a Turkish incursion,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in a letter to Senate leadership.\n\nPentagon leaders insisted that military leadership was involved in discussions about the U.S. presence in northern Syria, though questions remain about whether Defense Secretary Mark Esper or Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley were explicitly informed before Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal on Twitter late Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cDespite continued misreporting to the contrary, Secretary Esper and Chairman Milley were consulted over the last several days by the President regarding the situation and efforts to protect U.S. forces in northern Syria in the face of military action by Turkey,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. \u201cThe department\u2019s position has been and remains that establishing a safe zone in northern Syria is the best path forward to maintaining stability.\u201d\n\nFormer Defense Secretary James Mattis abruptly resigned 10 months ago in the wake of another surprise announcement from Mr. Trump that he was pulling all U.S. troops out of Syria. The order was subsequently modified, and an estimated 1,000 U.S. special operations forces remain inside the country.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said, \u201cTurkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result, we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
