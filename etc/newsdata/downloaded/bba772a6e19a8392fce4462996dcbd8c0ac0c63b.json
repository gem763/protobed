It just pushed the standards even higher. I knew coming into it that it will be extremely important to win all the big tournaments.\"\n\nHailing from Macedonia, Andonovski played for several teams in Europe before an indoor soccer career in the United States. He has coached in the National Women's Soccer League for the past seven seasons, starting with FC Kansas City from the league's inception in 2013 until the team folded in 2017 and winning two titles in that time. The 43-year-old joined Reign FC in 2017.\n\nHiring a new coach was the first major task for U.S. general manager Kate Markgraf since her hiring in August as the first person to hold that position.", "description": "Vlatko Andonovski is well aware of the expectations he faces as the new coach of the U.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Ap", "Jim White", "Jason Burt", "Luke Edwards", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214439129-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLeUJvOJqnV613e1NxllMSYIixnj0N-lTmS4HQcSqwKA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
