Indeed, many journalists seem to be channeling not Edward R. Murrow, the fabled CBS newscaster, but Florence Hartley, the author of \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness\u201d in 1872. Hartley warned her readers to \u201cavoid, at all times, mentioning subjects or incidents that can in any way disgust your hearers.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) raised the issue on CNN, host Erin Burnett cut him off: \u201cThere is no evidence of Joe Biden doing anything wrong, and this is something that has been looked into, and I think \u2014 I want to make a point here \u2014 I think what we need to talk about right now is what did the president right now do or not do.\u201d Other CNN hosts have repeated the line of \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d like a virtual incantation.\n\nWhether the energy company involved with Hunter Biden was fully investigated by Ukraine is hardly a measure of culpability. Ukraine is widely considered one of the more corrupt places on Earth, where paying the children and spouses of powerful people is routine. Indeed, it is quite common in this country, too \u2014 and I\u2019ve criticized that practice for more than 30 years in Republican and Democratic administrations alike.", "description": "Law professor Jonathan Turley criticizes the media's refusal to report on allegations of international corruption against Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hunter-biden-furrowed-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
