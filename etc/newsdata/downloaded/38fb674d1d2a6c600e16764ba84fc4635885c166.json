However it is Bayer Leverkusen who are thought to be leading the race for the forward.", "description": "Despite being one of the key players at White Hart Lane, the Dane is out of contract at the end of the season and Spurs are keen to cash in during the January window to help fund a replacement.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/08/19873816-0-image-a-7_1571384966177.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
