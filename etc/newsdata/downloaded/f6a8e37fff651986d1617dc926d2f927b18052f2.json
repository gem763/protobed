A state of emergency already in place in Santiago since Friday was expanded to other cities to the north and south of the capital, and the government imposed a night-time curfew to keep people off the streets.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a hike in metro prices, but that\u2019s only a symptom of a deep underlying frustration at growing inequalities and a failure to embrace economic reform.\n\nAfter two weeks of increasingly fractious protests over a hike in public transport fares, Chile\u2019s embattled President Sebasti\u00e1n Pinera announced Saturday night that he was reversing the decision.\n\n\n\nBut, in a late-night televised statement on Sunday, Pinera appeared to inflame the situation further, saying the country was \u201cat war\u201d and labeling protesters as criminals.\n\n\u201cWe are at war against a powerful enemy, who is willing to use violence without any limits,\u201d Pinera said in the speech broadcast from the army headquarters in Santiago. \u201cTomorrow we will have a difficult day. We are very aware that [those behind the riots] have a degree of organization, logistics, typical of a criminal organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat happened Sunday?\n\nThe fare-hike reversal announcement did little to appease protesters, with the government claiming that 70 \u201cserious incidents of violence\u201d, including 40 lootings of supermarkets and other businesses, were reported Sunday.\n\nThe violence wasn\u2019t just in Santiago, with authorities reporting that almost 1,500 people were arrested in major cites across the country. The state of emergency was extended to cities including Valpara\u00edso, Antofagasta, and Valdivia.\n\nRioters in the capital set fire to buses and damaged subway stations, supermarkets, and offices. Police responded with water cannons and tear gas.\n\n\n\nSantiago came to a virtual standstill as all public transport was shut down. Shops and offices were forced to close and many flights were canceled at the international airport, leaving thousands of people stranded and unable to leave due to the curfew.\n\nThe dusk-to-dawn curfew was extended for a second night on Sunday, going into effect at 7 p.m. local time after which people should \u201cbe calm and all in their homes,\u201d according to top defense official General Javier Iturriaga.\n\nWhy are Chileans rioting?\n\nThe current crisis, the worst of Pinera\u2019s second term in office, began as a fare-dodging protest following the government\u2019s decision to hike metro fares from 800 pesos to 830 pesos ($1.13 to $1.17) for peak-time travel, following a 20-peso rise in January.\n\nBut the discontent isn\u2019t just about an increase in the price of metro tickets. Chile, one of the region\u2019s wealthiest nations, is also one of the most inequal, and protesters are demanding changes to correct the imbalance.\n\n\n\nChile has the highest per capita income in Latin America at $20,000, is expected to record 2.5 percent growth this year, and has just 2 percent inflation. However, the widespread privatization of the healthcare system and education, together with spiraling costs of basic goods and services, has led to rising inequality.\n\nThe simmering discontent with the government, and in particular with their billionaire president, was seen recently in some of the country's universities and schools over a lack of resources and underfunding.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMonday is likely to see a resumption of the protests seen over the weekend, with many banks, schools, and shops expected to remain closed.\n\nAuthorities said just one line of the city's metro was expected to reopen Monday after the entire system was closed Friday because of the damage caused during the protests.\n\nPinera has appealed for calm. During his televised address on Sunday, he said there were good reasons to take to the streets, but asked for those doing so \u201cto demonstrate peacefully\u201d adding that \u201cnobody has the right to act with brutal criminal violence.\u201d\n\nBut Pinera\u2019s appeal may have come too late.\n\n\u201cThe protests are more than just about fare increase,\u201d Boris Van Der Spek, founder of the independent news website Chile Today, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIt is about the cost of living and the level of inequality in the country. There is so much discontent in Chile. This was always going to happen one way or another.\u201d\n\nCover: A protester returns a tear gas canister to police during clashes in Santiago, Chile, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.
