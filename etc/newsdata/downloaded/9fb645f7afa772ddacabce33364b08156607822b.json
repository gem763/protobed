Walker Buehler (14-4, 3.26 ERA) gets the start for the Dodgers against left-hander Patrick Corbin (14-7, 3.25). That means for the second straight year, Clayton Kershaw won\u2019t be opening the postseason for LA.\n\nA year ago, the Dodgers went with Hyun-Jin Ryu against Atlanta, ending Kershaw\u2019s streak of six consecutive playoff appearances starting Game 1. \u201cAround here I don\u2019t know if one, two or three really matters,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThe order\u2019s a little bit less significant than people want to make it out to be.\u201d\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT STARTED\n\nThe first Division Series game of 2019 features Paul Goldschmidt and the St. Louis Cardinals facing the NL East champion Braves in Atlanta, where Hall of Famer Chipper Jones will throw out the first pitch. Freddie Freeman (right elbow) and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. (left hip), two keys to Atlanta\u2019s lineup who sustained late-season injuries, say they are healthy. Both played in a simulated game Tuesday.\n\nCardinals manager Mike Shildt said second baseman Kolten Wong, who missed two weeks with a hamstring injury, will start Game 1.\n\nMiles Mikolas (9-14, 4.16 ERA) makes his first playoff start for St. Louis opposite veteran left-hander Dallas Keuchel (8-8, 3.75). The 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner signed a one-year deal with Atlanta on June 7 and is 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA in 10 postseason games with Houston.\n\n\u201cI think when we signed him, we envisioned him making this opening start,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said.\n\nHOUSTON, HERE WE COME\n\nYandy D\u00edaz and the Tampa Bay Rays, baseball\u2019s lowest-spending team, have earned a playoff matchup with mighty Houston.\n\nAfter appearing in only one game since late July because of a foot injury, D\u00edaz hit a leadoff homer and another long ball Wednesday night as the Rays beat Oakland 5-1 in the AL wild-card game behind postseason pitching star Charlie Morton.\n\nTampa Bay stays on the road to open a Division Series on Friday against the AL West champion Astros, who piled up a major league-best 107 wins this season. It will be a reunion of sorts for Morton, who won Game 7 of the ALCS and World Series for Houston in 2017.\n\nThe Rays, who went 96-66 this season, had the smallest payroll in the majors at $66.4 million but were 4-3 against the Astros.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing having the lowest payroll in baseball and having the success we did,\u201d center fielder Kevin Kiermaier said before the wild-card game. \u201cIt always feels good to stick it to the man any time you\u2019re able to in this game, and that\u2019s something to be very proud of.\u201d\n\nSHORT STORY\n\nHouston manager AJ Hinch expects Carlos Correa to play Friday in the team\u2019s playoff opener against Tampa Bay.\n\nCorrea missed the final week of the regular season because of a sore back, but Hinch said Wednesday the star shortstop has been working out all week and feels great.\n\nThe 25-year-old Correa played just 75 games this season after sitting out from May 26 to July 26 with a broken rib. He missed a month with the back problem, which also caused him to sit out last week. He batted .279 with 21 homers and 59 RBIs.\n\nHinch said Justin Verlander will start Game 1 against the Rays, followed by Gerrit Cole on Saturday in Game 2 and Zack Greinke in the third game. Hinch wouldn\u2019t commit to a potential Game 4 starter.\n\nBRONX BATTLE\n\nThe Twins and Yankees are scheduled to work out at Yankee Stadium ahead of their playoff opener Friday night.\n\nNew York slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, who hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 12 because of a strained left oblique, appears set to return. The 36-year-old hit in a simulated game for the second straight day Wednesday and homered off left-hander Jordan Montgomery.\n\n\u201cI think yesterday was a little confidence-builder for him as far as the ability to let it go and then coming in today feeling like he\u2019s ready,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nGio Urshela, who grabbed the third base job after Miguel And\u00fajar got hurt, ended the season in a 3-for-28 slide and sprained his left ankle in Sunday\u2019s finale. Urshela tested the ankle Wednesday and said he was ready to play.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/nlds_nationals_dodgers_preview_baseball_86907_c0-188-4469-2793_s1770x1032.jpg?c79585c2bf02d5eb0b73c26b9a1390a1f289ee2b"}
