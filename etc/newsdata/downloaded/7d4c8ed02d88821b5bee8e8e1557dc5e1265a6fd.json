(Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nA New Jersey Uber driver has been fired after she kicked a gay woman out of her vehicle after seeing her kiss her girlfriend.\n\nKristin Gauthier, a freelance photographer, climbed into an Uber in South Jersey, and kissed her girlfriend goodbye. However, her driver objected to the display of affection, and ordered Gauthier out of her vehicle.\n\nIn a now-viral post on her Facebook page, Gauthier shared details of the incident.\n\n\u201cThis woman picked me up as my Uber driver. We took off. I gave my girlfriend a kiss on the cheek and she pulled the car over and said, \u2018you need to get out of my car,\u2019\u201d Gauthier wrote.\n\nWhen Gauthier asked the driver why, she responded that she \u201cwon\u2019t have that in my car.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked what she was referring to. She said \u2018you need to get out of my car because you are gay.\u2019 #uber #illegal #trumphatewithlove,\u201d Kristin wrote on Facebook.\n\nIn a video Gauthier captured with her cell phone which has now racked up over 17,000 views, she can be seen asking the driver if she was kicking her out of the car for being gay.\n\n(Warning: The video contains language that is NSFW.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the driver, whose name was Cynthia.\n\nThe altercation soon escalated, with Cynthia yelling \u201cGet out! Get out!\u201d repeatedly while shaking her finger at Gauthier.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Gauthier responds, until the driver smacks the phone in her hand. When Gauthier said that she paid the driver for a service, Cynthia shot back, \u201cI can reject any ride I want to.\u201d\n\nThe driver\u2019s statement is a direct violation of Uber\u2019s community guidelines, which makes clear that any driver who refuses to take a rider to their final destination is violating the company\u2019s rules. Uber also has a strict non-discrimination policy, which \u201cprohibits discrimination against users based on race, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age or any other characteristic protected under applicable law.\u201d\n\nYahoo Lifestyle reached out to Uber, who confirmed that the driver is no longer an employee of the company.\n\n\u201cUber does not tolerate discrimination in any form and we have been in contact with this rider,\u201d Uber told Yahoo in a statement. \u201cWe removed the driver\u2019s access to the app as soon as we were made aware of this incident.\u201d\n\nYahoo reached out to Kristin Gauthier for a comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\"You need to get out of my car because you are gay,\" a New Jersey woman, who filmed the incident, says she was told.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rDsSPJOVQgl7EFbIIjtCqA--~B/aD0xNTQ0O3c9MTI3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a88863a0-d253-11e9-af7d-65e880c53256", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
