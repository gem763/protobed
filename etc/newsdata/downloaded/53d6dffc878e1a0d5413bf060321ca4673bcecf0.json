Global trade is slowing, tariff fights have companies rethinking supply chains and the rise of one-time customer Amazon.com Inc. as a competitor show FedEx is operating in a very different business environment than the one that Mr. Smith himself helped create. The WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro writes that the threats have sapped FedEx\u2019s finances at a time when the company is racing to adjust to modern delivery demands. Some investors say the company has hewed too closely to its Express operations even as the growth of e-commerce means shipments increasingly need to travel from warehouses to nearby homes, not long distances overnight. Mr. Smith is changing the operations, though some analysts question whether the changes are big enough or coming fast enough.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nTighter operations are helping CSX Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. run more efficiently but they\u2019re not helping lure many more customers. Both railroads are implementing precision railroading techniques and both used cost cutting to keep profit erosion in check in the third quarter despite sharply falling volumes. The WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro reports the shipment figures suggest the railroads still face a challenge in convincing shippers the operations are faster and dependable enough to shift more business from rail to truck. Union Pacific Chief Executive says plentiful, cheap trucking capacity has undercut the railroad\u2019s attempts to boost intermodal business. Intermodal trade gives the railroads their strongest exposure to the relatively strong consumer economy. But those volumes have been crumbling this year, falling 5.9% in September from a year ago, according to the Association of American Railroads, and then 6.6% in the second week of October.\n\nECONOMY & TRADE\n\nA potential deal to avoid a messy break between the U.K. and European Union isn\u2019t likely to pull stalled corporate investment plans in Europe out of storage anytime soon. The agreement faces tough odds in the U.K. parliament, the WSJ\u2019s Alistair MacDonald and William Boston report, and business leaders say even an assent from lawmakers won\u2019t solve the big clouds looming over their decisions. The deal spells out the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, but not the terms on which both sides will trade\u2014the most important factor for many companies. Business investment in Britain has fallen amid uncertainty and companies have been stockpiling goods. If lawmakers approve the deal, a 14-month transition would begin. Trade talks between the U.K. and EU would also start, offering businesses hope a pact for a pact before the end of that period. But negotiations to set new terms could take years.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c You can\u2019t just overnight decide, \u2018I\u2019m going to pick up from every person in the world and every business in the world and be able to deliver it to every other.\u2019 It\u2019s fantastical. \u201d \u2014FedEx founder Fred Smith.\n\nNumber of the Day 1.9% Year-over-year decline in combined loaded container imports into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in September.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth slowed to 6% in the third quarter.
