My goal is to leverage it four times,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIf this turns out good, we could look at increasing it,\u201d he said of the initial $1-billion investment.\n\nThe Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corp. is one of a number of new funds launched by Alberta\u2019s United Conservative Party government, which ousted the NDP in an election in May.\n\nThe province created a $10-million Indigenous Litigation Fund in August to help Indigenous groups challenge laws or government decisions that hamper the development of the province\u2019s energy industry.\n\nThe fund is primarily aimed at challenges to Bill C-48, which the Liberals passed earlier this year, banning oil tankers off the northern portion of the British Columbia coast.\n\nWilson said the government has been reviewing a number of applications to access the litigation money and will be announcing funding \u201cin the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Indigenous groups are warning the provincial government to look closely at the details in their plan to ensure widespread participation in the initiative", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/a1016_biz_gmo_indigenous.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
