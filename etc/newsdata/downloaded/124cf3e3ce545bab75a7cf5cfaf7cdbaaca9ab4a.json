He says the herd is lesser-known than the Corolla heard on the northernmost parts of the Outer Banks. That herd didn't suffer any losses.\n\nHe said 21 of Cedar Island's horses survived, some managing to swim to safety. But dead horses have been washing up on beaches, while others remain missing.\n\nThe horses normally migrate to higher ground during storms, but Hancock says they didn't have time as a \"mini tsunami\" overwhelmed the island on Sept. 6.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Charlotte Observer, http://www.charlotteobserver.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
