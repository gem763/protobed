Planet Lab, founded by ex-NASA scientists, claim they have launched 146 small satellites by rocket into space. Here, Dove satellites are deployed\n\nThey orbit the globe every 90 minutes while the Earth rotates beneath them, documenting the planet as it changes.\n\nPlanet Lab also sells images to over 200 customers, many of them agricultural companies monitoring the health of crops.\n\nSpeaking on CBS's Sixty Minutes, Dr Will Marshall, co-founder of Planet, tells David Martin that he is always astonished by the quality of the images.\n\nDr Marshall and his team compare the pictures to those that were taken yesterday and see that 'something has changed'.\n\n'We see rivers move, we see trees go down, we see vehicles move, we see road surfaces change and it gives you a perspective of the planet as a dynamic and evolving thing that we need to take care of,' he says.\n\nDr Marshall and his team started out with sending twenty-eight small satellites out into orbit from the International Space Station.\n\nDr Robbie Schingler, who began building satellites 20 years ago, said: 'We took a satellite that would be the size of a pick-up truck and we shrunk it. We wanted to make it about the size of a loaf of bread.'\n\nThe satellites combine to photograph the entirety of Earth's landmass for use by intelligence agencies and humanitarian purposes. Each satellite is only about the size of a loaf of bread and weighs 12 pounds (5 kg) Here, David Martin with Robbie Schingle, left\n\nAn image taken from Planet Lab satellites in 2014. The spy satellites take high-resolution photographs all over the world including places like Russia and North Korea. They orbit the globe every 90 minutes while the Earth rotates beneath them\n\nTwenty-eight Planet Labs Dove satellites which are ready for launch at the headquarters. Planet Lab also sells images to over 200 customers, many of them agricultural companies monitoring the health of crops\n\n'The way that I grew up-- at NASA is we would spend about five to ten years, even-- to build one satellite,' he said.\n\nThe engineers at Planet build by hand and operate the 'largest fleet of satellites in human history' in a matter of months.\n\nDr Schingler, also a co-founder, said: 'Over the years, we've built about 300 satellites. Over the years. And last year we launched about 146 satellites into space.\n\n'The satellites are called doves. Here on the production floor they are kept in \"nests,\" waiting to be launched in \"flocks.\"\n\nSpeaking on CBS's Sixty Minutes , Dr Will Marshall, here on the programme, tells David Martin that he is always astonished by the quality of the images. Dr Marshall and his team compare the pictures to those that were taken yesterday and see that 'something has changed'\n\nRobert Cardillo , director of the NGA, shows correspondent David Martin around the NGA operations center. says that the top-secret pictures 'ground zero for all the intelligence coming in from space'. Mr Cardillo would not comment on the number of spy satellites the NGA currently operates\n\n'A normal mission control you will have dozens and dozens of engineers for one satellite. We flip that around, so we have dozens of satellites for a single engineer.'\n\nThe news station visited the Planet Lab headquarters, which has about 400 employees, in a nondescript building in San Francisco.\n\n'On the day we visited Planet its satellites were beaming down 1.2 million pictures every 24 hours.'\n\nAlthough the team did not see any of the top secret pictures which are analysed by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency as their phots 'rarely see the light of day'.\n\nRobert Cardillo, director of the NGA, says that the top-secret pictures 'ground zero for all the intelligence coming in from space'.\n\nMr Cardillo would not comment on the number of spy satellites the NGA currently operates.\n\nWHAT IS THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) delivers world-class geospatial intelligence that provides a decisive advantage to policymakers, warfighters, intelligence professionals and first responders. Anyone who sails a U.S. ship, flies a U.S. aircraft, makes national policy decisions, fights wars, locates targets, responds to natural disasters, or even navigates with a cellphone relies on NGA. NGA enables all of these critical actions and shapes decisions that impact our world through the indispensable discipline of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT). NGA is a unique combination of intelligence agency and combat support agency. It is the world leader in timely, relevant, accurate and actionable GEOINT. NGA enables the U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Defense (DOD) to fulfill the president\u2019s national security priorities to protect the nation.
