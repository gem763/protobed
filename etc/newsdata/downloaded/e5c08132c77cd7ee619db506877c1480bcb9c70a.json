One was for kicking the ball out of a ruck. That\u2019s a penalty and we know that. We have to tidy that up. But I\u2019m not going to talk about tackles, I\u2019m going to steer clear of that.\n\n\"The one thing we need to be mindful of is that we have not started games well. It is not that we have not played well, we have just been a little less consistent in the first 20 minutes. It gets you off on the wrong foot, so it is definitely something that we need to address.\"\n\nWallabies captain Michael Hooper backed up Cheika's point, adding that losing two players to yellow cards in the first half had disrupted Australia's rhythm.", "description": "Michael Cheika was unhappy with his side's lack of discipline after Australia's 45-10 victory over Uruguay but refused to specifically discuss Australia's ongoing problem with high tackle penalties, after the Wallabies gave away four in the first half, leading to yellow cards for Adam Coleman and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto.", "authors": ["Ben Coles", "Charlie Morgan", "Rugreporter", "Daniel Schofield", "Jonathan Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212038121-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
