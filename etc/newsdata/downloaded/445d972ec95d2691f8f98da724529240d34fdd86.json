Multiple launch rocket systems were stationed at Suruc, some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani, he said.\n\nRUSSIA CALLS FOR DIALOGUE\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria\u2019s Kurds on solving issues in northeast Syria including border security.\n\n\u201cWe heard statements yesterday both from Damascus officials and the Kurdish representatives that they are ready for such dialogue,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters during a visit to Kazakhstan.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to support the start of such substantive talks and hope it will be supported by all the key foreign players,\u201d said Lavrov, adding he spoke on Tuesday to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who said the Turkish side respected Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nKurdish-led forces said on Tuesday they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nThe prospect of a military offensive has unsettled Turkish financial markets, with the lira this week hitting its weakest level since late August. The currency TRYTOM=D3 firmed slightly to 5.8220 against the dollar on Wednesday morning.\n\nErdogan will visit the United States on Nov. 13 at Trump\u2019s invitation, a White House spokesman said. On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d U.S. Defence Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nTurkish army howitzers are positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nKurdish-led forces have denounced the U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. But Trump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria.", "description": "Turkish forces and Syrian rebel allies will push into Syria \"shortly\", a Turkish official said on Wednesday, in an operation world powers fear could open a new chapter in Syria's ruinous eight-year-old war.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438696192&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98040", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
