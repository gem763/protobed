Star running back Christian McCaffrey confirmed his status as the NFL's form back with two touchdowns, one receiving and one rushing.\n\nThe NFL leader in touchdowns and rushing yards further advanced his MVP case with another commanding display. Curtis Samuel likewise went into the endzone twice, again once as a receiver and once on the run-play.\n\nAllen's opposite number Jameis Winston passed for significantly more yards - 400 - but the story of the game was told by the five interceptions he threw.
