After scoring 11 goals and recording eight assists last season with the Flames, Hathaway already has two goals and three assists for the Capitals. The 27-year-old, who was born in Naples, Fla. and grew up in Kennebunkport, Maine, will make his return to Calgary for Tuesday night\u2019s game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special guy in terms of his compete, his battle, his character,\u201d Capitals Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cIt\u2019s really high end.\u201d\n\nHathaway averaged 10:32 of ice time last season, fewest among Flames forwards. He spent four years with the team before becoming a free agent and being added by Washington for needed bottom-six depth. In his 175 games with Calgary, Hathaway tallied only 16 goals and 24 assists, averaging 10:47 of ice time.\n\nHathaway had a unique path to the NHL starting when he began playing the sports at about 3 years old. His parents had signed his older brother up for the sport and as Hathaway said, he just \u201cwent along for the ride.\u201d In addition to actually learning the sport, the family had a pond at their house that would freeze over, allowing for constant ice time. Hathaway gives credit to his parents driving him to seemingly constant hockey camps throughout the years, with their sacrifice leading him to Brown University.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt Brown, he tallied 30 goals and 38 assists in 121 games. He was invited to two NHL development camps after his junior year, Pittsburgh and Boston. Reirden, who met him at the development camp at Pittsburgh, said he started following Hathaway\u2019s development from that point.\n\nReirden said he made some calls to Hathaway over this past summer, knowing he would be a good fit in the bottom six, and now, Hathaway has earned his spot on the third line. Hathaway\u2019s rugged style of play has earned him respect.\n\n\u201cHe makes you want to fight for your teammate and he is with us there on the ice,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cHe brings more respect on the ice. People just don\u2019t go running into him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Friday\u2019s game against the New York Rangers, Hathaway suffered a broken nose after a high hit, left the game, came back and then got into a fight \u2014 broken nose and all \u2014 and drew a penalty that led a Washington power-play goal.\n\nAD\n\nHis past reveals hustle off the ice as well. Growing up, Hathaway worked with his four older siblings at their family-owned seafood restaurant in Maine. His father soon opened a lobster processing business called Shucks Maine Lobster near Augusta, Maine.\n\nAt Brown, Hathaway and one of his teammates at the time started a lobster roll cart. It was the summer after sophomore year and the two bought an old sausage cart that was used outside Fenway Park, adjusting it into a proper lobster roll-making environment. Soon, they got permits, health codes and starting selling. It was a brief dip in the entrepreneurial world for Hathaway, but he relished in every moment of it.\n\nAD\n\nThese days, Hathaway has become a presence in the Capitals room and has exceeded expectations on the ice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done an outstanding job and deserved that bump up to the third line that he got,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cI think we\u2019re just kind of tapping into some of the things that this player can do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked about why he chose Washington in free agency over the summer, Hathaway had to collect his thoughts. There were so many reasons, he explained, it was hard to pick where to start. He eventually started with the history of an organization like the Capitals, their success over the last five years, the character of players they have in the room, and finally, that will to win.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat, that\u2019s something that was impossible to say no to,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cLike it\u2019s so it\u2019s so exciting to want to join that, that environment.\u201d\n\nHathaway knew what his role would be when he came to Washington. He was there to add bottom-six depth the team so deeply needed after its early first-round playoff exit last year. He was there to be the physical, grind-it-out player he had worked all those years to become. He knew he would have to continue to grow the areas of his game he excelled in, like forechecking, disrupting plays and embracing a two-way game. He\u2019s thriving in his opportunity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to continue to grow off the offensive experiences and being consistent,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a big part of, you know, an 82-game season, plus the playoffs, you always have to be ready to go. You always have to be dialed in.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Hathaway was one of the three offseason acquisitions made by Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan to bolster the bottom six .", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YxeE7pV0RHnxQXGL9H6IsXcuf3U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XMBFOCXPRAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
