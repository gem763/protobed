Given Labour\u2019s recent move towards a second referendum \u2013 after a prolonged journey \u2013 the Lib Dems needed to go further.\n\nThe issue of Brexit has defined the party for the last three years, and they cannot risk being outflanked by Labour if the party does adopt a more pro-Remain stance at its own party conference next weekend.", "description": "Marking a departure from the sombre atmosphere of the 2018 conference, with a leader who had all but resigned, the Liberal Democrats will meet this week on the Bournemouth seaside amid a recent resurgence \u2013 in terms of members, polling figures, and its number of MPs at Westminster.", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/18/swinson-conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
