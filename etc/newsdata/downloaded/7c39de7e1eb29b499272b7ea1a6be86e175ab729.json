Katie Hill amid allegations of improper relationship with staffer", "language": "en", "text": "In a statement Tuesday, Hill denied allegations that she was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, and condemned the distribution of sexually charged photos that reportedly involved a campaign staffer. The allegations were published last week by the conservative website RedState.org.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAllegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\u201d Hill said in the statement. \u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\u201d\n\nUnder House ethics rules adopted last year in response to high-profile sexual harassment claims involving members of Congress, it is against the official code of conduct for members to \u201cengage in a sexual relationship with any employee\u201d who works for the member.\n\nNeither Kenny Heslep, Hill\u2019s husband, nor Kelly, who is still employed by Hill\u2019s office, responded to requests for comment Tuesday. The divorce proceedings between Hill and Heslep began this summer, Los Angeles County court records show.\n\nAD", "description": "The California Democrat has denied allegations that she was romantically involved with her legislative director.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i3ike-gqfyrGnbuOeZDZQHFoh3U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXUVELXV5EI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
