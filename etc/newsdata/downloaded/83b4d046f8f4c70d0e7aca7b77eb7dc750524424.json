It would have killed me.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on the \u201cTable Manners with Jessie Ware\u201d podcast, Payne said he was \u201cdefinitely over-worked\u201d and that being in One Direction was a \u201cmega stressful\u201d period of his life.\n\nAfter five albums over five years, the boy band broke up in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt was really scary at first,\u201d Payne said of the split, which the band initially called a \u201chiatus.\u201d He went on to say that staying in the band would\u2019ve killed him \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old explained how the fame impacted him: \u201cThere\u2019s no stop button. You\u2019ve got no control over your life. That\u2019s why I lost complete control of everything.\u201d\n\nPayne talked about the \u201cdangerous\u201d patterns he was stuck in, telling Ware, \u201cI just lived so long as this reclusive pop star who was afraid of people, who just stayed inside all the time.\u201d\n\nHe also added: \u201cYou\u2019re either going to end up a crazy child star who dies at whatever age, or you\u2019re going to live life and actually get on with it.\u201d He said he has since learned \u201chow to be a person.\u201d\n\nSince the band broke up, Payne and each of the band\u2019s other members \u2015 Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik \u2014 have gone on to pursue solo careers.\n\nPayne\u2019s first solo album is \u201cfinished\u201d and slated for release in 2020.", "description": "During a podcast interview, the 26-year-old opened up about his \"mega stressful\" time in the boy band.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da749c1210000140f34a241.jpeg?cache=en60unhgzk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
