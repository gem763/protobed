It pulled back slightly from the trough and last yielded 1.470%.\n\n\"As the decline in U.S. yields show, the markets will be urging the Fed on to do more even though a September rate cut is already priced in,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.\n\nAccording to CME's FedWatch tool, traders have almost fully priced in a 25 basis point interest rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting while expectations for another 25 bp reduction being implemented at the October meeting have risen to 61% from 53% over the past month.\n\n\n\n\n\nPOUND FINDS SUPPORT\n\nSterling was last up 0.2% at $1.2107 after falling on Tuesday to $1.1959, the lowest level since October 2016.\n\nThe pound's bounce came after a British cross-party alliance defeated Prime Minister Boris Johnson in an effort to block a \"no-deal\" Brexit, leading the premier to push for a snap election.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 98.933 after rising overnight to 99.37, its highest level since May 2017, having lost some ground in the wake of Tuesday's poor ISM reading.\n\nThe euro was steady at $1.0975 after sliding to a 28-month low of $1.0926 overnight as investors braced for a potential interest rate cut by the European Central Bank next week.\n\nThe Australian dollar hovered near a one-week high of $0.6783 as traders pared expectations for an October rate cut after Australia's second quarter economic growth matched expectations.\n\nStill, Australia's growth was the slowest in a decade, keeping alive the prospect of central bank easing and limiting the Aussie's gains.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures rose 0.5% to $54.20 per barrel, trimming some of the previous day's large losses. The contracts had shed more than 2% on Tuesday after the weak U.S. ISM data raised concerns about a weakening global economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Richard Borsuk and Sam Holmes)", "description": "", "authors": ["Shinichi Saoshiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ikSfMzzm7Lie7mtiX3adhA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/ca7f452dfe09c9c2e6a388eb1b6dca7a"}
