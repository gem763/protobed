(Paul Sancya/AP)\n\nReporter\n\nEven with its thing for anniversaries, college football reached one this past winter that went uncelebrated even if people all over the country might have raised a glass of schadenfreude. It marked 30 years since Notre Dame won a national championship. That was something else, pigskin-history-wise.\n\nAs of the human poll vote of Jan. 3, 1989, which followed Notre Dame\u2019s 34-21 win over previously unbeaten West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl the previous day, the fresh national champion Irish had a then-record 11 national titles in their previous 65 seasons, eight by widely accepted poll votes and three by other selection processes in the impossibly kooky sport.\n\nThirty years on, one-fifth of the way into a new century, this happens: No. 7 Notre Dame (2-0) prepares to play at No. 3 Georgia (3-0) in a game allegedly matching two top-10 teams, and the people have seen plenty since January 1989. The people who make the lines take a game alleging to pit top-10 teams four places apart and make Georgia the favorite by two touchdowns.\n\nKeen observers and everyday citizens doubt Notre Dame\u2019s capacity to prove itself elite. Others sneer at its bygone presence in last season\u2019s College Football Playoff even as a 12-0 team. In a sport in which reputations take their time eroding, everyone has seen 30-3 to Clemson in the 2018 Cotton Bowl national semifinal, 44-28 to Ohio State (and not that close) in the 2015 season\u2019s Fiesta Bowl, 42-14 to Alabama in the 2012 season\u2019s Bowl Championship Series title game, 41-14 to LSU in the 2006 season\u2019s Sugar Bowl and never, ever forget 41-9 to Oregon State in the 2000 season\u2019s Fiesta Bowl.\n\nSome people have even seen the statistic tweeted this week by ESPN football rock star Chris Fallica. It involved the worst winning percentages against top-five teams since the year 2000 (minimum 10 games). Beyond Wake Forest at 0-16 and Vanderbilt at 0-15 and Indiana at 0-13 stood a two-team clot at 1-17: Boston College and Notre Dame. That would include 0-4 under longtime Coach Brian Kelly, only one of the four closer than two touchdowns, which makes that line vs. Georgia quite tidy.\n\n[A \u2018College GameDay sign asked for beer money. It sparked a children\u2019s hospital fundraiser.]\n\nEveryone knows the sweeping changes wreaking this: the landscape, the huge conferences and their power, Notre Dame\u2019s lack of any said conference as it has melded into the category of the often good or sometimes very good rather than the peerless. But in those 30 years, something else has changed: the American language when it comes to football.\n\nA visit back to the game accounts and player quotations of that Fiesta Bowl week bridging 1988 and 1989 is like a visit to some distant, forgotten land and not just given that quarterback Tony Rice went 7-for-11 passing. Notre Dame, which led 23-6 at halftime and dominated to finish 12-0, had its \u201cLou Holtz Era christened in true Notre Dame tradition.\u201d Holtz said, evocatively: \u201cI think Knute Rockne would have been proud of this team. They did everything we asked.\u201d\n\nAll-American tackle Andy Heck told the Los Angeles Times (and possibly others), \u201cThis is what is good and right in America, Notre Dame being number one,\u201d an observation that wrought far fewer cringes than it would today. Linebacker Frank Stams, who had weathered two 5-6 seasons, told reporters: \u201cNotre Dame breeds winners, and it was just a matter of time. Maybe not my time but somebody\u2019s.\u201d\n\nEverybody sort of nodded even if some rolled eyes.\n\nOther phrases, carefully presented in accounts: \u201cAmerica\u2019s college team\u201d . . . \u201ca Golden Dome landslide\u201d . . . \u201creturn to glory\u201d . . . \u201cthe great weight of inherent history in Notre Dame\u201d . . . \u201cThe echoes answered their wakeup call\u201d . . . \u201cEvery sport has a team like this,\u201d followed by mentions of the Yankees, the Cowboys, the Lakers . . . \u201cNotre Dame, which leads the nation in football mythology\u201d . . . \u201cIf this team is imbued with Notre Dame spirit, its success starts with flesh \u2014 strong, swift athletes, and lots of them.\u201d\n\nThe proper nouns \u201cLeahy\u201d and \u201cRockne\u201d and \u201cParseghian\u201d and \u201cDevine\u201d all remained ready in memory and for use.\n\nDuring the week, the St. Petersburg Times asked, \u201cWill the ghosts of Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy be too much for West Virginia to overcome in Monday\u2019s Fiesta Bowl?\u201d\n\nWest Virginia quarterback Major Harris quipped, \u201cNot unless they come out on the field.\u201d\n\nLong before a country became accustomed to seeing Notre Dame manhandled against Alabama or Clemson, West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen told of a team that \u201cbeat us on both sides of the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nWhen Holtz poor-mouthed, \u201cI\u2019ll be shocked if we have a good year [next year],\u201d everyone guffawed.\n\nAlmost 30 years to the day later, Notre Dame lost, 30-3, to Clemson and the Associated Press wrote: \u201cAs 12-point underdogs, the Irish needed to play their best and catch a couple breaks. Neither happened.\u201d Kelly and his players told of an incremental improvement witnesses weren\u2019t sure they saw. Clemson gained 538 yards, Notre Dame 248. Clemson rushed for 211, Notre Dame 88. The Indianapolis Star\u2019s Gregg Doyel wrote, \u201cLook, 30-3 doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nAs Notre Dame visits a risen Georgia nine months after that, more has changed than just a rate of national championships. An entire American dialect has gone shelved.\n\nThis might even please quite a few.", "description": "More than 30 years since the Irish last won a title, the program simply doesn\u2019t carry the same weight it once did.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Am", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lSqQMsolViJuoD-DRluEHJiDdyc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GAY54ZW4CQI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
