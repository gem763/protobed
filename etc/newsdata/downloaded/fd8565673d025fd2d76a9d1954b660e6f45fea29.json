(NYSE: DPZ) has received a new initiation of coverage.\n\nThe Analyst\n\nWedbush analyst Nick Setyan initiated coverage on the stock with an Outperform rating and a $280 price target.\n\nThe Thesis\n\nSetyan says Domino\u2019s financial model is among the most compelling in the publicly traded universe.\n\n\u201cWe believe sentiment is overly negative in the near-term and we view the current intensity of third party delivery\u2019s intrusion as unsustainable,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n\nAlthough the analyst concedes to the fact that competitive intrusion from third-party delivery services are having an impact on Domino\u2019s same-store sales growth, he believes near-term sentiment has turned overly negative.\n\n\u201cWe view the current economics of 3PD as unsustainable beyond the near-term from the point of view of both restaurants and third party marketplaces,\u201d he said.\n\nSetyan says the negative impact from delivery is best exemplified in casual dining and despite limited recourse, restaurants are already starting to push back.\n\nThe analyst also says the aggressive promotional cadence of third-party delivery service providers is not sustainable and growth is coming at an increasing and unsupportable cost to the providers in a fight for market share.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t pretend to have a crystal ball regarding how long the pressure from 3PD can last, we believe franchisees are healthy enough to withstand the pressure,\" he wrote.\n\nPrice Action\n\nDomino\u2019s shares traded around $242.09 at time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nWas Domino's Q2 Fresh Or Stale?
