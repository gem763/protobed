Jason\u2019s had an opportunity to come in and play Test cricket, get a feel for it and it\u2019s not quite gone how he would have liked. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll go away and work extremely hard and come back again.\n\nRoot, who said he had spoken to Roy about his omission, felt it would have been a risk to include Stokes as a fourth seam bowler. \u201cHe might be able to bowl a couple of overs here and there, but his batting, as this series has shown, is a massive part of our side and he rightly deserves to be in this team as just a batter, and a top-four batter,\u201d Root said.\n\nPlay Video 0:54 Trevor Bayliss on Joe Root's captaincy: 'I don't see too many problems really' \u2013 video\n\nRoot insisted there was plenty still for his side to play for at the Oval. \u201cIt\u2019s bitterly disappointing not to have got the Ashes back, but we haven\u2019t lost anything yet,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we square the series up.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the Test Championship points to play for as well, which down the line could make a huge difference, so there is plenty to play for.\u201d\n\nFor Australia, the captain, Tim Paine, revealed that Mitchell Marsh would replace Travis Head in an attempt to look after his fast bowlers. \u201cThey bowled a lot of overs and had a big workload on them,\u201d Paine said. \u201cWe want to be able to look after our fast bowlers. Mitchell Marsh had a couple of hundreds so he can do a job with the bat as well.\n\n\u201cWe spoke a lot about needing to pick our attacks in England. We are going to have them fresh and ready to go for the home summer. The reason Travis is not playing is because we feel we need a bit of extra bowling at the end of the series and Mitch is an all-rounder. Travis has had a fantastic start but we want to get the make-up right to win this Test match and we have to make a tough call on someone.\u201d\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nPaine said he is \u201cvery hungry\u201d to finish this Ashes series in England with another comprehensive victory. \u201cWe have spoken a lot about it. We came here to win the Ashes, not just to retain it. Last week\u2019s result was brilliant. We played very well. This Test is bigger than the last one. This is our grand final.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he took pleasure from Root being put under pressure for his place, Paine said: \u201cNot really, it has no effect on us. A week is a long time in cricket. Joe Root is a fantastic cricketer and I don\u2019t get sometimes why he\u2019s under so much scrutiny. We know how good he is and he will come hard and be looking to bounce back this week.\u201d\n\nEngland team for fifth Ashes Test\n\nJoe Root (c), Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Joe Denly, Jack Leach, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes.\n\nAustralia team (probable)\n\nDavid Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine (c, wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon.", "description": "England have made two changes for the fifth Ashes Test, with Sam Curran and Chris Woakes replacing Jason Roy and Craig Overton", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c120fecb90755d6ea26a56f8773bd44f29bfa6/0_73_1961_1176/master/1961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e785d11a5f36a0c14889904070d45cd9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
