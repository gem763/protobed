So what are the counterarguments?\n\nMaybe the place to start is by building on the point made by Coons. The institution of the presidency is not synonymous with the occupant of the office, and there\u2019s something worthwhile in keeping them distinct.\n\nWe frequently conflate individuals with institutions. The latter are viewed as simple extensions of the former, a stage on which to perform, something to be exploited for personal gain and glory.\n\nBut Donald Trump, though he is president, does not define the presidency. It predated him, it will outlast him, and one day again voters can choose an American president as an expression of their highest ideals rather than of their basest instincts.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the president is above criticism, of course. It means only that in certain circumstances, now and then, we should show respect for the office rather than disdain for the officeholder. There\u2019s no book we can pull off the shelf to tell us what those circumstances are; it\u2019s a matter of intuition and judgment. Some of us believe that when a president is introduced at the World Series, it\u2019s worth thinking institutionally more than individually. More than enough institutional wreckage is going on just now. It would be helpful if more of us didn\u2019t contribute to it, even in small ways.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it than that. Today partisan politics is seeping into every nook and cranny of American life. There are virtually no areas fenced off from politics, no sectors free from polarization, no partisan-free zones. We don\u2019t need the World Series to become part of the culture wars. At some point, we need places of repose.\n\nAt the dawn of the Trump presidency, Andrew Sullivan made this incisive point:\n\nOne of the great achievements of free society in a stable democracy is that many people, for much of the time, need not think about politics at all. The president of a free country may dominate the news cycle many days\u2014but he is not omnipresent\u2014and because we live under the rule of law, we can afford to turn the news off at times. A free society means being free of those who rule over you\u2014to do the things you care about, your passions, your pastimes, your loves\u2014to exult in that blessed space where politics doesn\u2019t intervene. In that sense, it seems to me, we already live in a country with markedly less freedom.\n\nWe need Trump in particular\u2014and politics more generally\u2014to dominate less, not more, of our national life.\n\nYet another reason to believe the crowd\u2019s reaction on Sunday night was unfortunate is found in Michelle Obama\u2019s advice during the 2016 Democratic National Convention: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d If you believed that the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants at Trump rallies in 2016 were contemptible, then \u201cLock him up!\u201d chants in 2019 aren\u2019t something you want to encourage. Imitating what you loathed is generally a bad idea.", "description": "If Trump critics think they\u2019re going to win a race to the bottom with the president, they\u2019re wrong.", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2T5RT/facebook.jpg?1572380280", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
