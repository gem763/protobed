Treasury has had to play catch up, she said.\n\n\"So there is a lot going on. It's technical and it all kind of came together at once,\" she said, adding that the New York Fed has been \"behind the curve in trying to estimate how much reserves should be in the system.\"", "description": "The New York Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday stepped into financial markets for the first time in more than a decade to keep interest rates in line with the Fed's target.
