S-Reits have in recent weeks been on an acquisition binge with billion-dollar purchases, amid a lower-for-longer interest rate environment.\n\nMCT said on Friday that its trustee and a subsidiary, 80 Alexandra Pte Ltd, have entered into a conditional share purchase agreement for the proposed acquisition of the property through the purchase of shares of Mapletree Business City Pte Ltd.\n\nThe property comprises Mapletree Business City (Phase 2) (MBC II) located at 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Pasir Panjang Road in Singapore, as well as the common premises at 10, 20 and 30 Pasir Panjang Road.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nIt has a total net lettable area (NLA) of 1.2 million square feet (sq ft) and comprises four blocks of business park space as well as the common carpark, multi-purpose hall, retail area and common property of Mapletree Business City Development (MBCD).\n\nThe 2.8-hectare property is a premium campus-style workplace, with eco-friendly features and a comprehensive suite of recreational and lifestyle amenities. Its tenants include multinational corporations such as Google, Covidien and Pfizer.\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate MCT\u2019s ownership over the entire development of MBCD, which also comprises Mapletree Business City (Phase 1) (MBC I), a four-block office and business park complex at 10, 20, and 30 Pasir Panjang Road already acquired by the trustee from the sponsor in 2016.\n\nFor the proposed acquisition, the agreed property value of S$1.55 billion was arrived at after taking into account the two independent valuations of the property by CBRE and Savills Valuation and Professional Services (S).\n\nIncluding acquisition-related expenses, the total acquisition cost is around S$1.58 billion, which MCT plans to fund through a combination of debt and equity. The equity fundraising may comprise a private placement and a preferential offering, to issue up to 500 million new units in MCT. The balance of the acquisition cost will be funded by drawing down new loan facilities totalling up to S$800 million.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to approvals from MCT unitholders at an Oct 15 meeting and a successful equity fundraising. Details of the equity fundraising, including the issue price of new units, will be announced later.\n\nMBC II had a committed occupancy of 99.4 per cent as at Aug 31. It also has stable and growing cashflows, as 97 per cent of the leases by NLA have average annual rental step-ups of about 2.3 per cent, said MCT's manager in a bourse filing on Friday.\n\nThe property is expected to be acquired at a net property income (NPI) yield of about 5 per cent, which is higher than MCT\u2019s existing portfolio\u2019s NPI yield of 4.7 per cent.\n\nTherefore, the proposed acquisition is expected to increase MCT\u2019s pro forma distribution per unit (DPU) and net asset value (NAV) per unit by 4 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively.\n\nIt will also complete MCT\u2019s control over the entire Alexandra Precinct, which is formed by MBCD and PSA Building, also owned by MCT. The Alexandra Precinct spans 13.5 hectares near the central business district.\n\n\u201cThis gives MCT greater economies of scale and flexibility in meeting tenant space requirements,\u201d Sharon Lim, chief executive officer of MCT\u2019s manager, said on Friday.\n\nUnits of MCT closed at S$2.36 on Thursday, up three cents or 1.3 per cent.\n\nAnnouncement:\n\nCircular to unitholders:", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - MAPLETREE Commercial Trust (MCT) is proposing to buy a business park in Pasir Panjang at an agreed property value of S$1.55 billion from Heliconia Realty, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree Investments, MCT\u2019s sponsor. .
