Information gathered can be passed to the defence and used in cross-examination of the complainant if permitted in court.\n\nThe surveys of frontline staff at Rape Crisis England & Wales found:\n\nAll had clients who had been asked for large amounts of personal information and most (86%) said it was now standard practice.\n\nMore than half said that when data was requested complainants were told it was required by the Crown Prosecution Service (53%) and the case might not proceed without it.\n\nAlmost all (95%) said the requests had a negative impact on complainants, with some noting it deterred people from coming forward.\n\nThe majority also noted that the requests were happening in some rape cases involving a stranger (61%). .\n\nSupport workers also noted that the information gathered from phones appeared to be disproportionate in some cases, with details about the complainants\u2019 \u201cprevious sexual history\u201d and \u201clifestyle\u201d under scrutiny.\n\nIn one case known to the Guardian, the CPS refused to bring charges in a case of rape of a 12-year-old child unless his phone was submitted for investigation. The CPS maintained digital access was necessary, although the perpetrator had confessed the rape to the police.\n\nIn another case, Barbara, a victim of historical abuse, was asked to submit her phone although the abuse had taken place in the 1970s and 80s. Evidence gathered from her phone was used against her in court by her abuser\u2019s defence to raise questions about her character.\n\nQ&A Why do the police want rape victims' phones? Show Hide Police guidance states that when investigating a crime: \"Mobile phones and other digital devices such as laptop computers, tablets and smart watches can provide important relevant information and help us investigate what happened. This may include the police looking at messages, photographs, emails and social media accounts stored on your device.\"\n\nIn investigating rape or sexual assault, the police my use that data to verify where a victim was at the time of assault, and if they had prior contact with the suspect. They are also obliged to disclose evidence to the suspect's defence teams. Defence lawyers have accused police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of failing to hand over crucial digital evidence in rape and assault cases that would have exonerated their clients. Victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents have been told they could allow suspects to avoid charges, and cases have been dropped. There is an underlying problem for police in the sheer volume of text, video and call records now available in even routine cases, and particularly in domestic abuse or sexual assault allegations involving people who already know each other - and this has been a factor in the sharp drop in the number of cases reaching court.\n\n\u201cThis exclusive new data makes plain what the specialist independent sexual violence advocates (ISVAs) across our network have been reporting for some time: that full downloads of victims\u2019 mobile data, the majority of it inevitably completely irrelevant to the case under investigation, is becoming increasingly common, even routine,\u201d said Katie Russell, a spokesperson for Rape Crisis England & Wales.\n\nHowever, the CPS insists evidence should not be routinely taken from phones. \u201cWe have been clear that phones should not automatically be requested and examined. However, in many cases, evidence from a victim\u2019s device is key in securing a conviction. By law, investigators must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry to make sure the trial process is fair for all,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said.\n\nThe Guardian reported on the patchwork approach taken by police forces in requesting access to complainants\u2019 digital devices and sensitive personal records last year. Forms released to the Guardian through freedom of information requests showed wide variation in what personal records police asked for.\n\nThe forms included requests for access to all of the contents and data from the complainants\u2019 digital devices, which can be held for 100 years, counselling notes, medical records, social services records, educational records and other personal records deemed relevant to an investigation.\n\nA standardised form to be used by all police forces dealing solely with digital evidence was published earlier this year. All CPS prosecutors and more than 93,000 officers had received disclosure training at that time. However, the form prompted concern that the data it requested could infringe on complainants\u2019 privacy rights.\n\nThe Centre for Women\u2019s Justice is challenging the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC), CPS and College of Policing on the legality of the revised digital device extraction form.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with their policy and they need to adapt it. They have created a form that we don\u2019t think is lawful because it\u2019s a disproportionate invasion of privacy, its discriminatory, a potential breach of data protection laws and it\u2019s asking women to consent without knowing what they are consenting to. In particular, it is incapable of obtaining express and informed consent,\u201d said Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice.\n\nMethodology\n\nAs there are no official figures on the number of rape cases in which complainants have been asked to grant access to their data and other personal records, the Guardian worked with Rape Crisis England & Wales to gather anonymised data from its ISVAs \u2013 frontline workers who support rape complainants through the legal process.\n\nThe figures are a snapshot of current cases of rape complainants across 12 Rape Crisis centres in England & Wales in the last week of August and 20 ISVAs at various centres earlier in the year.", "description": "Rape Crisis staff report negative effect on victims of disproportionate requests", "authors": ["Caelainn Barr", "Vera Baird"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9d2f6ea6b2b9060394632a92e8c7d08b2bccb/89_722_2468_1480/master/2468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da96a5fb95a1206f074e5957bc5e40a3", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
