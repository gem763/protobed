REUTERS/Ina Fassbender\n\n\u201cWe agree that something needs to be done but it is still open which form this will take,\u201d said the source briefed on the talks, which ended late on Friday. \u201cWe still have not agreed on a price for a tonne of C02.\u201d\n\nThe government wants to unveil its climate protection package on Sept. 20 and Merkel has said the plans would include some sort of carbon emissions pricing to finance measures aimed at reducing emissions.\n\nThe coalition partners, which include Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavaria Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are divided on how to finance Germany\u2019s march toward a green future.\n\nMerkel\u2019s conservatives have been cast as more eager to ensure that the burden of financing the measures doesn\u2019t hurt German industry. The SPD want to protect small earners.\n\nMerkel touched on those dilemmas facing her ministers in her weekly podcast.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand we want climate protections measures to be effective to meet our commitments,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand we want to be economically sensible and act in a socially acceptable way so that all people can afford climate protection.\u201d\n\nThe plans are expected to touch on a broad range of issues such as extending grants for electric car buyers, expanding a network of charging stations, raising road taxes for polluting vehicles, improving heating systems for buildings and raising a green surcharge for plane tickets.\n\nThe coalition partners will meet again on Thursday to resolve their difference before the plans are unveiled the next day.\n\nOne of Germany\u2019s main goals is to double the share of its power from renewable sources to 65% by 2030. It also wants to shut down all coal-powered power stations by 2038, which will require it to spend at least 40 billion euros on mining regions to help them weather the shift.", "description": "Climate protection measures that Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat coalition partners want to unveil next week will cost at least 40 billion euros until 2023, a person briefed on the talks told Reuters on Saturday.", "authors": ["Holger Hansen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429786211&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0CQ", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
