That\u2019s right, confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court last year.\n\nHe was confirmed by the United States Senate, which confirms judicial nominees nominated by the president to the Supreme Court. Sitting President Donald Trump nominated now-confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate, which \u2014 not to belabor the point \u2014 confirmed Justice Kavanaugh to the highest court in the land, where he continues to sit today.\n\nAnd will likely serve for many, many decades to come.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court last year despite a flood of women coming from the farthest reaches of America to fantasize publicly about sexual relations with Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nLike sex symbols of every stripe, Justice Kavanaugh has been reduced to nothing but his virile male-ness. His thoughts and his words mean nothing to these rabid sexual fantasizers. They cannot judge the man for his mind or his actions, only for his body.\n\nNobody is more thoroughly caught up in full swoon hyper-sexualizing confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh than the Gray Lady herself, the New York Times. After decades of menopause, the Gray Lady has gone into heat.\n\nTake that, Sarah, wife of Abraham!\n\nIn a Twitter message, the Horny Gray Lady dreamed of \u201charmless fun\u201d with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, disrobed.\n\n\u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when [confirmed Supreme Court Justice] Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\nClearly, according to the Horny Gray Lady, Ms. Ramirez just doesn\u2019t know a good time when it is shoved in her face.\n\nAll of this would be terribly troubling if it were not pure fantasy. But then again, it is terribly troubling that there are all these women in America today so thoroughly stricken by such fantasies involving a man they have never met.\n\nClearly, these are people who are sick and broken. All alone. They are crazed stalkers who hear voices in their heads.\n\nIt is hard not to feel sorry for them.\n\nEven more worrisome than their present obsession with confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is what happens to their minds when their spiritual idol, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, hangs up her robe for good. After all, she is 86 years old.\n\nThey just have to pray that she doesn\u2019t quit in the next five years.\n\nBut then again, Justice Ginsburg is still four years younger than Sarah was when she gave birth to Isaac. So, at least there is that.\n\nIn the meantime, keep your skirt on, you dirty Gray Lady!\n\n\u2981 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
