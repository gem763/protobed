I know it\u2019s week five of Paradise. I know you\u2019re feeling lonely. But you can\u2019t just show up in this palapa, tell me you\u2019ve decided you have no other options, and expect that to make everything right. It doesn\u2019t work this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, how does it work?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, because it seems like neither of us are capable of the introspection required to have a successful relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about this way: I\u2019m all in for the way you\u2019ve roasted me on all social media platforms. I\u2019m all in for the fact that it takes you a half hour to order a margarita because Wells and Demi are busy giving us bad relationship advice. I\u2019m all in for that look on your face when I\u2019m being a privileged asshole. I\u2019m all in for the way I can still see your highlighter on my chest after we hug awkwardly. I\u2019m all in for the fact that you\u2019re the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night because you\u2019re the only human woman willing to talk to me. And it is because I\u2019m lonely. And it is because it\u2019s week five. I came here to this daybed because when you realize you\u2019re about to be eliminated from a reality TV show, you want to stop that from happening as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Derek\u2019s untimely departure, Blake is ruminating on the idea that maybe he should do the same thing, but instead of coming to a mature conclusion to remove yourself from a situation that\u2019s bad for you, Blake decides that he\u2019s obviously meant to be with Kristina.\n\nWait. What? This is what we\u2019re doing? My God. This shit is bleak. Also, you can tell that Blake really comes alive when he has to convince a woman to be with him. He loves nothing more than wearing a woman down.\n\nAlso, Derek\u2019s absence means that John Paul Jones \u2026 won? And that Tayshia has to be with him now? John Paul Jones sits down with Tayshia to let her know that he doesn\u2019t want to put any pressure on her, which would mean a lot if it weren\u2019t coming from someone who ruined a stranger\u2019s wedding just to defend her honor. Tayshia tells him that he can\u2019t put an ultimatum on her and that he has to trust that she\u2019s able to make her own decisions and that she\u2019s smart. Listen, Tayshia definitely could have very real feelings for JPJ. Unfortunately, the strongest way she\u2019s able to express those feelings is, \u201cWell, he\u2019s so sure about me and he\u2019s a romantic who is willing to do anything for me.\u201d If this were a Lifetime movie, that\u2019s exactly how the protagonist, Perstephanie, would describe her future murderer in Tinder in the First Degree.\n\nWhen you buy into so many myths and stories about \u201cromance\u201d and \u201csoul mates,\u201d it\u2019s really easy to confuse someone\u2019s unhealthy infatuation with you as an actual romantic interest. JPJ is obsessed with Tayshia because he\u2019s decided at 24 that he\u2019s tired of searching for a wife and he\u2019ll never meet another woman like Tayshia. They spent, like, a full week not talking while Tayshia was pursuing Derek and JPJ was blowing his nose into a crab\u2019s little hole in the sand. What is this relationship based on? You\u2019re not allowed to say \u201cchemistry.\u201d \u201cChemistry\u201d just means \u201cwe want to bang each other,\u201d and you can scratch that itch real easy. Instead, Tayshia is looking at a man who runs into the ocean with his chinos on and catches a fish with his bare hands and is thinking, Maybe we have potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Clay is moping because he doesn\u2019t like that he has to see his ex dating his friends in Paradise. Everyone around him seems completely incapable of reconciling that someone wouldn\u2019t want to get back together with their ex but also doesn\u2019t want to see them prospering. There are exes who I would happily let my mom run over with her car, and she\u2019s offered, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I would want to sit on a balcony and watch them go on a date with whatever boring-ass bitch they date after me.\n\nWhat is more telling than the fact that Clay is able to support having more than two feelings inside his body at a time is that he\u2019s unable to keep these feelings separate from how he feels about Nicole. Instead of Nicole freaking out that Angela has some master plan that she\u2019s just waiting to enact, she should be asking her boyfriend a question, not being his counterweight during a beach workout.\n\nAngela and Clay sit down during the cocktail party to chat about their issues, and it seems like part of Clay\u2019s problem with the relationship was that Angela didn\u2019t want to spend almost four hours at the gym with him. Bitch, I get it. It also seems like Clay decided that Angela was looking for someone to support her in her pursuit to be a wife and mother and he \u2026 didn\u2019t want to do that. Angela is mostly confused and frustrated by Clay\u2019s rewriting of their relationship, and she reminds him that she\u2019s not a drama person. Apparently, that\u2019s good enough for both of them and they\u2019re off to date Chase and Nicole. Nicole still thinks that Angela has a sneaky li\u2019l plan and makes fun of her behind her back. Girl Power!\n\nIt\u2019s time for the rose ceremony and THIS IS BULLSHIT. Sure, sure, sure. There was a whole thing where Old Matt Donald won\u2019t kiss Sydney because his mom will freak out that her adult son is semi-passionately kissing another adult. BUT THE REAL TRAGEDY is that we have to say good-bye to Mike Johnson. If the rumors are true, we won\u2019t be getting more Mike on our television as our next Bachelor. The fact that we won\u2019t be seeing the radiant smile of Mike Johnson on our screens every week is a nightmare. The idea that almost any woman on earth wouldn\u2019t be interested in MIKE is laughable. How can I fix this? What can I do? Can I offer my body as tribute?\n\nBut we gotta talk about the fact that when Matt and Sydney finally do kiss, the show suddenly turns into a nature documentary; there\u2019s footage of crabs waving their claws in the air and turtles singing songs of triumph. This show cannot turn into a self-referential meta romp and be an earnest exploration of love at the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the roses to be handed out. Nicole gives hers to Clay. Angela gives hers to Chase. Kristian gives hers to Demi. Okay \u2014 can I pitch something here? Demi should have been a bartender on this season, and when it was time for the final proposals, the show should have flown Kristian in like they did with Jared and Ashley I. That way the show gets its LGBTQ moment and we\u2019re saved a series of baffling rose ceremonies.\n\nHannah gives her rose to Dylan. Katie gives her rose to Chris. Haley gives hers to Luke? I guess? Caelynn gives hers to Connor. Sydney gives her rose to Matt. Tayshia gives hers to JPJ, and Kristina gives her to Blake, proving again that a man\u2019s assurances that he\u2019s a good person are more important than a woman\u2019s intuition.\n\nThe next day in Paradise, everyone is pretty coupled up \u2014 but there\u2019s a new arrival! It\u2019s Bri. Blake tells Kristina that although Bri is beautiful, she\u2019s stunning, she looks like Linda Evangelista, and Blake is totally fine to spend the day with Kristina. Even though he told the producers that he was really interested in meeting Bri and he hoped she would be joining them in Paradise. Even though Bri really wants to take him on the date. He\u2019s gonna stick with the woman he\u2019s already slept with. Emotional maturity!\n\nFinally, as the sun crests over Paradise, there\u2019s one more new arrival. After we were forced to watch him shave his mustache, Dean has returned to Paradise. He has spent a lot of time doing some introspection and self-reflection (in the four days since his last rose ceremony) and has decided that he will never be a perfect person, so why let his flaws and deep character deficiencies keep him from having a relationship! That\u2019s for Caelynn to figure out! You\u2019re probably saying that \u201cself-reflection without meaningful action is just a road trip to the Grand Canyon while you listen to sad music!\u201d and you\u2019d be right! And why come back now instead of waiting to approach her in the real world? Because she might be \u201cdeveloping feelings for someone else\u201d and Dean can\u2019t stand for that! Long Michael Cera watches on with fear in his eyes and hate in his heart. Meanwhile, all the women talk about how much love Caelynn has in her heart for Dean and how her entire relationship with Connor is a projection of her feelings for Dean onto him.\n\nDean has a proposition for her: Leave Paradise with him and be his emotional nanny while he takes absolutely no responsibility for his actions.\n\nTo be continued \u2026", "description": "Blake really comes alive when he has to convince a woman to be with him.
