Trump has alleged that Biden as vice president tried to block a corruption probe into a Ukrainian company linked to his son Hunter. But a Ukrainian official announced early this year that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. Trump hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about election interference by Biden.\n\n.@margbrennan asked @SecPompeo if it was appropriate for @RudyGiuliani to call for a Biden investigation, and Pompeo said, \u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the Vice President, I think the American people deserve to know.\u201d pic.twitter.com/zlUC3akIi3 \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cWe know there was interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Pompeo said Sunday.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller determined in his investigative report earlier this year that the Russian government \u201cinterfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d in an attempt to aid Trump.\n\nBut Pompeo was likely referring to Giuliani\u2019s evidence-free conspiracy theory about the election. He has claimed that a Ukrainian journalist whose information helped convict former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort on fraud and conspiracy charges was part of a Democratic plot to impact the election. Manafort is serving seven years in federal prison.\n\nTrump admitted Sunday he \u201clargely\u201d discussed corruption \u2014 and Biden and his son \u2015 with Zelensky after deriding the press for days about \u201cfake\u201d stories. Trump\u2019s actions are triggering renewed calls for his impeachment.", "description": "The secretary of state is tying an accusation of \"election interference\" to Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d883116210000f605d94fd8.jpeg?cache=rhprbqwjgl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
