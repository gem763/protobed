Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee -- 52 percent\n\n2. Stephen Curry, Golden State -- 10 percent\n\nAnthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers -- 10 percent\n\nKawhi Leonard, LA Clippers -- 10 percent\n\n5. Nikola Jokic, Denver -- 7 percent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso receiving votes: James Harden, Houston; LeBron James, LA Lakers; Damian Lillard, Portland\n\nIn 2015, Curry won his first MVP after capturing 100 out of a possible 130 first-place votes.\n\nIn 2016, the three-time NBA champion became the first ever unanimous winner.\n\nHe hasn't received a single first-place vote in each of the last three seasons, finishing sixth in 2017, 11th in 2018 and fifth last year.\n\nWith many in the basketball world projecting the Warriors to either miss the playoffs or be a low seed at best, it might be difficult for Curry to have a serious shot at winning the award.\n\nSo if he is in the race at season's end, it most likely means the Dubs firmly are playoff bound.\n\nCurry also fared well in a number of other categories in the survey.\n\nWhich player forces opposing coaches to make the most adjustments?\n\n1. James Harden, Houston -- 48 percent\n\n2. Stephen Curry, Golden State -- 17 percent\n\nLeBron James, L.A. Lakers -- 17 percent\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is the best point guard in the NBA?\n\n1.
