Then the former Manchester United striker slotted in to give Inter a 3-1 lead.\n\nMartinez had opened the scoring after two minutes. He added a penalty after 71 minute, following Lukaku\u2019s quick-fire double on 38 and 45 minutes.\n\nInter were in control 4-1 with 20 minutes to go, when Antonio Conte brought on winger Matteo Politano and midfielder Valentino Lazaro for their first appearances this season.\n\nThen Filip Djuricic (74) and Jeremie Boga (81) hit back for the hosts to add to Domenic Berardi\u2019s first-half goal.\n\nInter held on for a win after consecutive defeats against Barcelona in the Champions League and Juventus in Serie A.\n\n\u201cOnce it goes to 3-1 and 4-1, it should be over,\u201d said Lukaku who has now scored five Serie A goals in eight games.\n\n\u201cIn the first half, we did everything well. However, we should have scored in the first 15 minutes after the restart to really kill off the match.\n\n\u201cThe positive we take is that we got the three points, but we need to defend better than that.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to get this win.\u201d\n\nSassuolo fell to their fifth loss of the season and sit 16th just above the relegation zone.\n\n\u201cFor more than an hour we played very well, then there was a blackout that we will analyse in detail,\u201d said Inter assistant coach Cristian Stellini speaking as Conte missed the post-match conference because of illness.\n\n\u201cWe did well, but we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nAS Roma\u2019s injury crisis grew worse as they lost both Bryan Cristante and Nikola Kalinic early as they settled for a fourth draw in eight games against Ranieri\u2019s basement club Sampdoria.\n\nEdin Dzeko came on for Kalinic with his face protected by a mask after breaking a cheekbone two weeks ago.\n\nThe Romans also played the final five minutes a man down after Justin Kluivert was sent off for a second yellow card.\n\nRoma fall to sixth in the table behind Cagliari who beat SPAL 2-0 as Sampdoria stay bottom but take their first point in four games.\n\nRanieri said he had made progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied especially after only a week training together and against a very good Rome,\u201d said Ranieri, who turned 68 on Sunday. \u201cNow let me have time to get to know the players and then we will try to find solutions to score.\u201d\n\nStefano Okaka\u2019s header was enough to give struggling Udinese their second win of the season as Torino slipped to ninth.\n\nStefano Pioli takes charge of his first game as AC Milan coach later Sunday against Lecce.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Inter Milan held off a late Sassuolo surge to win 4-3 and keep pace with leaders Juventus in Serie A on Sunday as Claudio Ranieri", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/0113e1_inter-milan-coach-antonio-conte-congratulates-romelu-lukaku-who-scored-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
