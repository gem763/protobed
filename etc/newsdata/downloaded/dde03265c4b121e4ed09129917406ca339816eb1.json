It previously did so in a 2017 report [PDF] and in a 2019 report presented to the upper house of parliament over the summer.\n\nBesides BIS, the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB) and the Cezch Police's National Organised Crime Centre (NCOZ) have also contributed to taking down the alleged Russian spy network last year.\n\nCurrently, BIS is also helping antivirus maker Avast investigate a breach of its internal network. BIS said in a press release published yesterday on its site that the attack had been carried out by Chinese hackers.\n\nAcross the years, BIS has been one of the most active intelligence agencies across Europe, especially when it came to cracking down on cyber-espionage operations. For example, in 2018, BIS took down servers that have been used by Hezbollah operatives to target and infect users around the globe with mobile malware.", "description": "Czech officials said Russian operatives used local companies to launch cyber-attacks against foreign targets.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/03/8b47df02-a030-4b31-b5f1-c4679773018e/thumbnail/770x578/3c4539e5901c362e92e5096d972609a3/czech-flag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
