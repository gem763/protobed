Just 33.9% of the same age group in 2016 owned homes, the Fed said.\n\nYoung Gen Xers were also more likely to own stock at that age than millennials or boomers, at 28%, compared with 15% and 14%, respectively.\n\nwere also more likely to own stock at that age than millennials or boomers, at 28%, compared with 15% and 14%, respectively.

But even with the student debt crisis, millennial median and average debt is less than that of the generation before them when they were the same age, according to the report.\n\nThe bottom line: With the financial crash, the investments that Gen Xers made when they were young still haven't really paid off, according to Emmons, and ultimately left them worse off.\n\nMillennials may not bear the same risk as Gen Xers did, but they are still having trouble accumulating wealth, partly because of student debt.", "description": "When they were the age of millennials, Gen Xers had far more financial assets than Boomers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/j8OaQOuObWEWXLpG-ACef0Z0DMw=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2018/11/30/1543611424447.png", "published_at": "2018-12-01"}
