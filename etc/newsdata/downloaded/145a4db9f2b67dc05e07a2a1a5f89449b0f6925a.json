The least-hit will be Wales and the East Midlands, with 5.4% declines apiece.\n\nThis year, most regions will see changes of less than 2%, KPMG says, with the exception of London, down 4.8%, and Northern Ireland, down 2.2%.\n\nIf a deal is struck, prices in London and Northern Ireland are still predicted to fall this year, by 4.7% and 1.2%, while most other regions will be largely unchanged. Scotland and the North West will see gains of 1.4% and 1.6%.\n\nAnd next year, all regions will gain aside from London's predicted 0.2% slide. The average increase will be 1.3%.\n\nKPMG noted that the UK housing market is healthier than it was at the time of the last housing crash - when prices fell by 15% in 2008. House prices are lower as a percentage of earnings in most regions outside London and the South East.\n\nIn addition, compared with the aftermath of the 1991 recession - when housing prices dropped 20% over about four years - mortgages are much cheaper. Back then, the Bank of England's base rate was about 14%.", "description": "House prices could drop by 6.2% next year if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, KPMG says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/171AD/production/_108573649_gettyimages-1136016910.jpg"}
