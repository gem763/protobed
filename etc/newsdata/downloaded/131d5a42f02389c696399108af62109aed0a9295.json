Next year, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of that voyage, a new \u2018Mayflower\u2019 will set sail on the same course. But there won\u2019t be any people on board.\n\nDesigned by not-for-profit research company ProMare, the Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS) will navigate the 5,182 kilometers (3,220 miles) between Plymouth, England and the US city of Plymouth in Massachusetts. Helming the vessel will be IBM\u2018s AI, featuring a menagerie of machine learning, edge computing, and cloud technologies.\n\nAccording to Brett Phaneuf, the managing director of Mayflower project, the idea for the vessel came a few years ago after the Plymouth Council suggested designing and launching a replica. He writes:\n\nThat really didn\u2019t make much sense to me. I figured why not use the opportunity to advance into the future rather than reminisce about the past? That was when the idea of the Mayflower Autonomous Ship was born. We call it MAS for short.\n\nMAS will carry research pods full of sensors that scientists will use \u201cto conduct persistent, ground-breaking research in meteorology, oceanography, climatology, biology, marine pollution and conservation, and autonomous navigation.\u201d But the real draw here is that it\u2019ll make the crossing almost entirely on its own.\n\nIBM\u2018s computer vision, LIDAR, and RADAR systems will ensure the ship doesn\u2019t collide with other objects at sea, handles rough weather well, and stays on course. It\u2019s equipped with onboard edge-technology so that it can continue on its mission even if it loses contact with IBM and ProMare.\n\nThe original Mayflower utilized cutting-edge navigation and power technology for its time, namely the stars and wind. While MAS certainly won\u2019t be charting its voyage using a compass and sextant, it will use a similar form of power: natural sunlight and wind.\n\nSolar panels and a single wingsail will provide the energy needed to power the vessel\u2019s motors and charge its batteries for night use. According to ProMare, the vessel will travel at about 20 nautical miles (knots) per hour \u2013 nearly ten times faster than the original Mayflower\u2019s plodding 2.4 knots per hour.\n\nThe MAS project is designed to test out AI technologies at sea and to inspire future researchers to brave the Earth\u2019s oceans, 95% of which remain unexplored. Phaneuf writes:\n\nThe Ocean always wins. Period. You\u2019d be a fool not to be scared of it. There is always a risk of accidents, injury and death. So, while on the one hand, I\u2019m sometimes kept up at night with nightmares of MAS being sunk in a storm, hit by a ship, or taken by pirates, it\u2019s also why we need to complete our mission. I want to be able to say to people that this can be done. I want kids today to be fearless and have the determination to achieve. It\u2019s about science and adventure. Rekindling a sense of wonder. We have to succeed.\n\nMAS launches in September of 2020. Once underway, ProMare says it\u2019ll make the voyage accessible to the public in virtual and augmented reality thanks to support from the University of Birmingham.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fmayflower.jpg&signature=b068319a951b630aae6bb310e6507fd7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
