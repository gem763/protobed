Times reported.\n\n\"The parents included the television star Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli; the actress Felicity Huffman; and William E. McGlashan Jr., a partner at the private equity firm TPG.\"\n\n\"We're not talking about donating a building ... we're talking about fraud,\" Lelling said.\n\nThe bottom line: These weren't victimless actions. It's likely that teens whose parents weren't allegedly paying millions to cheat the system were denied spots at these schools.\n\nGo deeper: See the full list of people charged.", "description": "College coaches took huge kickbacks to pass off students as recruits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/v_lmhlb07HZ4Hwcr6-C3JQqxHfw=/0x56:5184x2972/1920x1080/2019/03/12/1552422542439.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
