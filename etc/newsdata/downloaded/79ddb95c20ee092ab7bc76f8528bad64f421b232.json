It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people.\"\n\nThe pumps supply fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines.\n\nThe helicopter crashed onto the flat roof of the single-storey pub as a band was playing to around 100 people.", "description": "The pilot of a helicopter that crashed into a packed Scottish pub, killing 10 people, \"took a chance\" by ignoring five low fuel warnings, an inquiry finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9335/ff097076f8a74255b8081d0df9745f21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
