Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been untruthful in telling voters she was fired from a teaching job because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News noted Sunday, Warren\u2019s campaign tale was called into question by a 2007 interview in which she suggested she left for lack of qualifications and interest.\n\nCounty records published by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday confirm that Warren resigned and was never fired.\n\nThe Free Beacon\u2019s Collin Anderson reported:\n\nRIVERDALE, N.J.\u2014The Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u201c2nd year\u201d contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year:\n\nBoard of Education meeting minutes show unanimous approval for a @ewarren to return to teaching for a second year via @CAndersonMO \u2013 https://t.co/nIBW56qfCv pic.twitter.com/Hol53CCWnf \u2014 Eliana Johnson (@elianayjohnson) October 7, 2019\n\nThe minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher.\n\nIn the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story \u2014 one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.\n\nIn the second presidential debate in Detroit, for example, Warren said: \u201c[A]t the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me \u2014 wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
