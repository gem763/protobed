When it\u2019s that hot, we seek the chill anywhere we can find it. Air-conditioned subway cars, extra-large iced teas, and the nearest swimming pool can all provide respite, but a number of beauty products also contain ingredients that provide cooling effects. Consider incorporating these into your routine to help you keep cool.\n\nOuai After-Sun Body Soother\n\nOUAI After Sun Body Soother The powerful force of this spray, coupled with its tiny frothing bubbles and nearly dry-ice sensation, brings to mind a laptop air duster. Turn your body into a keyboard and spray liberally. Sun exposure not required for use. $25 at Sephora Buy\n\nPEACH & LILY Cold Brew Eye Recovery Stick Alicia Yoon, founder of K-beauty importer Peach & Lily, created an eponymous skin-care line last summer. Its newest member delivers the cooling and hydrating effects of an eye mask, but in a tidy stick. $28 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nEO Organic Tea Tree Deodorant Spray\n\nEO Products EO Deodorant, 4 oz Okay, so the primary reason for using deodorant isn\u2019t to cool the underarm area, nor is \u201ccooling\u201d tea tree\u2019s primary function. That said, while this formula keeps pits from stinking, it also feels refreshingly cool, making it the ideal hot weather deo. $8 at Walmart Buy\n\nSea Calm Skin Itch Relief Instant Cooling Spray\n\nSea Calm Skin Itch Relief Instant Cooling Spray Duo The one percent hydrocortisone in this spray quells everything from eczema to bug bites, but hot necks and tired feet will also appreciate its mildly bracing sensation. $64 at Sea Calm Skin Buy\n\nLano Feet Minty Foot & Leg Balm\n\nLano Minty Foot & Leg Balm The immediate icy sensation upon applying this rich cream comes pretty close to having an air conditioner (on low setting) aimed at your legs and feet. $19 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nVolition Beauty Celery Green Cream\n\nVOLITION BEAUTY Celery Green Cream with Hyaluronic Acid + Peptides Celery is high in antioxidants and fights inflammation, both when ingested and applied, which explains why former Olympic gold medalist Nastia Liukin suggested it as the star ingredient when she proposed it to this brand, which accepts fans\u2019 product ideas. We can\u2019t testify to the long-term benefits, but we\u2019re here to appreciate its short-term chill factor, which lingers for a good hour. $55 at Sephora Buy\n\nSeventh Sense CBD Soothing Muscle Balm\n\nSeventh Sense CBD MUSCLE BALM in Eucalyptus Spearmint This deodorant-shaped stick is excellent on sore muscles, but there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t use it as a general heat easer. A blend of peppermint, ginger, comfrey, and camphor do the magic in each of its six different flavors, but Eucalyptus and Spearmint just feels the most appropriate when it\u2019s 90-plus degrees outside. $25 at Seventh Sense Buy\n\nBeauty Counter Countersun After-Sun Cooling Gel\n\nBeauty Counter Countersun After Sun Cooling Gel You know how some people wear workout clothes even if they don\u2019t work out? That\u2019s how I see this soothing gel. I might rarely be in the sun, much less get sunburned, but hot weather discounts no one. This thick gel is like placing the world\u2019s thinnest ice pack on your skin. $32 at Beauty Counter Buy\n\nKinfield Sunday Spray Cooling Aloe Mist\n\nKinfield Cooling Aloe Mist Sunday Spray Aloe, cucumber, spearmint, and eucalyptus give this spray an elevated quality, not unlike the kind of flavored water inside spa waiting rooms. The addition of California prickly-pear extract helps rehydrate parched skin as well. Unrefrigerated, it feels breezy on skin. Refrigerate it and you\u2019ve got a mini ice storm on your hands. $22 at Kinfield Buy\n\nBecca Hydra-Mist Set & Refresh Powder\n\nBECCA Hydra-Mist Set & Refresh Powder The words \u201chydra\u201d and \u201cmist\u201d hint at this loose powder\u2019s magic, which, thanks to high levels of water and glycerin, feels downright wet when you brush it on. So be sure to tap your makeup brush before using it, and go lightly at first to see how it works on your skin. $39 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nPhilip B Volumizing and Clarifying Shampoo\n\nPHILIP B Volumizing and Clarifying Shampoo, Peppermint/Avocado Clarifying shampoos remove product residue and give extra attention to scalps. Add peppermint to the equation, and you get a shampoo that gives breezy stimulation while it does its work. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBriogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Peppermint Oil Cooling Jelly Conditioner\n\nBRIOGEO Scalp Revival\u2122 Charcoal + Peppermint Oil Cooling Jelly Conditioner Sometimes you\u2019ve got to break the rules to stay sane. It\u2019s suggested that this product be rinsed off after 15 to 30 seconds, but if the AC isn\u2019t cutting it and you\u2019re in for the night (or day), turn it into a hair mask and leave it on for as long as you like, or until the temperature breaks. $36 at Sephora Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "If it\u2019s too hot and sticky out to function, turn to these 12 beauty products, which all boast a cooling effect in addition to their regular powers.", "authors": ["Jane Larkworthy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/19/cooling-beauty-products/lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
