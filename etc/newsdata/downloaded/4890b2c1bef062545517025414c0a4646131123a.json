Baruch College and CUNY Hunter College. The University of Washington-Seattle rounds out the top five.\n\n(You can sort the complete rankings by a variety of measures and reweight the main contributing factors to reflect what\u2019s most important to you.

VIEW Interactive\n\nThe WSJ/THE rankings calculated which schools among the top 250 overall provide the best value, by dividing each school\u2019s overall score by its average net price according to Education Department data. The average net price is the total cost of attending a school\u2014including tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other costs\u2014minus federal or institutional financial aid that doesn\u2019t have to be repaid. Students who don\u2019t receive any aid aren\u2019t included in the calculation.\n\nStudents at Berea, a private liberal-arts college in Kentucky that ranks 155th overall, work campus jobs but pay no tuition. College President Lyle Roelofs says that makes higher education affordable for many students from families in the country\u2019s lowest income quartile. \u201cSolving the economic worry enables them to have the college experience that an upper-middle-class college student takes for granted,\u201d he says.\n\nAt CUNY, more than 40% of students are from households with less than $20,000 in annual income, and 80% of graduates leave without debt, according to the university. CUNY Chancellor F\u00e9lix V. Matos Rodr\u00edguez acknowledges the budgetary challenges the university faces, saying, \u201cWe need to be careful about the resources that we use.\u201d But the university also takes advantage of the resources of its home city, by connecting students directly with employers, especially in New York, for networking.\n\nCity College of New York is No. 205 in the overall ranking, with Bernard M. Baruch College at No. 232 overall and Hunter College at No. 208.\n\nThe four lowest-ranked schools for value among the top 250 overall are Worcester Polytechnic Institute, No. 119 overall, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, No. 143 overall, Pratt Institute, No. 237 overall, and the California Institute of the Arts, No. 170 overall. Pratt and the California Institute of the Arts are small arts colleges.\n\nThe Best Values The schools among the top 250 overall that provide the best value, based on overall score and average net price Berea College CUNY City College of New York CUNY Bernard M. Baruch College CUNY Hunter College University of Washington-Seattle University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Purdue University West Lafayette University of Illinois at Chicago University of California, Los Angeles Princeton University\n\nRavi Rajan, president of the California Institute of the Arts, says ranking methodologies are often challenging for small arts schools, in part because they don\u2019t have research programs and their more specialized teaching is more costly. \u201cOther schools have a head start\u201d in terms of their endowments and financial resources, he adds. He says the student-to-faculty ratio of 8 to 1 at CalArts fosters a mentoring relationship that helps students professionally.\n\nRepresentatives from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Pratt Institute also stressed the individualized attention the schools provide their students, as well as their efforts to increase financial aid and their high rates of graduation. A representative of Hobart and William Smith Colleges cited the university\u2019s educational value, particularly its study-abroad program, and the school\u2019s overall impact on students\u2019 professional careers, including the influence of its alumni network.\n\nMs. St. John is a former Wall Street Journal reporter.
