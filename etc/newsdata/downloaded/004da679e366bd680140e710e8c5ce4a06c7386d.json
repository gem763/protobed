Separately, a judge in Oakland, California, prohibited the policy from being implemented in four states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe rule \u2014 which was announced in August and was set to go into effect Oct. 15 \u2014 replaces a current policy that says immigrants shouldn\u2019t receive more than half their income from cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security.\n\nUnder the new more expansive definition, immigrants aren\u2019t supposed to use public benefits like Medicaid, public housing assistance or food stamps for more than 12 months over a 36-month period. Immigration officials will consider an immigrant\u2019s age, health, education and wealth to see if they are at risk of becoming a \u201cpublic charge.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He ruled that the Department of Homeland Security went beyond its authority under federal immigration law.\n\n\u201cDefendants do not articulate why they are changing the public charge definition, why this new definition is needed now, or why the definition set forth in the rule \u2014 which has absolutely no support in the history of U.S. Immigration law \u2014 is reasonable,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nThe homeland security department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis rule would have had devastating impacts on New Yorkers and our nation, and today\u2019s decision is a critical step in our efforts to uphold the rule of law,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted Friday.\n\nThe New York case is State of New York v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 19-cv-07777, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The California case is City and County of San Francisco v. Department of Homeland Security, 3:19-cv-4717, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A new Department of Homeland Security rule to screen out immigrants deemed at risk of becoming dependent on government benefits is on hold", "authors": ["Chris Dolmetsch", "Edvard Pettersson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/president-trump-immigrant-test-blocked.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
