Mustachio'd and rocking a fully-formed dadbod, Kirby is just as glamourous\u2014if not quite as well-known\u2014as his \"sister\".\n\nNothing is known about Kirby's background except that he started an Instagram account 25 weeks ago, and that he is almost always by his beloved sister's side. During photo shoots for Calvin Klein, with Cara Delevingne, at Sam Smith concerts, with animals, on roller coasters, the two are inseperable based on the other Jenner's feed.\n\nWhether he's some sort of Instagram-based performance artist constructing a fake life for the amuesement of 4,857 followers or the real deal, we can't say anything for sure yet. This is one tough nut to crack. We reached out to Kirby to see if we could subtlely get to the bottom of this twin mystery.\n\n\n\nSo pumped to do this photo shoot because they shot it in black n white which is old-timey AF. Back to basics. #milelongstare #postnap #presnack #nightmaresoccasionally A photo posted by Kirby Jenner (@kirbyjenner) on Jan 5, 2016 at 12:51pm PST\n\n\n\nThe Creators Project: What made you decide to start this Instagram account?\n\nKirby Jenner: First of all, I think it is WAY tight that you wanted to interview me for your .com! Def. excited to see what's in store for the internet. I love going on websites.\n\nI guess the idea came from my friend Karen who was like \"add me on Insta\" and I was like \"huh?\" and she said \"Insta\" and I said \"what?\" and she was like \"Instagram\" and I said \"What's Instagram?\" and she said \"it's like Twitter but for photos\" so I just sat down RIGHT THERE on the ground at Cinnabon and made an account. Pretty glad I did too because Karen takes some DOPE pics of the sunset.\n\nHow accurate is the depiction of your life in these images and videos?\n\nWell sometimes I'm way sleepy in the photos even tho I'm smiling. But other than that, they're all real true to life. One of the photographers told me that he had to photoshop mustard off the corner of my mouth but I guess that's just the business. I ain't no mustard salesman haha (That'd be so dope tho, right!?)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your relationship with Kendall Jenner like?\n\nWho? JK, pretending not to know people is my FAVORITE joke. Put that in the article. Everyone will freaking love it! Kendall and I are pretty tight. We\u2019re both super busy with our careers but still find time to hang out with each other. Our fav thing is making ice cream soup together haha. We take ice cream and melt it in the microwave. Ken-doll has the FANCIEST microwave so it's really fun. So glad she's my sister. We also love meowing at each other. Like cats! Our house is crazy haha.\n\nDo you have a favorite post? Can you tell me about what was going through your mind while capturing it?\n\nThe photo with our butts always makes me laugh. You can't see my feet, but I'm actually doing a kick flip on a skateboard. Kanye taught me how. People don't know this but Kanye is a very kind and patient teacher. I also really like the photo with Cara. She was really nice and didn't mind (too much) when I accidentally sneezed on her lobster roll.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've been continuously posting for six months. What drives you to keep going?\n\nVanity. Oh, sorry, I mean Vanity Fair, the magazine. I'm a huge fan of their horoscope section and they told me to \"Keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nWhat's next for Kirby Jenner?\n\nWell, I got a dentist appointment at 3PM today. Kinda nervous because I don't floss daily. Couple times a week, sure, but daily?! Who does that? Also, My mom stopped returning my texts so I\u2019m gonna enter this \u201cMeet Kris Jenner\u201d contest I found online to try and get ahold of her. I know she\u2019s busy tho so it\u2019s cool. Oh, and Christmas was hella awkward this year so I\u2019m thinking about starting my own reality show so I have something to talk with my family about come next holiday season. Telemundo, Adult Swim and The Game Show Network have shown interest so fingers crossed!\n\n\n\nSee more of Kirby Jenner on his Instagram account.\n\nRelated:\n\nDrone Vandalism Is Here and Its First Victim Is Kendall Jenner\n\nArt Insta of the Week: Emoji Caitlyn Jenner\n\nYou Can Hire a Personal Instagram Photographer to Travel with You\n\nTake Your Instagram Lurking to the Next Level", "description": "Who is Kirby Jenner?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://creators-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/no-slug/6098df19a392d33cdf7932a37cda98a2.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7512583892617449xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2016-01-07"}
