The big question that still lingers is how long he\u2019ll remain in town.\n\nThe Wizards offered Beal a three-year extension in July, but on a podcast published Thursday Beal said he hasn\u2019t deliberated on whether to sign it quite yet. He has until Oct. 21 to sign, but if he declines, he still has two years left on his contract.\n\n\u201cHonestly you might slap me, but I haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d Beal told NBC Sports Washington\u2019s Chris Miller. \u201cI\u2019m just getting better and letting my agent, Tommy and everybody else deal with it. I just go hoop. Every day I see somebody and they ask, \u2018Beal, you leaving?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m still living in D.C., I ain\u2019t going nowhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nSheppard said he wasn\u2019t worrying about if and when Beal agrees to an extension.\n\n\u201cI take my cues by how he\u2019s interacting,\u201d Sheppard said at his preseason press conference Thursday. \u201cWe get all these young players and I bring them in and we start talking and I say, \u2018The only thing I\u2019m gonna ask you, all you have to do is work as hard as Bradley Beal.\u2019 Sounds easy, and then you come in and you see all the work Bradley puts in every day and the leadership that he exudes every day. He\u2019s shown time and time again how committed he is to D.C.\u201d\n\nThe offer is worth $111 million, but even that amount of money might not be enough if Beal were to decide he wants to play for a championship contender and requests a trade. Teams reportedly approached the Wizards earlier this year with interest in acquiring Beal.\n\nBut Beal will be present when the Wizards begin training camp Tuesday. Many players have been in town for a few weeks to work out at the team facility. Among them is injured point guard John Wall, who continues to recover from surgery to repair his Achilles tendon.\n\nSheppard said coach Scott Brooks \u201chas kind of made him an assistant coach\u201d at offseason workouts.\n\n\u201c(Wall) has got some people he\u2019s gonna be responsible for. I think anybody that\u2019s ever sat with John, he\u2019s a basketball savant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Wizards applied for a disabled player exception for Wall, which, with some restrictions, essentially would grant them a temporary extra roster spot while he is out.\n\nIn the meantime, Sheppard said Wall is \u201cdoing fantastic.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s in a place right now where it reminds me of a kid that can\u2019t go out and play,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cHe\u2019s watching all these pick-up games and he\u2019s over on the elliptical or he\u2019s running or he\u2019s working out, and you can just see how much it physically pains him to miss playing games.\u201d\n\nWall potentially could miss the whole 2019-20 season. With that in mind, some analysts pegged the Wizards as a bottom-five team in their offseason NBA power rankings.\n\nSheppard said measuring the team\u2019s success in his first year on the job will come down to player development.\n\n\u201cWatching the players on our roster every time and being able to measure and watch, and it\u2019s not just by a stat sheet. It\u2019s all the things that you\u2019re asked to do on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking players to be stars in their role, essentially, right? You got some guys that the only time the ball\u2019s coming to you is the end of the shot clock. So we\u2019re asking you to set great screens. We\u2019re asking you to be a selfless, help-side defender. We can evaluate that and see if you\u2019re doing those things.\u201d\n\nThe general manager also mentioned that the Wizards won\u2019t need to monitor rookie Rui Hachimura\u2019s minutes in camp and the preseason. The first-round draft pick played for Japan in the FIBA World Cup this summer but dropped out of the team\u2019s final two games due to \u201cknee discomfort and general fatigue.\u201d But that\u2019s not expected to be a concern going forward.\n\nHachimura has become a star in his home country. Sheppard traveled to watch him play some exhibition games with Team Japan in Tokyo this summer.\n\n\u201cThey were sold out, and they definitely weren\u2019t there to see the other team,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThere were No. 8 jerseys everywhere. So he\u2019s got a following in Japan and it\u2019s only going to grow.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
