Higgins was found not guilty of one count of indecent assault in 1992 and the Crown Prosecution Service did not present evidence in the other cases and a not guilty verdict was recorded. Double jeopardy exceptions for compelling new evidence are only made in 30 serious crimes and Dean Radford, who first came forward to allege abuse by Higgins in 1989, has launched a petition to include child sex abuse among those \u201cserious crimes\u201d that could be retried.", "description": "A campaign to include child sexual abuse among those \u201cserious crimes\u201d for which suspects can be retried gathered momentum on Monday with the backing of former footballers and a series of charities.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000198261457-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
