Sixth mass shooting in America. 53 killed in August. Adding pressure to the white house and congress to act on guns as they return from summer break. Terry Moran is back with the latest on that. Good morning, Terry. Reporter: If it seems like you've seen this movie in Washington you have. With congress comin bag there may be an opportunity and white house aides say the president does want to get something done, the question is, what? President trump is back in Washington and he's saying this latest attack hasn't affected his approach to combating gun violence. This really hasn't changed anything. We're doing a package and we'll see what it all -- how it comes about. Reporter: The details of that package are still unclear after more than 50 Americans were killed in mass shootings in the month of August alone. Trump claims legislative action is already in the works between the white house and congress. We're looking at a lot of different things. We're looking at a lot of different bills, idea, concepts. Reporter: The president has been sending mixed messages in the wake of the Dayton and el Paso shootings he sounded supportive. We need meaningful background checks. Reporter: Now it sounds like he's backtracking? Going back even five or six or seven years, for the most part as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it. Reporter: Democratic presidential contenders are blasting him. The biggest lies he told include that he would do something about universal background checks. If we're not able to speak clearly, if we're not able to act decisively then we will continue to have this kind of blood shed in America. Reporter: The real challenge for president trump is his most loyal supporters are the most suspicious of background checks and so when he's told by his white house political aides or the national rifle association that he will lose support in 2020 if he supports background checks, so far he backs down. George. Been a pretty consistent thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "President Trump said legislative action on gun control was already in the works but remains vague on details, saying,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190902_gma_pres2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
