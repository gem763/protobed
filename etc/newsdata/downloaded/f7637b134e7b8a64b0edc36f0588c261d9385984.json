Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of $1.42 a share.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $1.47 a share, surpassing the $1.43 a share analysts polled by FactSet expected.\n\nNet revenue, meanwhile, increased 13% to $6.14 billion, beating analysts' $6.08 billion projection.\n\nPayments volume, adjusted for foreign-currency fluctuations, was up 9% for the quarter. Meanwhile, volume from cross-border transactions, which typically carry larger fees, rose 7%.\n\nThe San-Francisco-based company paid $1.69 billion during the quarter in client incentives, which are long-term contracts with merchants, clients and other partners to expand its network and payment volume.\n\nThis year, Visa projects incentives to eat away about 22.5% to 23.5% of gross revenue, higher than the previous year.\n\nThe quarterly results included a $370 million charge tied to the proposed settlement of a long-running antitrust lawsuit with merchants over the fees they pay when they accept card payments.\n\nVisa ended the year on Sept. 30 at a $12.08 billion profit with $22.98 billion in net revenue, up 11.5% from the previous year.\n\nThe company said it expects profit, on a per-share basis, to increase by a percentage in the midteens and revenue to increase by a low double-digit percentage.\n\nThursday's was the first earnings report since Visa pulled out of Facebook Inc.'s cryptocurrency-based payments network. Visa and other financial companies that Facebook had recruited, including Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., backed out of the libra project following a backlash from U.S. and European government officials regarding financial stability and data privacy. The libra project promised access to billions of potential customers -- and fees for the card networks.\n\nVisa didn't address the libra project Thursday.\n\nShares, which have been trading near record levels, closed Thursday at $176.16.\n\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 18:47 ET (22:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
