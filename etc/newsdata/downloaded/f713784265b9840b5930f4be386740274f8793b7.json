He shook all of our hands again. I was last in line, it was actually him that took my hand and I squeezed it very tight.\n\n\"I said to him, \u2018If this was your son, surely you\u2019d be doing the same thing and be trying to get justice for him?\u2019 And he agreed with me and he said, \u2018Yes, yes I would\u2019.\n\n\"I said, \u2018So please, please just do the right thing, just please try\u2019 and he squeezed my hand back and he said he would try to push another way forward, sorry, try and \u2018look at this from another angle\u2019 was what he said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t really know what he meant by that, I don\u2019t know what timescale or whatever other angle he\u2019s going to look into. It felt sincere enough for me to be able to feel we\u2019d come out with a little positive.\n\n\"But if I\u2019m totally honest, I don\u2019t hold out too much hope that she\u2019s going to be returned to us in the UK.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCharlotte added: \"I think we\u2019re just going to just be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to us as to why on earth this should be allowed to happen. It should have been a very clear-cut case.\n\n\"But we promised Harry that night in the hospital after we lost him, we stayed with him for as long as we could, and we promised that we\u2019d try and get justice for him thinking it was going to be simple. We didn\u2019t embark on this without putting some really good thought into it. He would have done the same for anyone of us.\n\n\"We owe it to him to honour him and do our absolute best to get justice for Harry. If that doesn\u2019t come in the way we want it, we will continue to work and we will try and get those diplomatic laws looked at.\"\n\n(Image: SKY NEWS)\n\nRadd Seiger, the Dunn family spokesperson, explained they had lots of legal options.\n\nHe added: \u201cBe under no illusion that we have a number of legal options open to us to try and get justice for Harry. We don\u2019t want to do that, but behind the scenes, there is an awful lot of work going on preparing major legal proceedings on both sides of the Atlantic. We strongly believe this lady did not have immunity, she should not have gone and she should come back.\u201d\n\nAsked if she could speak to Anne mother-to-mother and what she\u2019d say, Charlotte said: \u201cI would just ask her to get on the plane and do the humane thing, do the right thing, set her children a good example.\n\n\u201cShe needs to do the right thing and make that decision herself to get back on the plane and come back to the UK and meet us on UK soil and face what she\u2019s actually done.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter after the interview to praise Charlotte.\n\nOne viewer said: \"What powerful heartbreaking TV. The way Harry\u2019s Mum spoke. Come on @realDonaldTrump get Anne Sacoolas back to the UK\"\n\nAnother added: \"Watching the interview on #gmb with Harry Dunn\u2019s mum and it\u2019s heartbreaking!\"\n\nA third said: \"Harry Dunn's mum on #gmb.What a brave and superb woman and mother.This family deserve justice.\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The US President gave Charlotte Charles hope of a 'little positive' outcome after she pleaded for justice after the death of her 19-year-old son", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589274.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18591JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
