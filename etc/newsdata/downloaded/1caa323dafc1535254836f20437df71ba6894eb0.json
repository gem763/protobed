Yes. A huge dick is in her hands. I cannot make this shit up.\n\nHoly Family or, as I like to call it, Holy Shit That\u2019s A Large Dique, is currently on display at Griffith University Art Gallery in Brisbane as part of their new The Abyss exhibition.\n\nBut it may not remain on display if local church groups and the Australian Christian Lobby have a say in the matter.\n\n\u201cAs a publicly funded institution, Griffith has a moral obligation to the community they serve,\u201d Australian Christian Lobby Queensland Director Wendy Francis said. \u201cNo one denies that we all have different views of what is acceptable or not in art. It can be explicit and challenging, but an image such as this, which humiliates and defiles one of the most famous women in history, does not belong in a public university.\u201d\n\nBut according to the artist\u2019s agent, this is a pretty normal concept for Davila to tackle.\n\n\u201cTo try to remove a work from an exhibition is the tactics of a dictatorship rather than a democracy,\u201d Agent Kalli Rolfe said. \u201cJuan Davila is one of Australia\u2019s most revered and prominent artists.\u201d\n\nThe doodle is owned by a Brisbane couple, and I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s quite the conversation start when they have friends over for dinner. They\u2019ve loaned it to the gallery to be a part of the exhibition, because honestly, everyone deserves a chance to look at this masterpiece.\n\nThankfully, Griffith University has no plans to take down the artwork and have released a statement on artistic freedom to the press.\n\n\u201cArt exhibited at the Museum can at times be, confronting and challenging, but always thought-provoking,\u201d Professor Scott Harrison said. \u201cUpon entry to the exhibition there are clear signs stating that the exhibition contains graphic content with nudity and depictions of violence.\n\nDavila\u2019s artwork has been displayed all across Australia and the world, including the MET in New York and Melbourne\u2019s NGV.\n\nUnfortunately, because I\u2019d like to keep my job and not get the entire website banned from the internet, I\u2019m not going to post the graphic version. But if you want to see the schlong in all of it\u2019s artistic glory, you can definitely find it online.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/holyfam-e1567671839919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
