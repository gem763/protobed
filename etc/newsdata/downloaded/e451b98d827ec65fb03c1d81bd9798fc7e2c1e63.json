It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u201cPeople have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important. But that\u2019s people respecting each other\u2019s views as well. I keep saying: do not mistake democracy for division. It isn\u2019t \u2013 what we\u2019re having is an honest debate.\u201d\n\nBefore a crucial vote on Monday on whether the party should explicitly back remain in any election, Labour\u2019s autumn conference descended into rows over its Brexit policy, with rebellious MPs privately threatening another leadership challenge.\n\nCorbyn moved to stamp his authority on Labour\u2019s Brexit position by proposing a delay to deciding how the party should campaign at a second referendum.\n\nMcDonnell said he wanted Labour to continue to promise an EU renegotiation, followed by a second referendum, if it wins the next election.\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, when we know what the deal is, we\u2019ll have a special conference and then determine our position. It\u2019s very difficult for people to determine their position in advance of knowing the detail of that deal, but my view, actually I think, because I campaigned for remain, I can\u2019t see at the moment a better deal being achieved. And that\u2019s my view.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying I\u2019m happy to go along with this logical sequence. And I\u2019m happy for others to challenge me and say: \u2018Actually, no, this is a better deal.\u2019 I\u2019d like that debate. \u201c\n\nMcDonnell also described the decision of Andrew Fisher, a key aide to the leader, to quit the post as the result of \u201ca bad day at the office\u201d.\n\nFisher, who masterminded the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, said he no longer had faith that Labour would be successful. According to the Sunday Times, he said in a memo to colleagues that members of Corbyn\u2019s team had a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d.\n\n\u201cSometimes you are going to have a bad day at the office. Sometimes your colleagues are going to drive you up the wall,\u201d said McDonnell, who added that Fisher was one of his closest friends and that he would attempt to persuade him to remain in the role.", "description": "Shadow chancellor rejects claims of \u2018civil war\u2019 in Labour ranks over Brexit policy", "authors": ["Ben Quinn", "Andrew Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1109c13a1ee5881c3980c628448a9a3aafeeb5c5/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c73af86688b681f681052413afe863cb", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
