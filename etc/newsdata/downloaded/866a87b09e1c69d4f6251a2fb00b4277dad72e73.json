This won't end well", "language": "en", "text": "Do Americans still have a government? I do not know. What I do know is that President Trump and the upper echelons of the executive branch are at war with the legislative branch, the rule of law, the constitution, federal civil servants and the American people. It\u2019s a conflict that pulls in many directions, and if the president threatened civil war the other day as something that could happen if he doesn\u2019t get his way, we can regard the ordinary state of things as a low-intensity civil war or a slo-mo coup that\u2019s been going on from the beginning. Tuesday\u2019s White House refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry only escalates their defiance and their chaos.\n\nThe chaos takes so many forms. Innumerable stories have made it clear that even the president\u2019s own aides and cabinet members treat him like a captive bear or a person having a psychotic breakdown \u2013 like someone unstable who must be kept from harming himself and others. They have done that by heaping on the flattery, and by warping and limiting the information he receives, and often by doing their best to prevent his directives from being realized.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported on a March meeting about the border. According to aides, Trump \u201csuggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down\u201d. When he was told that wasn\u2019t allowed, he ordered that the border be closed. That set off a \u201cfrenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time. By the end of the week, the seat-of-the-pants president had backed off his threat but had retaliated with the beginning of a purge of the aides who had tried to contain him.\u201d\n\nPassivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out\n\nThis is the kind of story we\u2019ve become used to \u2013 outrages and viciousness and inanity and all \u2013 but it\u2019s worth reading another way, as a story about a bear lashing out at whatever\u2019s around him and gobbling up the scraps they feed him while he is still chained to the wall. When we refer to the \u201cpresident\u201d we really mean whatever ad hoc group of people with proximity is manipulating him, lying to him, or preventing him from knowing or doing something. They sometimes prevent harm or illegality. But this is only half of the administrative \u201cteam.\u201d The other half consists of those serving his personal agenda, and in this respect the federal government has become a subsidiary of Trump Incorporated.\n\nWilliam Barr is supposed to be this nation\u2019s attorney general, whose job the Judiciary Act of 1789 defined as \u201cto give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States.\u201d But Barr has been bouncing all over the globe pushing the president\u2019s self-serving conspiracy theories and smears of rival candidates, a stunning violation of his role.\n\nMike Pompeo, the secretary of state, took an oath to \u201csupport and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and has since become one of those enemies in service of others. He was on the July phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and discredit the story of the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. The leverage for this request seems to have been the hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid \u2013 taxpayer dollars \u2013 withheld by President Trump at the time.\n\nThe Guardian reported a few days ago that Pompeo \u201cdismissed summonses from Democratic committee chairmen in the House of Representatives for five current and former state department officials to testify on the president\u2019s attempts to push Ukraine to dig up dirt on his leading political rival.\u201d And Tuesday, Pompeo\u2019s State Department blocked former ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who\u2019s implicated in the Ukrainian shakedown, from testifying to Congress, a clear and open obstruction of justice.\n\nThe phrase \u201cparty over country\u201d has been used to describe Republicans for years, but at this point it\u2019s more or less puppet over country, because the loyalty is to Trump\u2019s corrupt, delusional, floundering endeavors to keep himself in power and out of trouble with the law. Trump\u2019s own loyalties are to himself, his profits, and his next political campaign\u2014and perhaps to Vladimir Putin, before whom he grovels regularly, and whose agenda he has served even with this undermining of our relationship with Ukraine and the search for evidence to exonerate Russia in the 2016 election.", "description": "At the top there\u2019s corruption, down below there\u2019s dismantling and disarray.
