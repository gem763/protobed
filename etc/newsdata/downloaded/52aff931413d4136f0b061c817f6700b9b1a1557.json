Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, tweeted he was \u201cstill waiting for @Nike & their stable of \u2018woke\u2019 social-justice warrior/athletes to speak out.\u201d\n\nNike\u2019s low profile also comes in stark contrast to its decision in July to yank shoes featuring the Betsy Ross flag after Mr. Kaepernick reportedly complained that the 13-star image was offensive.\n\nWith a few exceptions, however, most of the blowback has been directed at the NBA and, more recently, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, who unleashed a social-media outcry by telling reporters Monday that Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation.\u201d\n\nLike other companies heavily invested in China, \u201cNike is playing the long game,\u201d said Dan Gainor, vice president of business and culture at the conservative Media Research Center.\n\n\u201cThey know Americans are distracted by a bazillion things, and they\u2019re assuming they can weather the storm,\u201d Mr. Gainor said. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly what the NBA is doing. Would it surprise me to know that Nike is talking to the NBA and say, how can we weather this together? Not at all.\u201d\n\nAs far as Fox Sports host Jason Whitlock is concerned, Nike is calling the shots, saying that, \u201cThe NBA answers to Nike. Basketball exists to sell shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNike is the real bully in the ring here. They are influencing American culture. They are addicted to the market in China,\u201d said Mr. Whitlock on Fox\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got 1.4 billion people over there that Nike needs to sell shoes to.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Nike\u2019s stock price rose by 1.86% over the last five days as analysts predicted that the $37 billion company would sail through the storm with its business relationship with China firmly intact.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s much ado about nothing,\u201d Susquehanna equity analyst Sam Poster told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \u201cNike is a huge brand. It\u2019s been in China for 30 years. Every check we\u2019ve done over the years has been that the Chinese consumer thinks of Nike as a global brand and doesn\u2019t think of it as a U.S. brand.\u201d\n\nCriticizing Morey\n\nWhether the same can be said of U.S. consumers is another issue. Both the right and left have slammed the NBA for its less-than-courageous to the crackdown, which saw state-controlled Chinese television and sponsors launch a Houston Rockets boycott.\n\nMeanwhile, about 200 protesters in Hong Kong burned and trampled James jerseys Tuesday while chanting a message that \u201cwasn\u2019t printable,\u201d the AP reported.\n\nThe Lakers star had also shown support for Mr. Kaepernick, posting the Nike ad on Instagram, after the former NFL quarterback refused to stand for the national anthem. Both men have contracts with Nike.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to stick up for what you believe in,\u201d James told reporters in February. \u201cI stand with Kap. I kneel with Kap.\u201d\n\nSen. Rick Scott, Florida Republican, tweeted Tuesday that it was \u201csad to see him joining the chorus kowtowing to Communist China and putting profits over human rights for #HongKong,\u201d while Sen. Josh Hawley called James\u2019s comment on Morey \u201cgarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving just been in Hong Kong\u2014on the streets & with the protestors\u2014this kind of garbage is hard to take,\u201d tweeted the Missouri Republican. \u201cLeBron, are YOU educated on \u2018the situation\u2019? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties.\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee predicted the NBA would relocate to China \u201cso Nike can make even MORE money with the Commies. They can spew any anti-American stuff they want as long as they don\u2019t criticize China.\u201d\n\nThe episode has focused attention on the pro-democracy protests as well as human-rights abuses in China, where an estimated 1.5 million Uighur Muslims have undergone detention and reeducation for \u201cextremist thoughts\u201d since 2016 in Xinjiang.\n\nJames later tweeted that the NBA and his team \u201cjust went through a difficult week,\u201d which left sportscaster and former NBA player Len Elmore \u201ca bit flabbergasted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to hurt his brand domestically, but the bottom line is, going forward, this is going to make people very skeptical when guys speak out for social justice, looking at placing a dollar sign on it,\u201d Mr. Elmore said on Fox Business.\n\nU.S. companies in China must walk a fine line to avoid offending the communist government, and in Nike\u2019s case, billions are at stake. Nike footwear sales alone in 2018 were $4.26 billion in China, which has an estimated 300 million recreational basketball players.\n\nLast month, Nike won a Creative Arts Emmy for its Kaepernick ad, released to coincide with the opening of the 2018 NFL regular season. Despite some pushback from Kaepernick critics, the Oregon-based company saw sales rise last year by 36%.\n\nMr. Kaepernick has become something of a full-time social-justice advocate since the 2016 season \u2014 he settled a grievance with team owners alleging they colluded to keep him out of the NFL \u2014 but so far he has not commented publicly on Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Colin Kaepernick?\u201d asked Mr. Gainor. \u201cYou\u2019re the king of protests. You wear socks that show cops as pigs. Meanwhile, you have an autocratic nation that is mistreating millions, and is really one of the worst nations on earth, and where are you on your social critique?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
