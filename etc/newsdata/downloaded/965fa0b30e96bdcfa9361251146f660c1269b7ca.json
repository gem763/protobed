Today: James Spittal, CEO & Founder of Web Marketing ROI.\n\nCurrent gig: CEO & Founder of Web Marketing ROI\n\nCurrent location: South Yarra, VIC, Australia\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone X\n\nCurrent computer: Macbook Air (when on the go)\n\nOne word that best describes how you work: Fast\n\nWhat apps/software/tools can't you live without?\n\nSlack, Sublime, SSH and *nix.\n\nWhat social network do you find the most useful?\n\nLinkedIn.\n\nWhat were the most important lessons you learned while growing your business?\n\n1. Focus is everything: to grow a business its essential to determine what you do best and focus solely on that. Double-down on your assets and you\u2019re much more likely to be successful.\n\n2. Satisfy your customers and clients: it might sound obvious, but this is a step many companies overlook. Delighted customers and clients are the reason we\u2019re in business. Don\u2019t assume they\u2019re happy: measure it. Use NPS customer satisfaction scores (or similar tools) and review regularly, then take corrective action to improve customer experience.\n\n3. Set higher long-term goals: you are likely to underestimate what you can achieve long term. In the words of Bill Gates, \u201cmost people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.\u201d Set the goals higher and who knows where your business or career will be.\n\nWhat has been the most surprising part of your business journey?\n\nIf you had told me eight years ago, when we were starting out, that we\u2019d be running testing and personalisation for the biggest names in Australia, I\u2019d have thought you were mad. Our business growth has also surprised us.\n\nWhat everyday thing are you better at than anyone else?\n\nHaving the humility to test ideas. Testing is the core of everything we do at Web Marketing ROI and the reason why we, and our clients, have been so successful. Making decisions without evidence means making guesses and we don\u2019t like to guess.\n\nWhat's your sleep routine like?\n\nMy routine varies dramatically depending upon whether I\u2019m travelling or home in Melbourne. When I can, I like to set the alarm for 5 or 6am and listen to an educational audiobook or podcast for an hour. Generally, then, I try to be in bed by around 10pm to give myself plenty of sleep. Being a business owner, however, means accepting the reality of operating on a couple of hours of sleep when it\u2019s needed too.\n\nWhat advice would you offer to other businesses on how to succeed?\n\nPersistence might seem cliche, but frankly I\u2019ve found it essential. To make meaningful progress and create value in business, you must persist well beyond the estimates of others. Therefore, to be successful, you must be clear on your vision and dogged in reaching it. That, at least, is what\u2019s worked for me.", "description": "How I Succeeded is a regular series on Lifehacker where we ask business leaders for the secrets and tactics behind their success.
