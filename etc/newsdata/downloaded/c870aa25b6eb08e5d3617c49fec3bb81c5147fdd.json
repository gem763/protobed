REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nTheir families are some of the poorest in the hamlet of Mukundwadi, in the western state of Maharashtra, a village that has suffered back-to-back droughts.\n\nIndia\u2019s monsoons have brought abundant rain and even floods in many parts of the country, but rainfall in the region around Mukundwadi has been 14% below average this year and aquifers and borewells are dry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to spend time bringing water, but I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Dhage said.\n\n\u201cThis is my daily routine,\u201d said Garud. Their cramped shanty homes are just 200 meters (220 yards) from the train station. \u201cAfter coming from school, I don\u2019t get time to play. I need to get water first.\u201d\n\nFor a photo essay, please click: reut.rs/2mlcXtf\n\nThey are not alone. Millions of Indians do not have secure water supplies, according to the UK-based charity, WaterAid. It says 12% of Indians, or about 163 million people, do not have access to clean water near their homes - the biggest proportion of any country.\n\nFor an interactive graphic on India's depleting water resources, please click tmsnrt.rs/2mgof1L\n\nRecognizing the issue, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to spend more than 3.5 trillion rupees ($49 billion) to bring piped water to every Indian household by 2024.\n\nMore than 100 families in Garud and Dhage\u2019s neighborhood do not have access to piped water and many depend on private water suppliers, who charge up to 3,000 rupees ($42) for a 5,000-litre tanker during summer months.\n\nBut private water supply is something Garud and Dhage\u2019s parents say they can not afford.\n\n\u201cNowadays, I don\u2019t get enough money to buy groceries. I can\u2019t buy water from private suppliers,\u201d said Dhage\u2019s father, Rahul, a construction worker. \u201cI am not getting work every day.\u201d\n\nPIPE DREAM\n\nThe children take the train daily to fetch water from the nearby city of Aurangabad.\n\nThe train is often overcrowded, so a group of small children jostling to get on board with pitchers to fill with water is not always welcome.\n\n\u201cSome people help me, sometimes they complain to railway officials for putting pitchers near the door. If we don\u2019t put them near the door, we can not take them out quickly when the train stops,\u201d Dhage said.\n\nGarud\u2019s grandmother Sitabai Kamble and an elderly neighbor help occasionally by pushing them on board in the face of irritable passengers.\n\n\u201cSometimes they kick the pitchers away, they grumble,\u201d Kamble said.\n\nWhen the train pulls into Aurangabad thirty minutes later, they scramble to fill the pitchers at nearby water pipes. Garud can\u2019t reach the tap, so she relies on her taller sister, Aaysha, 14, and grandmother.\n\nOthers, like Anjali Gaikwad, 14, and her sisters, also board the train every few days to collect water and wash clothes.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nTheir neighbor Prakash Nagre often tags along with soap and shampoo. \u201cThere\u2019s no water to bathe at home,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen the train returns them to Mukundwadi, they have just under a minute to disembark. At times, Dhage\u2019s mother, Jyoti, is waiting at the station to help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m careful, but sometimes pitchers fall off the door in the melee and our work is wasted,\u201d she said, holding her infant in one arm and a pitcher in the other. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my daughter at home alone so I have to take her along.\u201d", "description": "As their classmates set off to play after school each day, nine-year-old Sakshi Garud and her neighbor Siddharth Dhage, 10, are among a small group of children who take a 14-km (9-mile) return train journey from their village in India to fetch water.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433531374&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N2FX", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
