But this latest research shows polystyrene is the perfect shape and size to catch certain frequencies of sunlight.\n\nSunlight doesn\u2019t cause the plastic to just physically break down, it also causes it to degrade chemically into dissolved organic carbon and traces of carbon dioxide, according to the paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters.\n\nScientists placed five commercially available polystyrene samples in water and exposed them to simulated sunlight three times brighter than that at the equator.\n\nThe study found all the samples partially oxidised into dissolved organic carbon. This means its original form disappears from the environment and turns into by-products that are invisible to the naked eye.\n\n\u201cWe used multiple methods to do this, and they all pointed to the same outcome: sunlight can transform the polystyrene into carbon dioxide,\u201d said Dr Ward. \u201cBut we need more research to understand what happens to the other products that dissolve into water.\u201d\n\nScientists believe for latitudes 0\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 N (from the equator to the southern border of Canada), this process would take decades. For complete oxidation to carbon dioxide, it would take centuries, they say.\n\nAdditives that determine polystyrene\u2019s colour, flexibility, and other physical features change the speed of degradation.\n\nEarlier this year, the president of Costa Rica announced a total ban on polystyrene due to its environmental impact. This will come into effect in 2021.\n\nCarlos Alvarado Quesada said it was necessary to make a change \u201cin our minds, but also in our actions\u201d to protect nature and human health.", "description": "Polystyrene degrades much faster than previously thought \u2013\u00a0breaking down in decades or centuries when exposed to sunlight, a\u00a0study has found.
