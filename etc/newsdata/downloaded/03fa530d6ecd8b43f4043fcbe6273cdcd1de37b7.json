More. 24 email sign-offs to avoid \u2014 plus the perfect one to use every time\n\nReported by Jacquelyn McKee\n\nWriting an email isn't so hard, but figuring out how to sign off can be a real challenge.\n\nIs \"cheers\" too casual? Too pretentious? Too British? Is \"sincerely\" timeless and professional, or stodgy and overly formal?\n\nPerhaps, as Matthew J.X. Malady persuasively argued at Slate, we should just call the whole thing off and ditch the email closer altogether.\n\nBut as anyone who has sat staring blankly at a screen, weighing \"best\" vs. \"all best\" vs. \"all the best\" knows, not signing off doesn't feel quite right, either - especially if the context is professional. Ending the note abruptly can make you seem rude.\n\nRead more: I've been hiring people for 10 years, and I still swear by a simple rule: If someone doesn't send a thank-you email, don't hire them.\n\nSo, if we accept - at least for the moment - that email sign-offs are here to stay, the question becomes which one to use, and in what contexts to use it.\n\nWe had experts weigh in on 25 common email closings. Here are the ones they say to avoid in most situations - and which one to use when you're just not sure.\n\nSign-offs to avoid:\n\n'TTYL,' 'TAFN,' etc.\n\nAvoid slang and acronyms, like TTYL (\"talk to you later\") or TAFN (\"that's all for now\"). These are unprofessional and confusing.\n\n'Peace out' or 'Later'\n\nThese are way too informal for work-related communications.\n\n'Love'\n\nThis is inappropriate at work. Even if you're friendly with the person you're emailing, skip it.\n\n'xx' or 'xoxo'\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" business etiquette expert Barbara Pachter tells Business Insider. It's just not professional.\n\nBut Will Schwalbe, who co-authored \" SEND: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better\" with David Shipley, says that it has become \"remarkably accepted even in casual (very casual) business correspondence.\" That said, it's best to only use in reply to someone else who is already using. Don't initiate.\n\n'Yours'\n\n\"I never understood this one,\" Aliza Licht, author of the career guide \" Leave Your Mark,\" tells Business Insider. \"'Yours' what?\"\n\nIf you are going to use it, though, Schwalbe says that it's one of the more formal options, though it's not quite as formal as \"sincerely.\"\n\n'Yours truly'\n\nLicht says it strikes her as \"fake.\"\n\n'Yours faithfully'\n\n\"I always assume it's going to be a marriage proposal,\" Pachter says. Don't use it.\n\n- [your name]\n\nLicht and Schwalbe agree that it's \"cold\" and \"abrupt.\"\n\n[nothing at all]\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, not signing an email at all can feel weird. Although, it's \"absolutely fine as a chain progresses,\" Schwalbe says.\n\nPratcher agrees, saying once a conversation is underway, she approves of getting rid of both the salutation and the close.\n\nRead more: This LinkedIn message took 2 minutes to write and got the sender a job at a successful startup - even though they weren't hiring\n\nSign-offs that are fine - but not the best:\n\n'Thanks' or 'Thanks again'\n\n\"Fine if it's for a favor the person has done, but obnoxious if it's a command disguised as premature gratitude,\" Schwalbe says.\n\nLicht agrees. It \"comes off as not really that thankful,\" she says. While it doesn't particularly bother Pachter, the consensus is that you can probably do better. Skip.\n\n'Sincerely'\n\n\"Is this a cover letter? Because otherwise, no,\" says Licht.\n\n\"Very formal, and could seem cold if it follows more intimate sign-offs,\" Schwalbe says.\n\nBut Pachter feels that it all depends on the opening salutation. If you began with \"dear,\" then \"sincerely\" is appropriate, she says.\n\n'Regards'\n\n\"Hate, hate, hate,\" says Licht, though she says that she hates the supposedly more casual abbreviated version - \"Rgds\" - even more. \"It's like you're so busy you can't even spell it.\"\n\nSchwalbe, however, doesn't mind it.\n\n\"Nice,\" he says, noting that it's \"a little formal.\" Think of it as the equivalent to the \"warm\" family, he says.\n\n'Looking forward'\n\nTotally fine, they agree - assuming you're actually going to see that person in the near future. Otherwise, skip it.\n\nRead more: 20 things you should never say to your coworkers\n\n'Talk soon'\n\nThe more casual cousin of \"speak with you soon,\" this one follows pretty much the same rules as its relative. If you actually will be talking soon, it's fine - though Licht isn't sold on it. If you don't actually plan to talk soon, it's insincere.\n\n'More soon'\n\n\"You are committing yourself to a second reply,\" Schwalbe cautions. \"Do you really want to do that? Or should you just take a moment and answer the thing properly right now?\"\n\nLicht feels even more strongly. \"Promises can be forgotten,\" she says. \"Under-promise, over-deliver.\"\n\n'Warmly' or 'Warmest'\n\nA fan of the whole \"warm\" family, Schwalbe thinks that \"warmly\" is less formal than \"sincerely,\" but a little more formal than the whole \"best\" family. Pachter likes it, too.\n\nLicht, however, is unimpressed. \"Snorefest,\" she says.\n\n'Cheers'\n\n\"It's fine,\" Pachter says, though she's not sold on it.\n\nTo Licht, it seems \"pretentious, unless you're actually British.\"\n\nSchwalbe suggests a test: Would you say it to people in person? If so, go for it. If not, skip.\n\n'Respectfully'\n\n\"A little stiff,\" Schwalbe says. \"Also, it brings to mind, for people of a certain age, Diana Ross singing 'Upside Down.'\"\n\nUnless you're addressing the US president, Licht says it's too formal.\n\nIf you do happen to be addressing POTUS, though, you're on the right track. A variation - \"respectfully yours\" - is the standard close for addressing government officials and clergy, Pachter says.\n\nRead more: 36 things you should never say to your boss\n\n'Looking forward to hearing from you'\n\nA minefield of power dynamics, this one is \"a bit presumptuous but fine if you are doing a favour for someone,\" Schwalbe says.\n\nIt's not fine, however, if you're the one asking.\n\nPlus, as Licht points out, it puts you in a \"subservient position where you can't take action but must wait for the other person's cue.\"\n\nThe winner:\n\n'Best'\n\nAll three experts agree that \"best\" is among the safest possible choices - inoffensive and almost universally appropriate.\n\nSo when in doubt, go with \"best.\"\n\nRachel Sugar contributed to a previous version of this article.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "SAA pilots want to strike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/f0b1eef9888047bc839585b2c4ad6b6b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
