It would not be shocking if hundreds, nay, thousands of people missed their flights daily because they are late or stuck somewhere or just lazy. Sometimes pre-flight rituals like drinking, snacking or smoking could also be the cause of missed flights.\n\nPassengers and attendants at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport were in for some good drama (might have been shocking for some) when a man who missed his flight, because he was busy drinking in the departure lounge, went on a rampage.\n\nThe tourist was apparently leisurely drinking at the lounge, and by the time he realised it was time for his flight, it was already too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man went cuckoo and tried to enter the locked departure gate, and the entire madness was caught on CCTV.\n\nDon't Miss 7 K SHARES 2 K SHARES 334 SHARES\n\nThe tourist vandalised the check-in desks, broke electrical equipment, and then tripped on a rope barrier (kind of proved to be the comic relief in his own violent movie). A few minutes into this, airport security officers showed up at the scene and one of them took the tourist down, wrestler style.\n\nReportedly the man was taken to the airport police station and charged with hooliganism, unsurprisingly.\n\nWell, its not only not safe to drink before driving, its clearly not safe to drink before flying either.", "description": "People missing flights because of silly reasons is not unknown.
