My husband and I did not get married in haste \u2014 we went to premarital counseling and have been together six years \u2014 but I am beginning to feel like the wool was pulled over my eyes this entire time.\n\nI have been slowly uncovering financial issues such as unpaid rent and car notes, credit card charges, and extra equipment and phone lines in my name. My husband is not being cooperative in explaining this, and I teeter between feeling like a complete idiot for allowing him to handle our finances \u2014 my career is in finance \u2014 and just completely overwhelmed and hurt.\n\nI have started the process of removing his access to my accounts, but how do I know if this is something to walk away from? Where do I start to pick up the pieces? This is not how I imagined starting out.\n\n\u2014 Falling Apart\n\nFalling Apart: Of course not. No one likes to be faked out.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/For The Washington Post)\n\nBut being faked out is not a reflection of your personal failings \u2014 it is all about his. So stop inviting in shame as another party to this already crowded problem.\n\nYou have nothing to be embarrassed about. Plus, a career in finance hardly inoculates you against fraud, especially when the fraud here appears to have been largely emotional. You were trusting because you loved him. In presenting himself as loving and trustworthy, he just managed to lie well enough to fool you. If there\u2019s any shame to feel here, it\u2019s all his.\n\nRemoving his access to your accounts is a good first step and also the model for your next ones: Specific, financial remedies first, one by one in order of greatest urgency. Lock down what you need to lock down, talk to an attorney if you haven\u2019t already, etc.\n\nThat methodical, business-first approach will eventually leave you with only the central emotional problem to deal with, by which point you presumably will feel more ready to face it: that your husband lied to you, caused you harm and apparently does not see getting caught as an opportunity to stop doing either one.\n\nHe is okay with hurting you. Is there any question, really, about whether to walk away?\n\nThe only reason to stay is when there\u2019s something to stay for, with additions greater than what someone subtracts \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to see any way to make the math work with someone subtracting love and trust.\n\nDear Carolyn: Is there any way to deal with someone who feels that your politely excusing yourself from a conversation or social gathering \u2014 because the subject matter makes you uncomfortable, because you're tired, because you need to introvert \u2014 is unspeakably rude? I'm guessing nope?\n\n\u2014 You Have to Stay!\n\nYou Have to Stay!: There is always a way to deal with someone; there just aren\u2019t always ways to make people like what you choose.\n\nExcuse yourself as you wish or must. Then, as needed, politely rebuff anyone who tries to correct you for it. As it happens, telling others how to behave is higher up on the rudeness scale than \u201cMy apologies, I have to go.\u201d", "description": "After she married, she discovered a number of financial issues with her spouse.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
