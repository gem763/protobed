That\u2019s thinking outside of the box.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Woman is brilliant and considerate. Her feet aren\u2019t exposed and the hammock can\u2019t rattle around during turbulence. She probably paid the premium to get that front row too.\"\n\nDespite the praise, others were quick to slam her invention for endangering the lives of others after the image was posted on the Passenger Shaming Facebook page.\n\n\"If it wasn\u2019t so rude, intrusive, and dangerous, it\u2019s actually a smart idea. Too bad,\" said one.\n\n\"I might have to break her legs if I need to get out that emergency exit!\" wrote another.\n\nA third commented: \"In front of the exit row door. Endangering hundreds of lives. Genius indeed.\"\n\nIt's not the first time someone has irked fellow plane passengers with their behaviour, after a man was shamed recently for choosing to dry his socks by wedging them in the shutter of the plane window.\n\nThe anonymous traveller was labelled a 'disgusting pig' as people struggled to come to terms with his bizarre decision.", "description": "Some praised the plane passenger's ingenuity for the sleeping hack while others said it was 'endangering hundreds of lives'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749384.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Womans-genius-hack-for-sleeping-on-plane-divides-opinions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
