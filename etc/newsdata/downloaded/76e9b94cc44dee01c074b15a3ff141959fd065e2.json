This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.\n\n(CNN) At MTV's Video Music Awards on Monday night, Taylor Swift used her Video of the Year acceptance speech to promote LGBTQ equality and take a swipe at President Donald Trump.\n\nHer winning video, \"You Need to Calm Down,\" features an array of LGBTQ stars and promotes a petition in support of the Equality Act , a bill that would protect LGBTQ people from many forms of discrimination. Despite some half a million signatures, Swift noted that the White House hasn't recognized the request.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere responded and said, \"The Trump administration absolutely opposes discrimination of any kind and supports the equal treatment of all; however, the House-passed bill in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.\"\n\nJill Filipovic\n\nCelebrities are rarely the best vessels for politics. Narcissism tends to be high, and genuine engagement tends to be low. And, more to the point, talent as a singer/songwriter does not translate into political sophistication.
