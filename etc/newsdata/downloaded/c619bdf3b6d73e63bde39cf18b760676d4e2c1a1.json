Gangland killings and family honour included in new BBC drama", "language": "en", "text": "Pining for Peaky Blinders now gangster brothers Tommy and Arthur Shelby are off our screens until the next series? Well don\u2019t fret: the BBC reckons it has found a perfect replacement \u2013 another gun-toting crime drama involving family honour and gang warfare.\n\nGiri/Haji, an eight-part thriller set in England and Japan with dialogue in English and subtitled Japanese, even has a pair of brothers at its heart, Kenzo and Yuto Mori.\n\nUnlike the Shelbys though, they\u2019re on different sides of the law. Kenzo is a respectable Tokyo-based detective, and Yuto is rumoured to be part of the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, and is lying low in London after allegedly murdering a Japanese businessman there.\n\nGiri/Haji, an eight-part thriller set in England and Japan with dialogue in English and subtitled Japanese, even has a pair of brothers at its heart, Kenzo and Yuto Mori. Pictured, left to right, Rodney (Will Sharpe), Taki (Aoi Okuyama), Kenzo Mori (Takehiro Hira), Sarah Weitzmann (Kelly Macdonald), Yuto (Yosuke Kubozuka)\n\n\u2018Kenzo is tasked with tracking him down and bringing him back to Japan, where the crime has had a big impact on Tokyo\u2019s gang culture,\u2019 explains Takehiro Hira, the 45-year-old Japanese actor who plays Kenzo.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s easier said than done. Yuto has disappeared so successfully that people think he\u2019s dead.\u2019\n\nIn London, Kenzo teams up with a Metropolitan Police detective named Sarah Weitzmann, played by Trainspotting\u2019s Kelly Macdonald.\n\nAs he becomes embroiled in London\u2019s underworld, shadowy businessman Abbott (Charlie Creed-Miles) tries to draw him into a web of corruption as he sets his sights on expanding his business empire into East Asia.\n\nSarah has been shunned at work after ratting on a colleague, but she becomes part of an unlikely quartet who form a shaky bond of friendship during Kenzo\u2019s visit to London.\n\nKenzo is a respectable Tokyo-based detective, and Yuto is rumoured to be part of the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, and is lying low in London after allegedly murdering a Japanese businessman there. Pictured, Takehiro Hira as Kenzo\n\nThere\u2019s also Kenzo\u2019s teenage daughter Taki and Rodney, a male escort with dyed gold hair played by Will Sharpe, who\u2019s currently starring as a pupil barrister in BBC2 comedy Defending The Guilty.\n\nRodney and Taki strike up a friendship, and viewers will see the relationship between Sarah and Kenzo blossom despite him having a wife and child back in Tokyo. \u2018Kenzo and Sarah are two lonely, damaged people who find a comfort in their relationship,\u2019 says Takehiro.\n\nThe show\u2019s title translates as Duty/Shame, referring to Kenzo\u2019s state of mind as he wrestles with those feelings.\n\nSince I started doing international jobs rather than Japanese ones, I\u2019ve been kissing like crazy. We don\u2019t have many love scenes in Japanese film or television. But you seem to take your kissing very seriously! Takehiro Hira\n\nTakehiro says he\u2019s slowly becoming accustomed to the intimate scenes he has to play in Giri/Haji.\n\n\u2018Since I started doing international jobs rather than Japanese ones, I\u2019ve been kissing like crazy,\u2019 he laughs.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have many love scenes in Japanese film or television. But you seem to take your kissing very seriously!\u2019\n\nMarried with a one-year-old daughter in real life, Takehiro could identify with his character, who has a permanent feeling of tiredness.\n\n\u2018When I saw Kenzo\u2019s description \u2013 \u201ctired, middle-aged man\u201d \u2013 I thought, \u201cThis is me, I can just be myself.\u201d\n\n'Although I couldn\u2019t see myself as a detective, not one like Kenzo who deals with his problems using violence. I\u2019m much more of a peace lover.\u2019\n\nThankfully, Yosuke Kubozuka is also a respectable distance from his character, the gangster Yuto.\n\n\u2018I learned the language someone associated with the Yakuza would be familiar with, and I know people who know people who occupy that world,\u2019 he says.\n\nThe team hopes Giri/Haji will replicate the success of Peaky Blinders, which stars Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby (pictured)\n\n\u2018I read up on the Yakuza but that\u2019s as far as my research went.\u2019\n\nWriter Joe Barton also delved into the workings of the Yakuza, an organisation with a violent history stretching back to the 17th century, but he found the inspiration for Kenzo rather closer to home.\n\n\u2018An ex-girlfriend was studying for a crime science Masters degree at University College London, and after her first day she told me about this 40-year-old Japanese guy, a detective from Tokyo, who\u2019d been sitting there in the lecture theatre.\n\n\u2018He looked completely out of place and a bit lost among all the students,\u2019 explains Joe.\n\n\u2018I thought he sounded really interesting. He stayed in the back of my head for five years before I started fleshing out a story around him.\n\nIt\u2019s an extraordinarily exciting piece. You don\u2019t find another Peaky Blinders overnight, but Giri/Haji could be it Patrick Holland\n\n'I\u2019d like to track this guy down and thank him for being the inspiration for a character in a series that hopefully runs and runs.\u2019\n\nThe BBC certainly has high hopes for the show.\n\nExecutive producers Jane Featherstone and Chris Fry were part of the team behind the award-winning Sky drama Chernobyl, and Patrick Holland, controller of BBC2, reckons the show could be the new Peaky Blinders, which started out on BBC2 before switching to BBC1.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an extraordinarily exciting piece,\u2019 he says. \u2018You don\u2019t find another Peaky Blinders overnight, but Giri/Haji could be it.\u2019\n\nFinanced partly by Netflix, it\u2019s set in the present day and was filmed in Japan and England over nine months.\n\nThe weather in both countries threw up challenges.\n\nThe production team survived a typhoon and an almost apocalyptic rainstorm in Japan, as well as Storm Gareth, a cocktail of wind and rain that conjured up 20ft waves on the Sussex coast when production moved to Hastings in March.\n\nBut the language was an even greater problem.\n\nTranslating scripts from English into Japanese was way more complicated than imagined. \u2018It was a whole layer of work that I hadn\u2019t contemplated,\u2019 admits producer Susie Liggat.\n\n\u2018You think, \u201cOK, we\u2019ll just get the script translated\u201d, but there\u2019s much more to it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Japanese is like a hologram. It\u2019s not like working in just two languages like English and French or German.\n\n'There is never a direct translation. There are different meanings to words depending on how you pronounce them, and who you\u2019re talking to.\n\n'There\u2019s a whole cultural layer that impacts on the translation. It\u2019s like Japanese operates in three dimensions, and English in two.\u2019\n\nFor the Japanese actors, the translated scripts proved a cultural eye-opener.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have swearing on Japanese TV, but there was swearing in the script,\u2019 says Takehiro.\n\n\u2018In Japan you can depict racism, but Joe\u2019s scripts had none of that. We make fun of foreigners in our programmes, but you don\u2019t in yours.\u2019\n\nFar from making fun, Susie and her team had to show respect to their hosts when filming in Japan.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s imperative in Japanese society that you do not disturb your neighbour and impose upon them,\u2019 she explains. \u2018You have to integrate'.\n\n\u2018In the UK, you\u2019d drop letters to notify people filming was going to take place nearby.\n\n'In Japan you have to tell everyone in the whole area months in advance and accept that individuals have priority.\n\n'If someone wants to walk past when you\u2019re filming, everything has to stop.\n\n'One individual didn\u2019t want us to film on their street so, despite everyone else agreeing, we couldn\u2019t shoot there.\u2019\n\nSome of the cast didn\u2019t have to tread carefully in Japan because they didn\u2019t go there.\n\nKelly Macdonald filmed all her scenes in England. \u2018But I enjoyed plenty of Japanese/British interaction,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018When we filmed in Hastings I suggested all the cast and crew had fish and chips for lunch, because it\u2019s a traditional British dish, and insisted they all had pickled onions too, which went down well!\u2019", "description": "Giri/Haji, which roughly translates as Duty/Shame, is a new BBC show about gangland warfare, family honour and guns.
