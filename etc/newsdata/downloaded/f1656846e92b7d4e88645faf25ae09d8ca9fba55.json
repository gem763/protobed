They all held down day jobs,\u201d said Jones.\n\n\u201cBut I think the MLR is a lifeline for Canada and the United States. It\u2019s a pathway for players and coaches.\u201d\n\nJones said there were 51 Canadians contracted to MLR clubs last season. Less than 18 months ago, more than 40 were working other jobs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big step in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMLR still has a way to go. It\u2019s still in its infancy but it is certainly a pathway into the top levels.\n\n\u201cIn the long term I\u2019m sure it will get up to speed and be a good competitive competition, so that is critical.\u201d", "description": "Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the \"shop window\" and ultimately help improve the team in the long run.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434377636&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q06U-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
