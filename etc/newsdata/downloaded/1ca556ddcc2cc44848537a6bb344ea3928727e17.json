Bush, who served as Texas governor, departed the White House, 18 current or former governors have launched failed presidential bids \u2014 some more than once.\n\nVoters, though, have most recently tapped a pair off candidates \u2014 businessman Donald Trump in 2016 and first-term Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 who downplayed the importance of executive governing experience as the best preparation for the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Obama was the first senator since John F. Kennedy to win the presidency. Four of his five predecessors \u2014 Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush \u2014 had served as governors.\n\nGovernors in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary also have found themselves overshadowed by the flurry of partisan battles in Washington between Democratic lawmakers and President Trump, which have driven a lot of the news coverage.\n\n\u201cObviously, the issues that Trump is talking about are national and you have people strongly for and opposed to what he wants to do, so those issues getting debated get a huge amount of attention across the country as a whole,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll.\n\n\u201cIt is much more difficult for governors to attract national attention when the issues that are largely before voters are national,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd senators and members of the House have greater access to the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have the national media closely tracking their policy debates and conflicts with the White House. As a result, the governors on the presidential campaign trail have found themselves on the outside looking in.\n\nMaking matters worse for governors, federal election law prevents them from transferring money they raised for state-level campaigns to their presidential coffers. That puts them at a competitive disadvantage with House and Senate members, who can transfer campaign funds toward their presidential bids.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernard Sanders of Vermont have transferred millions of dollars into their 2020 campaigns.\n\nBut Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state, who made climate change the centerpiece of his campaign, and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a moderate who warned the Democratic Party against \u201csocialism,\u201d withdrew from the presidential race after it became clear they missed the cut for the third primary debate.\n\nMr. Inslee has turned his attention to running for reelection, and Mr. Hickenlooper has launched a run for the Senate against Republican incumbent Cory Gardner.\n\nMr. Bullock, meanwhile, has been trying to gain traction by making the case that governors have to act while lawmakers generally spend their time debating or looking to land rhetorical punches that could go viral, making it easier for them to excite the base and raise money. The bills they support, he said, are left for others to implement.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, governors are on the front lines, meaning that this can\u2019t just be about speeches or tweets,\u201d Mr. Bullock has said. \u201cWe actually have to get things done. We\u2019re accountable to the people that we serve. So we have to figure out ways to actually make government work. And I think that is a lot different than what we see in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nArguing that Democrats have to win the support of more moderate, heartland voters if they are to defeat Mr. Trump next year, Mr. Bullock has focused much of his attention on retail politics in Iowa, where he is scheduled to campaign Thursday and Friday. He also has warned that some of the far-left candidates in the party\u2019s crowded presidential field are running on \u201cwish-list economics.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that once could pull in a lot of support. This time, however, Mr. Bullock has barely registered in the polls.\n\nStill, his campaign says the race is a marathon, not a sprint, and is far from over.\n\n\u201cWe always planned to have a campaign that was built by organizing over time, not by hoping for a viral moment,\u201d Bullock campaign manager Jennifer Ridder said this week in a campaign memo.\n\n\u201cWhile some pundits and operatives may prefer simpler narratives of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down, voters don\u2019t always abide by the attention spans of Beltway prognosticators,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd smart campaigns don\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
