Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has since retired, sided with the liberal wing to strike it down.\n\nEarlier this year, the high court, in a 5-4 move, stopped the Louisiana law from taking effect after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the regulation, ruling against the clinic.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sided with the four Democratic-appointed justices in that move.\n\nPro-choice advocacy groups said they hope the court won\u2019t reverse course, given the new conservative majority cemented by President Trump\u2019s two Supreme Court picks.\n\n\u201cIf the rule of law means anything, it means that the court cannot sit by and watch as the lower court thumbs its nose at Supreme Court precedent and at people\u2019s constitutional rights. We hope and expect that the court will strike down this unconstitutional law, which would decimate access to abortion for people in Louisiana,\u201d said Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-life organizations welcomed the court\u2019s review, saying it will give the court a chance to weigh in on the abortion issue for the first time in three years.\n\n\u201cLouisiana\u2019s long and sordid history of dirty and dangerous abortion businesses being shuttered one by one in order to protect women from fly-by-night and dangerous abortionists should tell the Court all it needs to know, both about the legal benefits of this law and the dubious right of abortionists to sue to overturn laws designed to protect their own patients,\u201d said Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
