A home-made bomb was remotely detonated as a police car drove past on Sunday night and an officer also had his neck slashed by a protester.\n\nLam announced on 4 October that the government had invoked a colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance \u2013 last used 52 years ago \u2013 to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks, bypassing the legislature. The move sparked widespread anger and has since prompted hundreds of thousands to don masks and take to the streets in defiance of the ban.\n\nA battle for the soul of the city: why violence has spiralled in the Hong Kong protests Read more\n\nAsked whether she would consider invoking emergency powers again to introduce more measures to quell unrest, Lam said \u201cwe need very strong reasons\u201d to justify further measures, but also insisted that \u201cwe should consider every measure to end violence\u201d.\n\nChinese president, Xi Jinping, warned during his trip to Nepal on Sunday that \u201canyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,\u201d according to China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV.\n\nLam called on ordinary Hong Kong people to support the police, although the increasingly severe police beatings of protesters, media and bystanders in recent months have caused sweeping resentment. Ordinary people yell obscenities when riot police officers are seen on the streets.\n\nHong Kong: the story of one protester \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nLam said her annual policy address, scheduled for Wednesday when the legislature resumes sessions, would launch economic measures to ease the land and housing situation. Mainland Chinese officials have repeatedly said unaffordable housing and employment issues are the \u201croot cause\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s social unrest, although political scientists say economic sweeteners alone will not solve the city\u2019s political crisis.\n\nShe condemned the violent attacks on mainland Chinese businesses, shops seen as pro-Beijing, and pro-government politicians\u2019 offices. \u201cTo say these were to fight for freedom and democracy could not be further from the truth,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she said her government remained committed to holding district council elections as scheduled on 24 November, despite the unstable social situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communist party mouthpiece Xinhua news agency said \u201cHong Kong has slipped into a dangerous abyss and a critical moment\u201d and urged the business sector and civil servants to shun political neutrality, show their support for the police and refrain from \u201ccondoning the rioters\u201d for ruining the city\u2019s prosperity.", "description": "Leader says she won\u2019t condone increasingly violent acts but stops short of invoking further emergency powers", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977883cfa88d6fe74d56cb603a095a81a0c53b13/0_134_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a67c9be2d5b3d5390ec600721d41a5b2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
