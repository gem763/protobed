Mandatory Credit: Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cowboys\u2019 third straight loss, to the previously winless New York Jets on Sunday, hasn\u2019t changed the thoughts of Dallas executive vice president Stephen Jones about the future of head coach Jason Garrett.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Stephen Jones said on his radio show Monday on 105.3 The Fan. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. I think this team just needs to get a win under its belt, and I still think we can have a great year and feel good about it and feel great about Jason and his staff and feel like we\u2019ll go to work here this week and move forward.\u201d\n\nJones was echoing the sentiment of his father, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said Garrett is in no danger of losing his job.\n\nThe elder Jones said his vision of the future was shorter term, when the Cowboys host the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The teams are 3-3 and tied for first atop the NFC East.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even come close to those future-type considerations,\u201d Jerry Jones said Sunday after Dallas\u2019 24-22 loss to the Jets. \u201cI\u2019m looking at future as next week against those Eagles. I\u2019m looking next week against our division.\u201d\n\nStephen Jones said Monday he isn\u2019t faulting his players\u2019 effort.\n\n\u201cI think you turn on the tape, and our guys are playing hard. I just think go back to the word execute,\u201d Stephen Jones said. \u201cWe just have to execute better. We\u2019ve got to get off to a faster start.\n\n\u201cI know everybody is going to want to read into that and try to figure what you say when you say that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that complicated. We just have to get out there and execute and hopefully get a little more healthy as we move forward and play better.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Cowboys' third straight loss, to the previously winless New York Jets on Sunday, hasn't changed the thoughts of Dallas executive vice president Stephen Jones about the future of head coach Jason Garrett.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440944287&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E03V-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
