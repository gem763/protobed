Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nWith CITIC Telecom International Holdings yielding 6.4% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:1883 Historical Dividend Yield, September 11th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 70% of CITIC Telecom International Holdings's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. CITIC Telecom International Holdings's cash payout ratio in the last year was 46%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nIs CITIC Telecom International Holdings's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs CITIC Telecom International Holdings has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.40 times its EBITDA, CITIC Telecom International Holdings's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 4.57 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for CITIC Telecom International Holdings, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.\n\nWe update our data on CITIC Telecom International Holdings every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. CITIC Telecom International Holdings has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.084 in 2009, compared to HK$0.19 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.5% a year over that time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like CITIC Telecom International Holdings Limited (HKG:1883) tend to be popular with investors...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QOE0pFVbHxxxOl.RbJJZKg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/204e4c2aabf763350358cd8448534af1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
