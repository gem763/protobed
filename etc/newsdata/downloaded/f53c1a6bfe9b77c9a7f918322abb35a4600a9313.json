She has also held positions as a commercial real estate finance attorney at two leading Wall Street firms: Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP.\n\nWe caught up with the New Jersey-based Ms. LaTorre to discuss which areas of the world are most luxe, the best opportunities available in Europe, and more.\n\nMore: Design Firm Chief Says Luxury is About Tapping Into All the Senses\n\nMansion Global: Describe your dream property.\n\nJulie Leonhardt LaTorre: We recently bought a 1930s farmhouse in New Jersey, and we have 16 acres, which is a dream after so many years living in a city. But I\u2019d also love a luxury high-rise in London, something ultra modern. I like both extremes.\n\n\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nJLL: I lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, for 15 years and there were so many of those. The real estate market has totally exploded there.\n\n\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nJLL: To me, it\u2019s quiet, simple and understated. Clear lines, a modern feel. Everything has its purpose and place.\n\nMore: Luxury is About Inner Wellness, Says Los Angeles-Based Designer\n\n\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nJLL: Secondary cities like Austin, Nashville and Kansas City.

It hasn\u2019t replaced agents in any way. We use technology to enhance our service, but it doesn\u2019t replace the most fundamental thing\u2014relationships.\n\nFrom Penta: Guy Hands\u2019 Business and Philanthropy\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nJLL: Luxury means different things to different people, but Telluride, Colorado, is one of my favorites at the moment. It\u2019s very cosmopolitan but also beautiful.\n\n\n\nIn New York City, old, historical buildings that have been redone to feel new, like the Woolworth Tower.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, we see Portugal continue to be a place where people are looking, in part because of the Golden Visa program.\n\nSingapore is amazing for its ultra luxury, super penthouses that have a minimum of 10,000 square feet, amazing views, and are in buildings with full concierge services.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nJLL: Right now my favorite part is my chicken coop. Our chicks just started laying eggs. At the end of the day, I love to have a glass of wine and watch them run about. There\u2019s just something about a big red barn.\n\nMore: New York Real Estate Investor and Developer Says Despite Challenges, Manhattan\u2019s Market is Still a Leader\n\nMG: What best describes the theme of your home and why?\n\nJLL: I\u2019ve kept the aesthetics very simple, focused on black and white.

Even if something looks good on paper but doesn\u2019t feel right, skip it. Even if it\u2019s for investment purposes, there should be something that excites you about it.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nJLL: There are a few things.
