It is a less commoditized approach, which should give them early access to some exciting categories,\u201d the analyst wrote in a note to clients. He highlighted the company\u2019s partnership with brewer Molson Coors TAP, +0.38% as one that offers an early mover advantage in cannabis drinks.\n\nRead: Sundial sued in U.S. for failing to disclose half-ton of cannabis was returned by client\n\nKirk reiterated his buy rating on the stock and C$12 price target.\n\nIn a separate note published Thursday, Kirk said the black market in Canada is thriving a year into legalization \u2014 and that\u2019s bad news for the big licensed producers. Provinces are too slow in opening stores and the price gap with legal weed is widening.\n\nOn Wednesday, Statistics Canada released crowdsourced price data for the black and legal markets and found an average legal price in the third quarter of C$10.23 a gram, almost double the black market average price of C$5.59 a gram.\n\n\u201cWith surveyed consumers showing a strong sensitivity to price, we believe the widening of these price gaps limits the growth and addressable market for current legal product offerings. In combination with slower provincial buying and delayed Ontario openings, we still believe 3Q results for Canadian LPs will likely fall short of consensus expectations,\u201d Kirk wrote.\n\nTilray Inc.
