That, like everything else with Spurs, just gave way.\n\nThe Argentine\u2019s side were making errors so basic that it gave Bayern the confidence to try moments of the highest difficulty \u2013 and pull them off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Everything Spurs used to be known for under Pochettino. None of it they displayed here, at least by them.\n\nAnd such end product has to come from somewhere, from something deeper. Niko Kovac could point to a much more cohesive side, but there was more to it than that.\n\nSpurs had so many chances, and especially before the Bayern equaliser, only to fudge all but one. Even their goal from open play was a touch untidy, as Son beat Neuer with power rather than accuracy.\n\nThat roughness was initially reaping benefits, as it fostered the aggression that Bayern initially struggled with \u2013 symbolised in how Corentun Tolisso was felled by Dele Alli for the opening goal \u2013 but its effect was gradually eroded by the German side\u2019s sheer level of execution.\n\nThat remains one of the crucial differences in Champions League football, that composure. Bayern had looked like they were being pressed out of the game, rushed into errors, and yet you\u2019d never have thought any time they got the ball forward.\n\nThere was such conviction. All of the goals were of the highest quality, exacting and emphatic.\n\nWhat really stood out was how \u2013 in that classic European tie way \u2013 they just made the most of the minimum of space. There was a divine devastation to it.\n\nFor the equaliser, space opened for Joshua Kimmich at the edge of the box and he put it straight into the corner of the goal.\n\nFor the second, the brilliant Robert Lewandowski put it low in the other corner, while using his marker Jan Vertonghen to disguise it and just make it that bit more difficult for Hugo Lloris.\n\nFor the third, Serge Aurier just gave Gnabry that bit too much space, but could still have scarcely imagined what happened next. The young forward rode the despairing tackle, drove right through on goal with full purpose and then powered it into the bottom corner. There was never any doubt or hesitation about a single moment of his run.\n\nFor the fourth \u2013 with Spurs by then in disarray \u2013 Gnabry took full advantage of the space to so calmly take on Tolisso\u2019s through ball first-time and guide it in off the post.\n\nSpurs had just been blown out of the game, Harry Kane\u2019s fortuitous penalty barely giving them much extra force.\n\nGnabry meanwhile continued blowing everyone away, exploiting another one of Aurier\u2019s surges forward to run onto a ball over the top, supremely take it on and then so confidently taking the finish.\n\nIt was looking so easy for Bayern by then, and never more than when Lewandowski prodded the sixth.\n\nThe game had really reached that point where Spurs were so beaten they were coughing up every ball, with Bayern so on their game they were almost scoring with every ball.\n\nThere was just such a disturbing casualness to Gnabry\u2019s eventual fourth. He was yards from goal and yet the way the game was going he just thought \u201cwhy not?\u201d\n\nSpurs will be thinking what next?\n\nIt had that kind of feel.\n\nIt was that bad a day.\n\nIt was that great a performance from Bayern, and Gnabry.\n\nSpurs will now be struggling to get out of this group, but even that feels like one of the evening\u2019s lesser concerns.", "description": "A night where it looks\u00a0like it might all really start for Serge Gnabry, and a game where it\u00a0looks like it might\u00a0be coming to an end for Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur.
