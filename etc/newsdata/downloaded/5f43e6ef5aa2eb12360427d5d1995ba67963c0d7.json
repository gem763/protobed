Would you even know that that was her full name?\n\nThese were questions posed to Ty by his then-girlfriend Allie all the way back in 2015.\n\nYou see, Allie is what\u2019s known on Twitter as a \u2018stan\u2019 \u2013 essentially a superfan \u2013 of the Lemonade singer, and wouldn\u2019t accept anything less than a working knowledge of the difference between Sasha Fierce and Yonc\u00e8.\n\nAs a jokey little activity, Allie wrote out an exam paper for Ty to complete, asking him everything from Bey\u2019s full name to lyrics from her songs.\n\nOn the paper, it sarcastically said that Ty needed to get 60% to avoid being dumped by Allie, and thankfully he made it to 80% so they could continue heir relationship.\n\nThe post went viral, with over 12,500 likes, and a whole host of responses, from amusement at them having a laugh to some not being able to understand the clearly sarcastic nature of the test. The joke appears to be on them, however, as the couple recently tied the knot in a ceremony with a Beyonc\u00e9 theme running throughout.\n\nI gave my boyfriend a Beyonc\u00e9 exam to make sure we can stay together. He passed. pic.twitter.com/Lqv3VEKWFx \u2014 Allie (#1 Bigger Stan) (@Fergyonce) April 6, 2015\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been together 7 years,\u2019 Allie told Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re super similar in some ways but very different in our musical interests. We\u2019re always pranking and joking around with each other, so he wasn\u2019t surprised about the Beyonc\u00e9 exam one bit.\u2019\n\nThe couple were hanging around with friends when Allie decided to play around and see how well he knew his pop culture. Despite being a lighthearted thing, though, many people took it way too far.\n\nAllie says: \u2018He wrote his answers using his hand as a hard surface, so he gets so much flack about his handwriting. The weirdest part for him was that the Internet thought it was some super serious issue \u2013 we both got death threats from it which was so bizarre to us.\u2019\n\nDo we peep a Lemonade reference in those flowers? (Picture: Tracy Brewington Photography)\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop Allie loving Beyonc\u00e9, though, and it certainly didn\u2019t hinder their partnership. Ty is \u2018not involved at all on social media\u2019, so managed to avoid the worst of it, and seems more than happy to play along with the fandom, too, .\n\n\u2018I\u2019m such a Bey stan so I\u2019m always bringing her up,\u2019 says Allie.\n\n\u2018He has to deal with a lot when it comes to me talking about Bey but he knew what he was getting himself into when we first started dating. He\u2019s good at tuning me out.\u2019\n\nSingle Ladies was the only \u201cdo not play\u201d (Picture: @Fergyonce)\n\nSo, it was only natural that Beyonc\u00e9 featured in their wedding too. Allie and Ty got married on 5 October this year, on their 7th anniversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He gave me a Beyonc\u00e9 limit in terms of how many songs we could play,\u2019 says Allie, but apart from that, there were plenty of other nods.\n\n\u2018The wedding was about us as a couple, but Bey influences were there throughout the night. My wedding party and husband walked to Halo, I created video interludes inspired by Bey concerts, my mom made Beehive candles (for Beyhive), and ironically enough my new last name starts with a B so we had a giant cake topper with the letter B.\n\n\u2018Obviously for our name but I always tells my husband it\u2019s for Bey.\u2019\n\nThe groom walked down the aisle to Halo (Picture: Tracy Brewington Photography)\n\nBeing a stan is really no joke, and Allie says that Ty wasn\u2019t remotely surprised at the Beyonc\u00e9 elements given her previous history:\n\n\u2018He has seen how much Bey inspires my work ethic and drive, so he realizes it\u2019s a lot more than just loving someone\u2019s music\u2026\n\n\u2018The night was about us as a couple and not just Bey so we had such an amazing time.\u2019\n\nThe guests felt the same, with Allie commenting, \u2018Guests weren\u2019t surprised at all \u2013 every single person who knows me was expecting a lot of Bey elements to my wedding.\u2019\n\nBut, she did point out, \u2018Single Ladies was on our \u201cdo not play list\u201d for our DJ.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe liked it, and he put a ring on it.\n\nMORE: Where to get the best eggs in London\n\nMORE: How much sleep you need, and all your bedtime questions answered\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After Allie went viral for testing her boyfriend's Beyonc\u00e9 knowledge to continue their relationship, they've gone from strength to strength.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1111-f895_1570813063.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
