In addition, horseback riding trails wind throughout the vineyards.\n\nMore: Building on Mackinac Island, Where Horses Rule The Roads\n\nSited on west-facing slopes of the Carneros American Viticultural Area, Toyon Farm has a soil composition, coupled with adequate water from two irrigation ponds, that makes the land ideal for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay varietals. The vines on the farm produce premium grapes that are sold to a number of highly regarded wineries, including Ancien, Alpha Omega and Saintsbury.\n\nAlong with the existing 30 acres of vines, there are another 3.45 acres of plantable acres on the property.\n\n\"The setting is exquisite,\" Ms. Greer said. \"It\u2019s a very high-end neighborhood.\"\n\n\"The two ponds kind of anchor the site and they provide idyllic views,\" she said.\n\n\"You have beautiful layered views across your vineyard and the ponds and expansive views of other vineyards, with layered hills and mountains in the distance,\" Ms. Greer said.\n\nMore: Actor John Stamos Snaps up $5.75 Million House in California\n\nCar commercials have been filmed on the property, she added. \"The views are very expansive\u2014you can see for miles and miles.\"\n\nThe 4,000-square-foot Old World-inspired main house was designed by Robert Keenan and built in 1989.\n\nThe style of the house works quite well with the equestrian facility, Ms. Greer said.\n\nThe interiors were redone by Marcel Sedletzky in 1994, she said. \"He brought in some beautiful wood finishes and added a good deal of warmth to the house.\"\n\nOther design details include high ceilings, polished concrete finishes, solid mahogany doors and an entry courtyard with a tiled fountain. The cathedral-ceilinged great room has a wet bar and opens to an al fresco dining area with a wood-burning fireplace and an idyllic view.\n\nThe property is \"extremely private,\" Ms. Greer said. \"You\u2019ve got all of these great views, but you don\u2019t see any other residences.\n\nMore: Historic Manor House With Polo Field and Tennis Court Asks \u00a310 Million\n\nStats\n\nThe 4,000-square-foot house has three bedrooms, two full bathrooms and one partial bathroom.
