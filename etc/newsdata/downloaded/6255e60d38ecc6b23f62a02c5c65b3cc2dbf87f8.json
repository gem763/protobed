Scientists say the mosquito-borne illness, Eastern equine encephalitis, may be worse because of unseasonably warm temperatures. It\u2019s one of just several diseases scientists worry are being affected by climate change.\n\nThe nation\u2019s changing climate patterns are bringing heatwaves, flooding, warming waters and droughts. These in turn alter the environment and the microbes, viruses and insects that inhabit it in ways that can cause them to increase or appear in new areas and at different times than before.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to attribute any particular disease event to global warming, it\u2019s safe to say that climate change will change disease dynamics, said Erin Mordecai, a professor of biology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who studies the ecology of infectious disease\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re poised for a lot of surprises,\u201d Mordecai said.\n\nWhat to know: This flu season could be a nasty one. Get a shot now, CDC says\n\nOne is Eastern equine encephalitis virus, or EEE, which kills a third of all people who get it. A mosquito-borne virus, it tends to come in cyclical waves with large outbreaks occurring many years apart. This is the biggest outbreak since the 1950s or 1960s, said Mordecai.\n\nThere are no definitive ties to global warming in this outbreak but \u201cthis is such an emerging story there hasn\u2019t been time to research it yet,\u201d Mordecai said.\n\nWhat is known is that the mosquitoes which transmit the virus thrive in warmer temperatures and die off at the first hard frost.\n\nThat\u2019s where climate change comes in. The Earth just had its warmest September on record. The past five years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began in the 1880s, according to NASA.\n\nEarlier springs, later falls and hotter months in between contribute to higher mosquito populations and a greater chance of infection.\n\n\u201cThe longer the breeding season, the more baby mosquitoes that are going to hatch and the more your chance of getting bitten,\u201d says George Rutherford, a professor infectious disease and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nConstruction worker Dineose Vargas wipes his face at a construction site on the Duncan Canal in Kenner, Louisiana, Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2019. More\n\nEEE isn't the only disease doctors are concerned about. Other illnesses that might be getting worse because of climate change include:\n\nDengue Fever\n\nTransmitted by mosquitoes, some cases of dengue fever can result in a rare hemorrhagic form that can kill. Dengue was once known as \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d for the severe muscle and joint pain it can cause. There have been outbreaks in Hawaii, Florida and Texas. And there is some concern it might spread because of longer mosquito breeding seasons caused by warmer weather.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been dengue in southern Texas, Hawaii and Florida and there will be dengue in other places,\u201d said UCSF\u2019s Rutherford.\n\nWest Nile Virus\n\nFirst introduced to the United States in New York in 1999, West Nile virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and ticks. In a tiny percentage of cases it causes brain inflammation that can take weeks or months to recover from and sometimes causes permanent effects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. Last year, 167 people died from it, according to the CDC.\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nThe \u201ckidney stone risk belt\u201d is an area across the warmer parts of the southeastern United States were the incidence of kidney stones is higher, which researchers believe is linked to hotter temperatures. When people sweat more they produce less urine, which raises their risk for kidney stones.\n\nResearch at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas predicts that the proportion of the U.S. population living in high-risk zones for kidney stones will increase from 40% in 2000 to 56% by 2050 and to 70% by 2095.", "description": "Climate change is altering the nation's environment and the microbes, viruses and insects that inhabit it, potentially increasing where diseases are.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Weise", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DQUTvrZKcJUCqVxOmQRa7A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f4a9674c148994a024902325666b2f79", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
