His fifth. That\u2019s five babies dead.\n\n\u2018And I think I might return the favour. And I might kill you. I might end you. I\u2019mma light you on fire, bro,\u2019 he added.\n\nLogan Paul at East London press conference (Picture: Action Images via Reuters/Tom Jacobs)\n\nKSI did not immediately respond to the abortion comments but the reaction on social media was swift.\n\nMany criticised Logan for trying to shame KSI and his history with abortion.\n\nOne social media user wrote: \u2018Logan Paul bringing up abortions as a \u201cdiss\u201d to KSI. Please don\u2019t use women\u2019s *possibly traumatic* experiences as pawns to further [yo]ur shitty beef for clout.\u2019\n\nAnother tweeted: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with an abortion? It\u2019s a woman\u2019s body, it\u2019s her choice.\u2019\n\nThen another commentator wrote: \u2018Logan Paul making out that abortions are disgusting and shameful and embarrassing makes [me] feel violently sick \u2013 there are so many young girls in that audience [and] that is not what should be promoted to them.\n\n\u2018ABORTIONS ARE A RIGHT AND OUR CHOICE, not yours so don\u2019t get involved,\u2019 they added.\n\nKSI and Logan Paul on stage (Picture: KSI/YouTube)\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Logan has made such an insult.\n\n\u2018The people don\u2019t care about you anymore. You\u2019re washed up. A has been,\u2019 KSI tweeted in March. \u2018You\u2019re the suicide forest boy, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be. Step aside.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American vlogger hit back: \u2018Aren\u2019t you on your fifth abortion g? crazy theory but: life is about more than views\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s about\u2026 ya know\u2026 life?\u2019\n\nThe rematch is due to take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday 9 November.\n\nThe first match ended in a majority draw following six rounds of sparring \u2013 in an evening which also saw Logan\u2019s brother Jake Paul go head to head with KSI\u2019s brother Deji.\n\nLogan Paul and KSI have both been approached by metro.co.uk for further comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
