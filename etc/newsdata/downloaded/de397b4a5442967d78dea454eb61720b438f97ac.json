The WDMM will be the first global resource to connect them with mining farms who have the available power resources to host them for a fee.\n\n\u201cThe WDMM will help make cryptocurrency mining more sustainable in the long-run by connecting mining farms and hardware owners in a whole new way. It is part of our commitment to provide miners with on-going support throughout their hardware\u2019s lifetime and to support the sector\u2019s overall growth,\u201d said Matthew Wang, Director of Mining Farm of Bitmain.\n\nMining farm owners can apply to be listed on the WDMM during the WDMS. Applicants will need to provide details on their current mining farm setup and capacity to host other miners. In return, participants will be given personalised services from Bitmain which includes assistance with mining farm design, connections to foreign customers to host, and support with operations, purchasing and construction.\n\n\u201cBeing listed on the WDMM helped me to find miners who want to host their rigs in my facility. Bitmain was able to connect me with the right customers to fill in the extra capacity I had. This is the support I needed to help me expand my facility at a faster pace,\u201d said Gregory Ohanessian, Chief Mining Officer of VC Mining.\n\n\u201cTapping into Bitmain\u2019s assessment and support services via the WDMM helped me to optimise my facility. Their team suggested new ways to further the overall output from my Antminers while reducing downtime. This has made it cheaper to build my mining farm and made operations more cost-effective, driving overall profits,\u201d added Dmitrii Ushakov, Chief Commercial Officer of Bitriver.\n\nDuring the WDMS, Bitmain will also announce the winners of the Top 10 Mining Farms around the world. The summit will provide a workshop focused on mining farm data analysis, as well as discussions on the future of mining facilities. There will be opportunities for miners and mining farm owners to exchange ideas and explore partnership opportunities.\n\nVoting for the Top 10 Mining Farms is still open and individuals can cast a vote here.\n\nAbout Bitmain\n\nFounded in 2013, Bitmain transforms computing by building industry-defining technology in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI).
