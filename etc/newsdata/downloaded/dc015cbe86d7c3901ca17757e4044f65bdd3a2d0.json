Employees at several affected stores confirmed the closings when reached by phone.\n\nWe estimate that fewer than 300 Sears and Kmart stores could remain after the next couple of rounds of closings.\n\nWhen Transform Holdco bought Sears out of bankruptcy in February, the company had roughly 400 Sears and Kmart stores. Transform Holdco stopped reporting its store closure activity in August, except to confirm closing locations to local media outlets.\n\nThe company declined to comment on this story.\n\nThe following stores will close in the next couple of months. We'll update this list if we learn of additional closures.\n\nSears stores\n\n2500 Riverchase Galleria Birmingham, AL* Somersville Road, Antioch, CA* 3300 Broadway St., Eureka, CA 2561 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA 9301 Tampa Ave., Northridge, CA 8501 W.
