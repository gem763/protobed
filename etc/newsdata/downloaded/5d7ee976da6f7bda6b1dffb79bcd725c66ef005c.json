If that\u2019s too heavy a lift, then just being a normal human being will do. His #BeWorst attitude + language is influencing future generations.\n\n\n\nOh, one more thing to tell you: Obama was born in the USA.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 https://t.co/vZhGJsVr0A \u2014 Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas (@ananavarro) October 7, 2019\n\nIf @FLOTUS was sincerely interested in helping future generations she wouldn\u2019t support @realDonaldTrump as he pollutes the planet, adds a trillion dollars a year to the national debt, and cuts funding for programs that feed hungry children so he and his elite pals can do less. https://t.co/NSorgFqwwR \u2014 Col.

Don\u2019t. Care. outfit again. And #bebest has gone from cyber bullying to taking care of kids. You have no self awareness.

Tearing children from their families and caging harms kids now. Have you apologized to the Obamas for birtherism and stealing Michelle's speech? \u2014 Delia Cummings (@firstlastsecond) October 7, 2019\n\nso... stealing children from their parents & locking them in cages with no end in sight for their imprisonment is part of your #BeBest initiative, amirite @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP? https://t.co/Gj91KnUyf8 \u2014 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28 \u201c\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc01\u201d (\u29d6) (@GrrlScientist) October 7, 2019\n\nSo this administration's policy is to separate children from their families and lock them in cages. Great for child development. https://t.co/2wcXksZ1uj \u2014 Sr. Simone Campbell (@sr_simone) October 8, 2019\n\nWhy continue to promote this platform when her literal husband - the President - doesn't adhere to any of her \"policies\"???\n\n\n\nNews outlets need to make a choice: are they putting her words into context or are they just giving her carte blanche to spread a faux message? https://t.co/H4eYxzee5b \u2014 Alex Peterson (@alexpABC27) October 7, 2019\n\nBrought to you by the admin who's stolen children away from parents and kept them in cages, at least 7 of whom are now dead.\n\n\n\nBut yeah, #BeBest and whatnot. https://t.co/e7ZEUAUxZg \u2014 Aymann Ismail (@aymanndotcom) October 7, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s STILL talking about this?
