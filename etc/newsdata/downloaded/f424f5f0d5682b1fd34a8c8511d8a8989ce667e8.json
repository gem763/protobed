(AP) - Oklahoma features the nation\u2019s second-highest scoring offense, another Heisman Trophy contender at quarterback and could break its own record from last year in yards per play.\n\nKansas at least avoided a shutout last week at TCU.\n\nNow, two programs at wildly different levels meet Saturday when the sixth-ranked Sooners roll into Memorial Stadium to take on the slumping Jayhawks. They are five-touchdown favorites to romp in their final tuneup before facing No. 11 Texas in the annual Red River rivalry game.\n\n\u201cLincoln Riley\u2019s done a great job taking the reins from a great coach in Bob Stoops,\u201d said first-year Kansas coach Les Miles, who has plenty of experience with the Sooners from his days at Oklahoma State. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a great run with quarterbacks and receivers that can fly, and have height and ball skills, not to mention the quality rushing attack that really kind of matches their ability to throw.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Sooners (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) have no offensive weaknesses.\n\nThat was certainly on display last week, when Jalen Hurts threw for 415 yards and three scores in a 55-14 victory over Texas Tech. Oklahoma also pumped out more than 200 yards rushing and four TDs and its defense held the Red Raiders to a mere 120 yards passing.\n\nThe scary thing for Kansas? Riley thinks Oklahoma can be even better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not playing nearly as consistent as we need to,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThis last week was probably the highest percentage of a game we\u2019ve been able to do that at a pretty good level, but we\u2019re still making too many mistakes to play as good as we\u2019re capable of.\u201d\n\nMiles would love to have that challenge to overcome.\n\nInstead, the Jayhawks (2-3, 0-2) needed a pair of fourth-quarter scores to avoid a shutout in a 51-14 loss to TCU last week. Carter Stanley threw for 84 yards and the offense managed just 75 on the ground for a whopping total of 159 yards total offense.\n\nMaking matters worse, star running back Khalil Herbert apparently walked away from the team.\n\n\u201cI had the opportunity to visit with him (last) Friday night at length. It\u2019s really his business and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m not going to comment on,\u201d Miles said.\n\nHURTS SO BAD\n\nOklahoma\u2019s quarterback, who is averaging 435 yards total offense per game, sounded a big froggy earlier this week because of an illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing major,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING OF HURTS\n\nIt\u2019s not just Hurts\u2019 ability to throw the ball that has made Oklahoma\u2019s offense so dynamic this season. He also enters the game among the top 25 rushers with 443 yards so far.\n\n\u201cIt is a whole other element of the game,\u201d Jayhawks safety Bryce Tornedon said. \u201cObviously you\u2019ve got to add that to the game plan, which makes things a little bit more difficult. But I think we\u2019re going to be prepared.\u201d\n\nHALL YES\n\nJeremiah Hall has embraced Oklahoma\u2019s unique H-back position as a threat to run, catch and block in its potent offense. The redshirt sophomore, who almost quit football as a youth when he was stuck on the offensive line, even caught a touchdown pass against Texas Tech.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get the ball very often,\u201d he said. \u201cSo every time I get the ball and make a play I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, I want it more.\u2019\u201d\n\nPOOKA PROBLEM\n\nHerbert\u2019s decision to transfer, and some uncertainty surrounding fellow Kansas running back Dom Williams, could mean even more work for Pooka Williams. That could create some scary flashbacks for the Sooners, who watched him run for 252 yards and two touchdowns last season in Norman.\n\nCONSTANT GARDNER\n\nFreshman running back Velton Gardner had 61 yards rushing against the Horned Frogs, making a big statement with Herbert and Williams out. The highlight was a 45-yard touchdown run that broke up what had been a shutout.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big runner, has great change of direction and a big smile on his face after he came off the field,\u201d Miles said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that will have a long and very capable career.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma features the nation\u2019s second-highest scoring offense, another Heisman Trophy contender at quarterback and could break its own record from last year in yards per play.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/texas_tech_oklahoma_football_14759_c0-214-5130-3205_s1770x1032.jpg?c20971fd58961ce253b9f0e815e9cc63ccaf7609", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
