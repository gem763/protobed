She\u2019s not a bad public speaker\n\nShe stuck closely to her text, but read it fluently from the prompter. She comes across better from the platform than in interviews, where she often seems indignant and too eager to contradict her interviewer.\n\nThe speech was well written, with a few jokes and some good lines. She said of Boris Johnson: \u201cHe claims he can negotiate a Brexit deal in a month. I wouldn\u2019t hold out much hope; yesterday he failed to negotiate where to have a press conference.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe speech was too long \u2013 party leaders\u2019 conference speeches usually are \u2013 but she gave audience members the uplift for which they came, bringing them to their feet early on with her declaration: \u201cThere is no limit to my ambition for our party \u2013 and today I am standing here as your candidate for prime minister.\u201d\n\n2. She is equidistant from Johnson and Corbyn\n\nShe attacked Johnson for being sexist: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s insults of choice are rather revealing. Big girl\u2019s blouse, girly swot. But let me tell you, conference, if he thinks being a woman is somehow a weakness, he\u2019s about to find out: it is not.\u201d\n\nBut then she lumped Jeremy Corbyn in \u201cthe collective forces of nationalism and populism\u201d with Johnson and \u200bNigel Farage. She said of Corbyn: \u201cIf he had campaigned to Remain in 2016 with half of the energy he put into the 2017 election, we might have seen a different result. Nigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But she stole Labour\u2019s clothes\n\nShe pledged to \u201cchallenge vested interests and concentrations of power\u201d and nicked the slogan of the Corbyn supporters\u2019 group Momentum: \u201cImagine that a different world is possible.\u201d\n\nAnd she praised Jacinda Ardern, the Labour prime minister of New Zealand: \u201cThanks to her, the New Zealand government set out the world\u2019s first wellbeing budget.\u201d\n\n4. And told Caroline Lucas to back off\n\nAfter the Green MP accused her of imperilling democracy by proposing to cancel Brexit without another referendum, Swinson parked her tanks on Lucas\u2019s green lawn, declaring that \u201cmy Liberal Democrat government will introduce climate risk reporting and create a new Green Investment Bank\u201d.\n\nShe also entered the competitive auction to declare the earliest target date for net-zero carbon emissions. The government has announced 2050; Swinson said \u201c2045 and earlier if possible\u201d \u2013 with \u201ca UK Citizens\u2019 Climate Assembly to drive a national debate about how exactly we will reach net zero\u201d \u2013 while the Green Party and Momentum want 2030.\n\nAnd if it was simple-minded environmental slogans the delegates wanted, they got them: \u201cAs the placards say, there is no Planet B.\u201d\n\n5. She appealed to her party to lay off Phillip Lee\n\nShe had a clever passage in praise of openness and tolerance: \u201cWe cannot be satisfied with a place on the fringes of British politics, narrow and pure, small and irrelevant. Our job is to gather the forces of liberalism, and be the rallying point for change.\u201d\n\nFor those in the party who are unhappy about admitting Phillip Lee, the Conservative defector who abstained on the same-sex marriage vote, she spelt it out: \u201cWe must be welcoming and inclusive, recognising the journey fellow travellers are on.\u201d\n\n6. She won\u2019t apologise for trying to stop Brexit\n\nShe repeated the signature policy of the conference \u2013 revoking Article 50 without a further referendum \u2013 which has attracted a vast amount of free publicity. (At last, some Remainers are learning from the Leaver tactic in the 2016 referendum campaign of generating controversy that draws attention to their core argument.)\n\nGiven that there are some rough corners in a campaign to overturn the decision of the British people, she did well in presenting her party\u2019s stand against \u201cnationalism and populism\u201d \u2013 \u201cpopulism\u201d of course being code for \u201copinions which are popular but with which the right-thinking sort of people disagree\u201d \u2013 without going into any detail about how she might negotiate in a hung parliament, which is the most likely way in which the Lib Dems might shape the future.\n\nSo the conference rose to its feet happily to applaud her closing words: \u201cWe can change our politics, stop Brexit and win a brighter future.\u201d", "description": "1.
