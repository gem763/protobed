Their posts targeted people in North Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nAt the same time, the social network unveiled several new initiatives to reduce the spread of false information across its services, including an effort to clearly label some inaccurate posts that appear on the site.\n\nThe moves suggest that while Facebook is amping up its protections ahead of the 2020 United States presidential election, malicious actors wanting to shape public discourse show no signs of going away.\n\n\u201cElections have changed significantly since 2016, but Facebook has changed too,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call. \u201cWe face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation-states like Russia, Iran and China, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re more prepared.\u201d\n\nFacebook, by far the world\u2019s largest social network, faces a near-daily torrent of criticism from American presidential candidates, the public, the press and regulators around the world, many of whom argue that the company is unable to properly corral its outsize power.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, recently accused Facebook of being a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine.\u201d The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are conducting investigations into Facebook\u2019s market power and history of technology acquisitions.\n\nFacebook generally takes a hands-off approach toward users sharing false or inaccurate information on the site. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg delivered a robust defense of the company\u2019s policies, including users and politicians\u2019 ability to publish inaccurate posts. He said that Facebook had been founded to give people a voice.\n\nYet even as Facebook has advocated free speech, it has been unable to stem the disinformation that people post on its site. On Monday, the company said the disinformation campaigns it removed included content that touched on conflict in the Middle East, racial strife and posts involving Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York. The posts crossed categories and ideological lines, seemingly with no specific intent other than to foment discord among citizens in multiple countries.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said that over the past three years, Facebook has become better able to seek out and remove foreign influence networks, relying on a team of former intelligence officials, digital forensics experts and investigative journalists. Facebook has more than 35,000 people working on its security initiatives, with an annual budget well into the billions of dollars.\n\nBut as Facebook has honed its skills, so have its adversaries, he said. He added that there has been an escalation of sophisticated attacks coming from Iran and China \u2014 beyond the initial disinformation campaigns from Russia in 2016 \u2014 suggesting that the practice has only grown more popular over the past few years. A cottage industry of companies has also sprung up, he said, selling disinformation services targeted to Facebook to governments and other bad actors.\n\nWhile the company does not want to be an arbiter of what speech is allowed on its site, Facebook said it wanted to be more transparent about where the speech is coming from. To that end, it will now apply labels to pages considered state-sponsored media \u2014 including outlets like Russia Today \u2014 to inform people whether the outlets are wholly or partially under the editorial control of their country\u2019s government. The company will also apply the labels to the outlet\u2019s Facebook Page, as well as make the label visible inside of the social network\u2019s advertising library.\n\n\u00a9 Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, defended his company\u2019s stance on free expression.\n\n\u201cWe will hold these Pages to a higher standard of transparency because they combine the opinion-making influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state,\u201d Facebook said in a blog post.\n\nThe company said it developed its definition of state-sponsored media with input from more than 40 outside global organizations, including Reporters Without Borders, the European Journalism Center, Unesco and the Center for Media, Data and Society.\n\nThe company will also more prominently label posts on Facebook and on its Instagram app that have been deemed partly or wholly false by outside fact-checking organizations. Facebook said the change was meant to help people better determine what they should read, trust and share. The label will be displayed prominently on top of photos and videos that appear in the news feed, as well as across Instagram stories.\n\nIt may be difficult to determine how much of a difference the new, more aggressive labels will make. Home to more than 2.7 billion regular users, Facebook and Instagram see billions of pieces of content shared to their respective networks daily. Fact-checked news and posts represent a fraction of that content. A wealth of information is also spread privately across Facebook\u2019s messaging services like WhatsApp and Messenger, two conduits that have been identified as prime channels for spreading misinformation.\n\nFollow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac.", "description": "Facebook on Monday said it had found and taken down four state-backed disinformation campaigns, the latest of dozens the company has identified and removed this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJ7xrb.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=769&y=374", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
