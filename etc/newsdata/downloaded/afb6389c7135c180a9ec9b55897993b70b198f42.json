Mr Anane said across the $5 billion vitamin market, about 75 per cent of consumers bought their products ''off the shelf'' from retailers like Chemist Warehouse without having tailored advice for their own particular needs.\n\nRocket Internet provided some seed funding originally, and then injected further funds into the business as it gained momentum. Sales had been tripling each month, albeit off a low base.\n\nRocket moves fast\n\nMs Loutati declined to specify the size of the stake which Rocket Internet had obtained.\n\nBut having Rocket Internet's funds and expertise was invaluable because they weren't afraid of expanding businesses quickly.\n\n\"It's definitely the speed at which they operate. We really like the way they move fast,'' she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRocket Internet was a strong backer of The Iconic, which has grown to become one of the best known online fashion retailers in Australia. The Iconic is now part of the Global Fashion Group, which listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in June in a $1.8 billion float.\n\nGlobal Fashion Group also owns online retailers Zalora, Dafiti and Lamoda.\n\nThe Iconic\u2019s revenues climbed by 38 per cent to $371 million in the year ended December, and revenues have risen fivefold since 2014.\n\nRocket earlier this year sold out of global home meal kits group HelloFresh, which in Australia is in a fierce battle with rival Marley Spoon. Supermarket giant Woolworths in June took a stake in Marley Spoon.\n\nHelloFresh stint\n\nMs Loutati worked at HelloFresh in Australia, and for three years from the end of 2015 was the Head of Product Development and Consumer Experience for that firm.\n\nShe said the main customer base for Vitable was largely between the 25 to 45 age group. When the business was in the planning phase, the co-founders thought it would be the tech-savvy Millennials who might form the core customer base.\n\n\"Actually the customer segment is a little older than we thought,'' she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vitable expansion comes as big global players increasingly look to personalised nutrition as a growth industry. The health science arm of global food giant Nestle in late August acquired vitamin subscription service Persona in the United States.\n\nVitable wants to build its brand locally to give it extra clout in the eyes of Asian consumers before expanding into Asia.\n\n\"Expanding to Asia Pacific is definitely in our planning,'' she said.", "description": "The European investor, which backed The Iconic and HelloFresh, is now targeting Australia's $5 billion vitamin sector with Vitable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2758%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0b075e51743a74cba86d490512984a0abdcd65c3", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
