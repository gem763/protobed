While other parts of the economy that depend on export growth may show some weakening, consumers have remained confident and willing to spend.\u201d\n\nWhy? Consumers\u2019 appraisal of the job market is more favorable. According to the Conference Board, \u201cThose saying jobs are \u2018plentiful\u2019 increased from 45.6 percent to 51.2 percent, while those claiming jobs are \u2018hard to get\u2019 declined from 12.5 percent to 11.8 percent.\u201d\n\nThe United States is a consumer-driven economy that accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The second estimate for second-quarter 2019 GDP showed a downward revision to 2.0 percent annualized growth from 2.1 percent annualized growth reported in the advance estimate, according to Briefing.com. Despite the adjustment, the numbers show that the trade war hasn\u2019t materially impacted spending trends.\n\n\u201cThe key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending growth was revised up to 4.7% from 4.3%, which was the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2014,\u201d according to Briefing.com. \u201cGranted it\u2019s a backward-looking data point, yet it offers a nice reminder that the U.S. consumer, supported by a tight labor market, has remained in good shape.\u201d\n\nReduced borrowing costs within a $21+ trillion economy is acting as a huge lever and I expect the Fed to keep the consumer jazzed with rate cut on Sept. 18.\n\nWho would have wagered a lunch at a Wall Street food truck that the big-box retailers would be the hottest sector during August with trade tensions boiling over? Shares of Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) soared this past month. As a side note, Costco opened its first store in Shanghai and had the local police limit the number of customers occupying the store at any given time to 2,000! I guess Costco consumers in Shanghai didn\u2019t get the memo that there\u2019s a trade war breaking the Chinese economy.\n\nThe trade war with China reached a fever pitch on Friday, Aug. 13, after President Trump tweeted that he would retaliate against China\u2019s new tariffs on U.S. imports by raising tariffs on Chinese imports. The talk sent the Dow plunging by over 700 points.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the robust U.S. consumer that alters the negative investor sentiment, it\u2019s the simple fact that money goes where it is best served. Hedge fund Hayman Capital\u2019s manager Kyle Bass, whom I view as sharp and transparent, stated in a CNBC interview on Aug. 20, \u201cWe\u2019re the only country that has an integer in front of our bond yields. We have 90% of the world\u2019s investment-grade debt. We actually have rule of law and we have a decent economy. All the money is going to come here.\u201d\n\nAll this good news regarding an upbeat consumer comes at a time when investor sentiment is in the tank. The latest American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey has bullish sentiment down at 26.1% and well off its mid-30% historical level that is considered neutral. The good news about this survey is that it happens to be one of the most accurate contra-indicators that signal market tops and bottoms. If past is prologue, a low bullish reading of 26.1% is a green light to add equity risk to portfolios.\n\nIs the Baltic Dry Index Signaling a Global Economic Recovery?\n\nThe Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials, such as coal, copper, cement and iron ore. The Baltic Exchange calculates the index by assessing multiple shipping rates across more than 20 routes for each of the BDI component vessels. Analyzing multiple geographic shipping paths for each index gives depth to the index\u2019s composite measurement. Members contact dry bulk shippers worldwide to gather their prices and they then calculate an average. The Baltic Exchange issues the BDI daily.\n\nBecause dry bulk primarily consists of materials that function as raw material inputs to the production of intermediate or finished goods, such as concrete, electricity, steel and food, the index is also seen as an efficient economic indicator of future economic growth and production. The BDI is considered by some people as a leading economic indicator because it predicts future economic activity.\n\nUnlike stock and bond markets, the BDI \u201cis totally devoid of speculative content,\u201d said Howard Simons, an economist and columnist at TheStreet.com. \u201cPeople don\u2019t book freighters unless they have cargo to move. News flash: this past week the Baltic Dry Index traded to a fresh nine-year high capped by a torrid seven-day straight up rally.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not making a call on a global economic rebound, but am simply bringing to light an identifier that got my attention this past week. Since the great majority of economic data are looking backward, it just makes sense to pay attention to the BDI Index for clues that fully defy the current and widely-held bearish narrative regarding global growth. It is food for thought, but also quite possibly a healthy tea leaf amid a very crowded field of thorny prognostications.\n\nJoin me at The MoneyShow Philadelphia!\n\nThe MoneyShow is heading to Philadelphia for the first time ever and I\u2019m excited to join some of the country\u2019s smartest professional investors and traders at this complimentary, three-day event, Sept. 26-28.\n\nI will be analyzing sectors and trends, as well as sharing with you time-tested strategies for profiting in the markets.\n\nI also will be joined by investing experts such as Hilary Kramer, Bob Carlson and Dr. Mark Skousen in discussing stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), income investing, real estate investment trusts (REITs), commodities, trading strategies and much more!\n\nTo register, click here or call 1-800-226-0323 and be sure to mention my priority code of 048301 to receive complimentary admission.\n\nThe post Consumer Spending and High Seas Indicators Turn Sharply Bullish appeared first on Stock Investor.", "description": "The month of August closed out on a three-day uptick .09/09/2019 19:16:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Bryan Perry", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
