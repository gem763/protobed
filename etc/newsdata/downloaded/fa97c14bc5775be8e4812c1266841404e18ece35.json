A New York court earlier this month blocked that state's ban from taking effect.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Juul was sued in federal court in San Francisco by a Florida woman who said her son, Daniel Wakefield, died in his sleep at age 18 as a result of Juul use. The mother, Lisa Vail, is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nVail's lawsuit is the first wrongful death case to be brought against Juul, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company already faces a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against Juul and, in some cases, its parent company, Marlboro maker Altria Group (N: ).\n\nMost of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.", "description": "Michigan judge blocks flavored vape ban as Juul faces wrongful death lawsuit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E1TY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
