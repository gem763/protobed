A tailor, school meals supervisor, bus driver and sexual health nurse tell all\n\nIn the future, the people who spend their careers doing the same job will be historical curios, the workplace equivalent of a narwhal\u2019s tusk. We\u2019ll look at them, and marvel at how much careers have changed.\n\nTechnology has profoundly transformed the nature of the work we do. The Office for National Statistics predicts that 1.5 million British workers risk losing their jobs as a result of automation, with farm workers, waiting staff and shelf fillers notably at risk. At the same time, globalisation has decimated UK manufacturing, with jobs outsourced to developing nations with cheaper workforces and fewer labour protections. The rise of the gig economy has also seen a growing number of people in precarious, low-paid temporary work, without the perks of permanent employees: maternity leave, sick pay or a pension. What this means is that the halcyon days of a job for life are slipping away. The future is coming for us, whether we want it or not.\n\nBut it is not here just yet. There are still people who have proudly spent their entire lives with one company. What can we learn about the world of work from the most loyal employees?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Still cutting it \u2026 Andrew Gomez in his Savile Row workshop. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nThe tailor\n\nAndrew Gomez, 80, Gieves & Hawkes, Savile Row\n\nAndrew Gomez is pinning a summer jacket in navy-blue Italian wool, a silver thimble on his right forefinger, when I arrive. He has worked here, in the basement workshop underneath the luxuriously appointed showroom of Gieves & Hawkes, for 45 years.\n\nAfter training as a tailor in his native Spain, Gomez came to Gieves & Hawkes in September 1974 looking for a job. They asked him to tailor a \u201cfull baste\u201d \u2013 which means he had to half make a bespoke suit \u2013 as a test. After inspecting it, the manager asked him to come in the next Monday. \u201cThey fell in love with my work,\u201d Gomez laughs.\n\nHe didn\u2019t plan to spend his career at Gieves & Hawkes. But every time Gomez muttered about leaving, his bosses would give him a pay rise. \u201cThey said: \u2018We\u2019ll give you the money you want! No one else will pay you more than us. You\u2019ll have a job for life.\u2019\u201d So he stayed.\n\nTime passed. He was a speedy \u2013 and hard \u2013 worker. \u201cNo one ever complained about my work, or gave me anything back to redo,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cI always did my best.\u201d He believes this is why he has lasted so long in the organisation. \u201cYou cannot just work for money,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cYou have a responsibility to do a proper job. You have to make the effort every single day, otherwise the job will go wrong.\u201d\n\nNearly half a century on, Gomez has made, by his own estimation, 15,000 jackets. But he isn\u2019t ready to retire yet. \u201cMy wife and daughter tell me off all the time. They say: \u2018Why do you work? Why don\u2019t you retire?\u2019 But I wouldn\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t want to stay home and be bored.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest June Hallworth \u2026 serving pints since 1957. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nThe bar worker\n\nJune Hallworth, 81, the Davenport Arms, Stockport, Greater Manchester\n\nThe Davenport Arms \u2013 known locally as the Thief\u2019s Neck \u2013 has been in Hallworth\u2019s family for 87 years. She started behind the bar in 1957, when she began going out with John, who would become her husband. His father, Eric, managed the pub. \u201cIt was the first pub I had ever been in,\u201d Hallworth remembers. \u201cI\u2019d come and stand at the bar when John was working. And then my father-in-law said: \u2018It\u2019s no use you standing there! Get behind the bar and get something done.\u2019\u201d\n\nBar work didn\u2019t come easily to her at first. \u201cI was a nervous wreck. People would be asking for drinks, and I didn\u2019t understand what they meant.\u201d With time came confidence. \u201cI could stand up for myself and answer people back, rather than being meek and mild.\u201d\n\nJohn died 18 years ago. Hallworth\u2019s daughter Yvonne runs the pub now. It\u2019s an increasingly difficult trade to be in \u2013 more than 25% of British pubs have closed since 2001 \u2013 and Hallworth worries about Yvonne\u2019s future. \u201cJohn and I had the best years of it. Yvonne has struggled at times. She has gone through two recessions. Pub life isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard work. You put in so many hours \u2013 it\u2019s not an eight-hour day. You\u2019ve got to be dedicated.\u201d\n\nDespite a life spent around alcohol, Hallworth doesn\u2019t actually drink. \u201cMy husband used to ask: \u2018Is there nothing you like the look of?\u2019\u201d Yet she has witnessed changing drinking habits: before, you\u2019d struggle to get people out of the pub after last orders. \u201cYou\u2019d have to shout at them to drink up. Now, people drink earlier. You can lock up more easily.\u201d\n\nHallworth still does five two-hour shifts a week. She\u2019ll carry food from the kitchen and pull pints, although she has stopped changing barrels. \u201cI like the social side of it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBeing able to talk to people. Since my husband died, it has been a blessing for me to keep coming in here and meeting people, rather than being on my own.\u201d\n\nThe pub still has customers whom Hallworth served in the 80s and 90s. \u201cThey say: \u2018You don\u2019t look any different, June.\u2019 I say: \u2018I must have looked like an old-so-and-so 20 years ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Hallworth never thought she would work in a pub her whole life, she is at peace with how things turned out. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other life. I\u2019ve been quite happy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Neil Talbot, master bus driver at his depot in Birmingham. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nThe bus driver\n\nNeil Talbot, 56, National Express, Birmingham.\n\nThe first time Talbot saw a doubledecker bus, he remembers thinking: \u201c\u2018Yes!\u2019 It had always been a dream to drive a doubledecker bus,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to get into that chair.\u201d He applied to National Express in 1990 and never looked back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I clipped a few car mirrors when I started,\u201d Talbot admits. And passengers can be tricky. \u201cYou can get some very aggressive passengers,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when they\u2019re shouting at you, you have to stay cool and calm.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Talbot took leave from National Express to do a six-month tour of Afghanistan as an army reserve sergeant. \u201cI just loved that green uniform,\u201d Talbot says of his parallel career. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in weapons. I thought: the only way to fire a gun is to be in the army.\u201d\n\nHe loves his driving job because he\u2019s a sociable person. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to have a good talk with the passengers \u2026 a bit of banter. You can\u2019t just drive like a robot and not say anything.\u201d Almost everyone on Talbot\u2019s route, the 94 from Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood, knows him. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019re my favourite driver \u2026 what\u2019s up?\u2019 Everyone says hello to me.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Talbot qualified as a master bus driver, a title conferred by National Express on drivers with \u201can impeccable safety record and driving skills\u201d. It was a proud achievement. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a master driver, you have to wear a white shirt and blue tie. People asked me about it, and I said: \u2018As it says on the tin \u2013 master driver! I\u2019m one of the best in the pack.\u2019\u201d\n\nI ask him why he has stayed in the same job for nearly three decades. \u201cYou have to be passionate about what you\u2019re doing. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. If I weren\u2019t, I\u2019d have gone ages ago. This is the job for me. I just love talking to the passengers. I\u2019m a people person.\u201d\n\nAnd the best seat on the bus? \u201cThe driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Talbot laughs.\n\nOf course.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eileen Barrett at work in the school kitchen. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Guardian\n\nThe school meals supervisor\n\nEileen Barrett, 69, St Ursula\u2019s school, Havering, east London\n\nAfter 43 years as a school meals supervisor, Barrett still turns up for work half an hour early every day to start making cakes by hand. Her favourite part of the day? Serving the children. \u201cEspecially when they come back and say: \u2018Miss, can we have seconds?\u2019 Your job feels worthwhile.\u201d\n\nWhy does Barrett love her job so much? \u201cIt\u2019s the babies! They\u2019re lovely,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like cooking for your family.\u201d Barrett\u2019s grandchildren, Charlie and Chanel, went to St Ursula\u2019s \u2013 but she is adamant that she didn\u2019t slip them any extra treats. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get any special treatment.\u201d\n\nWhen Barrett started, everything was prepared from scratch. They made meat puddings, mince-and-onion pie and toad-in-the-hole. The 90s marked the advent of processed food. But with Jamie Oliver\u2019s healthy school dinners campaign in the 00s, the pendulum swung back. \u201cWe have gone back to how things were before,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cFresh meat and fresh veg.\u201d She welcomes it. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better for the children. Now, we hardly fry at all. Everything goes in the oven.\u201d The one constant? Fish and chips on a Friday.\n\nTechnology, however, has transformed the job. Once, Barrett was one of a team of 11 school meals supervisors. Now, she leads a team of four, who make 290 meals daily. Every morning, the children will choose from three meal options on an iPad in their classrooms and the orders will then come through to Barrett. \u201cI like the technology,\u201d she says. \u201cI found it quite easy to adopt.\u201d\n\nBarrett thinks she is a good employee because she never gave her bosses any trouble. \u201cI go into work, do my job properly and help out where I can. If they needed me to cater functions now and again for visitors, I\u2019d always say yes.\u201d\n\nBeing around children keeps her young, she thinks. \u201cI should have retired, but I don\u2019t want to. Please, God, I want to go on as long as I can. That\u2019s how much I love it. I don\u2019t get bored of it.\u201d\n\nBarrett didn\u2019t plan to spend her working life at the same school \u2013 things just turned out that way. \u201cI never thought I would be here as long as this. I never gave it much of a thought. But since I loved working here, I never noticed being here for so long.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cecilia Anim outside the Margaret Pyke centre in London. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nThe nurse\n\nCecilia Anim, 71, sexual and reproductive health specialist at the Margaret Pyke centre, London\n\nAnim moved to the UK from Ghana in 1973. It wasn\u2019t always easy. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many black people then,\u201d Anim says. \u201cThere was a little bit of racism.\u201d She trained as a nurse at Hull Royal Infirmary, where a patient once told Anim to \u201ctake my filthy black hands off her\u201d. When she moved to the Margaret Pyke in 1979, patients would sometimes assume that Anim \u2013 the only black nurse \u2013 was a cleaner.\n\nWhy is Anim still working full-time at the age of 71? \u201cI love my job,\u201d she says. \u201cI came to women\u2019s health with this vision of wanting to make things better for my patients.\u201d She is also loyal to her employers because they supported her when her daughter Ruth, who has learning difficulties, was born in 1985. \u201cAfter I had Ruth, and went back to work, my manager said: \u2018Whatever you need to make this work, we will support you.\u2019\u201d She pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favourite memories from my career.\u201d\n\nBeing in an organisation for all these years allows you to change things from within. \u201cYou learn about attitudes to employees, about workplace practices and how you can influence them.\u201d\n\nAnim rose within the ranks of the Royal College of Nursing, becoming its first black president in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m still walking on air from that!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement, not only for me but for the other BAME people behind me.\u201d She was given a CBE in 2017, in recognition of her contribution to nursing.\n\nAnim is dismayed by the anti-immigration sentiment in the UK since the Brexit vote. \u201cIt\u2019s created division and resentment \u2026 the rhetoric saddens me. If it was like that in the 70s, maybe I\u2019d have upped sticks and gone back home. And that would have been a great loss.\u201d\n\nDoes she have any plans to retire? \u201cI will go when I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve got the skills and, by the grace of God, I\u2019ve got the strength and the energy. I still think there\u2019s something I can contribute to healthcare.\u201d", "description": "What is it like to have the same job in the same company for as long as 40 years?
