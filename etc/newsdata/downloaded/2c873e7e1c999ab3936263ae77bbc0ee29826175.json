But the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator for the PC, recently released an update that allows games like Super Mario Odyssey to run at a full 60 frames per second, which is the same performance as you\u2019ll get on the actual Switch hardware.\n\nGetting classic games from older consoles like the Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo to run perfectly through a software emulator actually requires a significant amount of processing power as the CPU has to emulate the behaviour of the processors and other chips those consoles relied on.\n\nAs a result the emulated experience is never a perfect recreation. Often times there are frame rate issues or weird sound artifacts that pop up, which is why companies like Analogue build physical hardware that behaves exactly like those old processors did to flawlessly emulate games.\n\nBut since throwback consoles like the Mega Sg cost $280, and most software emulators are free to download, gamers are usually happy to live with a few compromises.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a different story with modern consoles, however. They often use custom chips based on the same CPU and graphics card architecture as PCs do, so there\u2019s the potential for emulated games to perform much better. Software emulators still don\u2019t offer a gaming experience that 100 per cent matches what consoles like the Switch can do, but as a recent update to Yuzu proves, they\u2019re getting real close.\n\nYouTuber BSoD Gaming tried out the latest Yuzu release and was impressed to find that through most of Super Mario Odyssey, the emulator was able to spit out frames at 60 frames per second, with the frame rate only slightly dropping in some of the game\u2019s more complex levels. But its worst performance is now actually better than the emulator\u2019s previous best, and the same performance boost was seen with the Switch game Pok\u00e9mon Let\u2019s Go.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive accomplishment given Yuzu was only first able to play Super Mario Odyssey last July, and a year later it\u2019s boasting performance stats that rival the actual Switch. But at the same time, the emulator has to be optimised and tweaked for every Switch game it wants to support, and that can be a long and time-consuming process.\n\nIf you\u2019re really chomping at the bit to play the latest and greatest from Nintendo, you\u2019re better off dropping $300 on the Switch Lite and just get on with it, instead of hoping your gaming PC has the necessary horsepower to fake it.", "description": "For whatever reason you turn to them, emulators have always offered a gaming experience that was almost as good as the real thing, although not quite perfect.
