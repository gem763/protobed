It was a tepid event, punctuated by the occasional polite golf clap.\n\nExpect more excitement in the crowd at Sunday\u2019s Redskins home opener. After all, the Dallas Cowboys are in town, and their noisy fans will likely swarm into Ghost Town Field \u2014 the stadium formerly known as FedEx Field \u2014 to take over some of the huge swaths of empty seats.\n\nIn its heyday, FedEx Field never provided much of a home-field advantage for the Redskins. But Ghost Town Field? Even worse. And Sunday could mark a new low.\n\nA year ago, the Redskins were returning home after an impressive 24-6 road win over the Arizona Cardinals. Behind new quarterback Alex Smith and a rejuvenated Adrian Peterson, there was every reason for Washington fans to welcome their team home in style and numbers.\n\nRemember, these were the Redskins of Brian Lafemina, the chief operating officer brought in from the NFL to breathe life into a dying brand. He recognized the landscape had changed in the NFL, and that in today\u2019s spectator sports world, you have sell, sell and sell.\n\nHe was appearing on every sports talk radio show on the dial, telling everyone that plenty of seats were available \u2014 very un-Redskins like. He had already acknowledged the waiting list for season ticket holders was a myth.\n\nThere were former Redskins players around the area giving away tickets to strangers on the street, like they were giving out handbills in Times Square. Despite pulling out all the stops, Ghost Town Field was \u2026 well, a ghost town. An announced crowd of 57,013 showed up, most of them to welcome home their Redskins, but also a surprisingly visible and vocal group of supporters for the opposing team, the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIt was by far the lowest attendance for a home opener in the stadium since it opened in 1997.\n\nSunday won\u2019t likely be a repeat of last year\u2019s home opener \u2014 but not for any reasons that would encourage Redskins officials. This time the opponent isn\u2019t the Colts.\n\nLook for a large and vocal crowd of Cowboys fans on Sunday. I guess we\u2019ll find out which is worse \u2014 empty seats or a stadium full of people rooting for the Redskins\u2018 biggest rival.\n\nUnlike last year, the Redskins this year return home off a demoralizing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nRedskins fans no longer have any interest in fighting the good fight, which is ostensibly what Washington did against the Eagles \u2013 at least, for the first half, putting on an impressive offensive display led by new quarterback Case Keenum.\n\nNo, Redskins fans are already angry before even seeing their team take the home field. The debate this week on sports talk radio wasn\u2019t getting fired up about Dallas week. It was about how coach Jay Gruden foolishly benched future Hall of Famer Adrian Peterson for that game in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Cowboys, who have significantly better offensive skill position players than the Redskins, are coming off a 35-17 win over the New York Giants. The Cowboys will be coming to Ghost Town Field expecting to celebrate a victory.\n\nThat\u2019s not a lock, though. The Redskins\u2018 defense handled Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott in their first meeting last year, as he managed just 33 yards on 18 carries in a 20-17 Washington win.\n\nThey had 66,301 there at Ghost Town Field that day \u2014 many of them Cowboys fans, with another 15,000 empty seats.\n\nIn fact, at one point last season when the Redskins returned home with a 5-2 record to face the Atlanta Falcons, they drew just 62,386, leaving 20,000 empty seats.\n\nThose numbers came out during a fleeting moment during the brief age of transparency, when team president Bruce Allen, the Prince of Darkness, was a spectator.\n\nHe eventually sent Lafemina \u2014 and his age of transparency \u2014 packing.\n\nAt the Welcome Home Luncheon, Dan Snyder never spoke to the roomful of so-called boosters. Neither did the Prince of Darkness. But when their names were mentioned at the start of the program, without incident, there seemed a sense of relief in the room there wasn\u2019t a round of boos.\n\nAs Ghost Town Field opens its 23rd season Sunday, the bar isn\u2019t set much higher.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
