The price of beverages, from a pint of beer to a large coffee, can add up over the week without offering much bang for your buck in terms of satiation \u2014 at $8 a pop, they fall distinctly into 'splurge' territory. For the same price, you can make an entire stellar homemade meal, often with leftovers to spare.\n\nWe have three such recipes right here. The results are delicious, filling, and will keep your food budget on track this school year. And, there are options noted with each recipe to revise them to your dietary preferences.\n\nSo make your drinks at home or reach for one from your own fridge, and cook up something that tastes like a million bucks, all for less than $8 per serving.\n\nSaucy Baked Pizza Chicken\n\nWho needs pricey takeout chicken pizza when you can have homemade pizza chicken?! All of the flavours you love in a slice can be found in this budget-friendly meal, made for two, for the price of a pint of beer or large whipped cream-and-caramel-topped coffee. Ask a friend to bring over a salad and call it dinner.\n\nPreheat your oven to 400F degrees. Rub 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts with 2 tablespoons olive oil, \u00bd teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning and \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt, and then place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the chicken for 15 minutes, remove from the oven and then top each chicken breast with 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce (per breast) and \u00bc cup shredded mozzarella (per breast) and a few slices of cured pepperoni or salami. Transfer the chicken back to the oven and bake for a further 10 minutes. The internal temperature of the chicken should read 165F degrees on a digital thermometer or release no pink with the clear juices when you slice into the thickest part; keep baking for another 5 minutes or so if the chicken is not up to temperature. Serves 2.\n\nMake it vegan: Replace the chicken with extra-firm tofu, the pepperoni with sliced vegan sausage or crumbled smoky tempeh, and mozzarella with a dairy-free version.\n\nMake it gluten-free: The recipe can be made as is but note: some pre-shredded cheeses use gluten-containing starches and flours to keep the shreds distinct (grate your own cheese to avoid the problem); look for a certified gluten-free label on your pepperoni or salami as these can often contain wheat flours or starches.\n\nAnother chicken recipe to try that comes in under budget: Harissa-Marinated Chicken\n\nCurried Lentils with Spinach, Rice and Naan\n\nThis vegan, Indian-inspired dinner is a complete meal-in-a-bowl, filled with nourishing and affordable lentils and rice. This dinner for four can be made for the price of a pint, so you can feed your housemates or have a handful of packed lunches waiting for you for the week.\n\nCook 1\u00bd cups basmati rice according to package directions. For the lentils, in a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil or neutral oil over medium heat and then add 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of minced ginger and 1 tablespoon of curry powder, and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add 2 cups of water, 1 cup of dried brown lentils, 1 (14 oz) can of coconut milk, 1 vegan bouillon cube and \u00bc tsp salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the lentils are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. At the last minute, stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and a couple of handfuls of baby spinach to wilt. Serve the lentils over the cooked rice and/or with prepared naan. Serves 4.\n\nPump up the protein: For a budget-friendly protein option, top your lentil bowl with a poached or fried egg.\n\nMake it gluten-free: Skip the naan and serve with gluten-free brown rice tortillas in its place.\n\nAnother lentil recipe to try that comes in under budget: Mexican Lentil Soup\n\nLoaded Roasted Sweet Potato Nachos\n\nHealthy baked sweet potato rounds are covered in your favourite nacho toppings for a dinner-meets-bar snack that's better tasting \u2014 and better for you \u2014 than anything you'll find outside of the house.\n\nPreheat your oven to 375F degrees. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Scrub and dry 4 small or 2 very large sweet potatoes and then peel and slice each potato into rounds about \u00bd-inch in thickness. Add potatoes to the prepared baking sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, \u00bd teaspoon of ground cumin, \u00bd teaspoon of ground chili powder and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Spread them out in a single layer and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and beginning to caramelize on the bottom. Flip the potatoes to show the caramelized side up for serving; add them to a large platter or build them up right on the baking sheet: top them evenly with 1 cup of canned black beans (drained and rinsed), 2 cups of shredded iceberg lettuce, \u00bd cup of salsa or diced tomatoes, 1 diced ripe avocado, 2 sliced green onions, \u00bd cup Greek yogurt and the juice of \u00bd lime. Serve with hot sauce, if desired. Serves 4.\n\nPump up the protein: Leftover cooked, shredded chicken or cooked ground beef are game-changing nacho protein toppers. Vegetarians may want to add a sprinkle of cheddar cheese or crumbled tempeh instead.\n\nMake it vegan: Replace the Greek yogurt with non-dairy sour cream or yogurt.\n\nAnother sweet potato recipe to try that comes in under budget: Sweet Potato, Coconut and Ginger Soup\n\nAllison Day is the cookbook author of Modern Lunch.
