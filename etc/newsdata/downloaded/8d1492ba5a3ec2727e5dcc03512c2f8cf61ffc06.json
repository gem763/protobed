Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive. The Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone. Plus...he\u2019s always got Dr. Banner with science and reason. pic.twitter.com/jN8BDzgpWl \u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole,\u201d the actor tweeted. \u201cMad and strong can also be dense and destructive.\n\n\u201cThe Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone.\n\n\u201cPlus\u2026 he\u2019s always got Dr Banner with science and reason.\u201d\n\nThe actor, who has played the Hulk since 2012, joined a number who suggested the prime minister lacked understanding of the comic book character when he made the comparison, the Press Association reports.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing my kids would say aside from they would never make such glaring errors about The Hulk, I\u2019ve raised them properly,\u201d Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted.\n\nCall The Midwife actor Stephen McGann added: \u201cI also note, with reference to the Hulk, that Theresa May\u2019s \u2018red, white and blue Brexit\u2019 has morphed effortlessly into a \u2018green, violent and emotionally unstable\u2019 Brexit. Righto.\u201d\n\nThe only similarity between Boris Johnson and the Incredible Hulk is that they both often wake up wondering where their trousers are. \u2014 Mr Roger Quimbly (@RogerQuimbly) September 15, 2019\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay praised Johnson\u2019s novel metaphor and even revived another recent favourite of the Conservative Party \u2013 an assertion that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a \u201cchicken\u201d for not voting for an early general election.\n\n\u201cThe Hulk was a winner and was extremely popular and I\u2019d rather be backing a character and a leader who is The Hulk, rather than one who is on the \u2018chicken run\u2019, as Jeremy Corbyn is,\u201d Barclay told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday.\n\nBut the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the Prime Minister\u2019s Incredible Hulk comparison as \u201cinfantile\u201d even when compared with the rhetoric of US President Donald Trump.\n\nEven to Trumpian standards the Hulk comparison is infantile. Is the EU supposed to be scared by this? The British public impressed?
