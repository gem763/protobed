The illnesses include 33 hospitalizations and 26 cases of children under five, federal health officials said on Thursday.\n\nDog owners should not buy or feed any pig ears to their pets, including treats already in homes, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reiterated in an update.\n\nThe warning comes two days after the latest in a string of recalls involving the dog snacks. Dog Goods USA expanded a previous recall to include all 30-packs of Berkley & Jensen brand pig ears sold at BJ's Wholesale Club stores. The company purchased the pig ears from a single supplier in Brazil from September 2018 through August 2019.\n\nRecalled product U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania-based company last month recalled Chef Toby Pig Ears Treats sold nationwide after being contacted by the FDA, which tested pig ears from the company's Brazilian supplier and found that one sample tested positive for salmonella, the company said in a recall notice posted by the FDA. (see list of lot codes below.)\n\nSeparately, Clearwater, Florida-based Brutus & Barnaby last Tuesday recalled all size variations of its Pig Ears 100% Natural Treats for Dogs because of possible salmonella contamination.\n\nBags of 8-count, 12-count, 25-count and 100-count pig ears were distributed across the country through Amazon.com, Chewy.com, Brutusandbarnaby.com and a physical store, Natures Food Patch, in Clearwater, the company said.\n\nConsumers who purchased Brutus & Barnaby pig ears were urged to destroy any remaining product and to contact the place of purchase for a refund. Those with questions can call the company at 1-800-489-0970 Monday-Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern.\n\nRecalled product U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe recalls come amid an investigation by the FDA and the CDC that has now prompted five separate recalls and a general warning from the agencies against all pig-ear treats for now.\n\nThe warning extends to pig-ear dog treats already in homes, with the CDC warning that \"handling these treats could make people sick; eating the treats could make dogs sick.\" Tests have identified \"many different strains in salmonella in pig ears from various brands and suppliers,\" according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC added that data on where the ill consumers had bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor or common brand of pig ear treats.\n\nSalmonella can affect animals eating contaminated products as well as the humans who handled the infected product or sickened animals. In people, the salmonella infection causes symptoms including nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. In rare cases, it can cause more serious ailments. Affected pets may become lethargic and have diarrhea, fever and vomiting.\n\nStates impacted by the outbreak\n\nIllnesses in the outbreak have been reported in the following 35 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\nConsumers who have purchased the treats distributed by Dog Goods should return them to the place of purchase for a refund. Those with questions can call at 786-401-6533 extension 8000 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST.\n\nThe recall involves the following lot codes:", "description": "Food safety regulators warn that the tainted pet products can make both owners and their pets seriously ill", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/29aa1bec-2f12-4797-b484-43a776618d01/thumbnail/1200x630/62a8e45ee53a7d601b33a37ab0a207fd/gettyimages-982758986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
