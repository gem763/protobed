Hundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave. And the people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up.\u201d\n\n\"The people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nEarlier this week, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and several California mayors and county and state officials asked the Trump administration for 50,000 additional vouchers for those most affected by the housing crisis, the Los Angeles Times reported. In the letter signed Monday, they also requested the federal government provide incentives for landlords to accept the housing vouchers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty remarkable opportunity, if they\u2019re sincere in their desires,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cIf they\u2019re insincere and this is, God forbid, about something else \u2014 politics, not good policy \u2014 then they\u2019ll reject it outright. I hope that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s two-day fundraising trip to California has been met with protests and swift criticism from celebrities aiming to prevent him from awakening Republican support in the Democrat stronghold state ahead of 2020. Meanwhile, officials spoke of putting political differences aside briefly enough to welcome the president in a partnership in addressing homeless in the state together.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, said in a Facebook video post ahead of Trump's arrival that he hoped the president would work with the city to end homelessness, but added he has not been invited to meet with the president during his stay on Los Angeles.\n\n\u200b \u200b\n\nTrump said he would discuss possible solutions to California\u2019s homelessness crisis with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson when he comes to join the president in the San Francisco Bay Area and then Los Angeles. Carson requested to meet with Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to discuss housing issues, including homelessness. They are expected to meet Wednesday.\n\nAs Trump fails to announce possible policy proposals to address homelessness on the West Coast during his California trip, local officials are speculating that Trump plans to clear homeless encampments he referenced to reporters on Air Force One and move people to government operated shelters on federal land, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe Department of Justice and Los Angeles law enforcement union officials deliberated possible \u201cworkarounds\u201d to circumvent court settlements, rulings and lawsuits that hinder the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s ability to clear homeless encampments from public property, according to the newspaper. On Monday, the White House also considered the option of deregulating the housing market to increase the supply of apartments, condominiums and homes in California.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump kicked off his two-day California fundraising trip Tuesday with a $3 million Bay Area luncheon at the home of Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy, to be followed by a $5 million Beverly Hills dinner at the home of real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer.
