Police last weekend fired water cannon at a group of people standing outside a mosque and journalists have been wounded in the clashes.\n\nThe programming staff union of public broadcaster RTHK said on Monday it had called on police to identify officers who \"attacked and ripped the face mask\" off one of its journalists on Sunday.

It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nTourists numbers have plummeted, with visitor numbers down nearly 50 percent in October, a decline Chan called an \"emergency.\"\n\nRetail operators, from prime shopping malls to family-run businesses, have been forced to close for multiple days over the past few months.\n\nWhile authorities have announced measures to support local small and medium seized enterprises, Chan said the measures could only \"slightly reduce the pressure.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"Let citizens return to normal life, let industry and commerce operate normally, and create more space for rational dialog,\" he wrote.\n\n(Reporting by Farah Master and Twinnie Sui; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "description": "TV footage showed protesters setting fires to street barricades and squirting petrol from plastic bottles on to fires at subway entrances.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19300498371072-e1572191425840.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
