The channel is widely available in Saudi Arabia but Riyadh has previously said it is not based there and that Saudi authorities are committed to fighting piracy.\n\nBeIN Sports said in February it had not renewed its Formula One contract for the Middle East and North Africa as a result of piracy. The sport is now broadcast free to air in the region under a five-year deal with MBC Group.\n\nAl-Obaidly told the summit that the industry was refusing to confront the \u201cpiracy elephant\u201d in the room and make attempts to tackle the problem.\n\n\u201cThe glorious media rights bubble is about to burst. And ... the truth is that our industry is completely unprepared,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your house in order and quickly, the sports rights market will disintegrate beyond recognition. In fact, winter is already here.\u201d", "description": "The sports media rights \"bubble\" is about to burst because of global broadcast piracy and the business model will have to be overhauled, the head of Qatar-based beIN Media Group said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
