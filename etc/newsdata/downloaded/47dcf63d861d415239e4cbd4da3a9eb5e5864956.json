Seemingly flying in the face of the Swedish identity, the move, passed by one vote, has divided the city.\n\nWith its elite residents including ABBA\u2019s Bjorn Ulvaeus, Liding\u00f6 is only the seventh municipality in all of Sweden to ban begging, and the idea still makes many Swedes uncomfortable.\n\nRead more\n\nIn a country whose very identity is tied up with its robust universal welfare state and which for years had what was considered Europe\u2019s most welcoming attitude to outsiders, the decision came as a bit of shock. Some outraged locals have called it a violation of human rights. Others, however, said it\u2019s necessary to keep the well-heeled residents safe.\n\n\u201cThe begging is a big problem and makes many Liding\u00f6 people feel insecure,\u201d Daniel K\u00e4llenfors, chairman of the municipal council, told Dagens Nyheter on Monday, after the measure was passed.\n\nOpponents of the ban say it merely pushes the problem into other municipalities and scoff at the idea that moneyed locals feel threatened by beggars. \u201cI have not so far found any Liding\u00f6 residents who say they are insecure,\u201d Patrik Buddg\u00e5rd of the Center Party told DN. His party joined the Liberals to oppose the ban, which squeaked by with a vote of 26 for to 25 against.\n\nREAD MORE: Current trends in self-reproach & guilt serve interests of elites \u2013 Slavoj Zizek\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of this development,\u201d Anna Larsdotter Persson, who watched the vote from the audience, told Mitti.se, adding that she \u201cdoes not buy\u201d the idea that the ban will improve the lives of beggars and believes it is a \u201cpopulist policy\u201d masquerading as something else.\n\n\u201cI have never been so ashamed of Liding\u00f6 as I am now,\u201d Anita Dorazio, a representative for the Stockholm Asylum Committee and refugee advocate, told the outlet.\n\nRead more\n\nTheir shame \u2013 and the controversy itself \u2013 cuts to the heart of Swedish identity and the feasibility of a universal welfare state in the midst of a migration crisis. The oft-praised \u201cNordic model,\u201d a hybrid of market economy and socialist services, boasts a strong social safety net that guarantees the rights of even the most vulnerable residents.\n\nBut the beggars, in many cases that attracted publicity, are not locals. Six Bulgarians were arrested in December for trafficking nine of their countrymen to southern Sweden and forcing them to beg. The victims, including a pregnant woman who miscarried after she was assaulted by the traffickers, were fined, beaten, or starved by their \u201cemployers\u201d if they did not bring in enough cash, according to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 District Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nREAD MORE: Sweden turns Pippi Longstocking into homeless Roma migrant living in Stockholm ghetto\n\nNor are beggars the only ones feeling the chill as the famously welcoming Swedish attitude begins to curdle after years of abuse. Faced with the reality that over 418,431 asylum-seekers \u2013 and a total of 920,206 immigrants \u2013 have made their way to Sweden since the Syrian war kicked the migrant crisis into high gear, Sweden, with a population of less than 10 million, has belatedly realized that being a migration capital of Europe isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Bengtsfors, a municipality in southern Sweden, was forced to beg the government for economic help earlier this year after taking in more migrants than it could afford.\n\nRead more\n\nNearby Filipstad is facing a similar crisis as many native Swedes move out, distressed by the seemingly endless flood of unemployable African migrants, leaving the community with no tax base and unable to support the new arrivals.\n\nSwedish authorities have stopped collecting statistics comparing the ethnicity of criminals. The last published statistics, issued in 2005, found foreign-born individuals four times more likely to be homicide suspects and 4.5 times more likely to be rape suspects. Hence, it is unclear what percentage of beggars in Sweden come from outside the country.\n\nBut the first Swedish begging ban, which finally went into effect at the beginning of the year in Vellinge, a suburb of Malm\u00f6, faced 18 months of legal challenges and condemnations from NGOs calling it \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cxenophobic\u201d \u2013 suggesting that most of the beggars there are foreign-born. Under that law, beggars are given a verbal warning, then physically removed, and only after repeat offenses apprehended by police. The Moderate Party has campaigned to ban begging nationwide, and a survey by state broadcaster SVT found at least 40 other municipalities are keen to adopt their own bans. But these measures seem less a solution than a tiny band-aid on the gaping flesh wound caused by ill-thought-out immigration policy \u2013 and also one that makes Swedes look somewhat hypocritical, to boot.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Hasn\u2019t it gone too far now?\u2019 TV ad in migrant\u2019s native language enrages Swedish social media\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Liding\u00f6, a tony area whose residents include ABBA and other celebrities, has become the first in Stockholm to ban begging.
