This means all mosques, temples, most Christian churches, and thousands of colleges and schools would all lose this special status if they support solely traditional marriage.\n\n\"There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\" O\u2019Rourke told Don Lemon. \"And so, as president, we\u2019re going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\"\n\nVideo: With a tee-up from CNN's Don Lemon, Beto O'Rourke says to cheers and applause that he will target churches and any organization that doesn't fully accept the LGBTQ agenda receives \"reward, no benefit, no tax break,\" and loses their tax-exempt status #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/WQ9J0BFzsZ \u2014 Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 11, 2019\n\nWalter Olson of the Cato Institute broke down why O'Rourke's posturing is both immoral as well as illegal. Here's his Twitter thread:\n\n\"A long line of court opinions has made clear that 1) 'tax exemptions can\u2019t be denied based on the viewpoint that a group communicates.'\" \"Support,\" the term used in the question, = viewpoint. /2 #CatoSCOTUS https://t.co/H7esvWNPbv \u2014 Walter Olson (@walterolson) October 11, 2019\n\nEvery single liberal Justice joined in defense of church autonomy in that case. Want to revoke the tax exemption of churches or religious orgs? That, you might do -- provided you revoke the exemptions of pro-gay or progressive churches on the same neutral basis. /4 #CatoSCOTUS \u2014 Walter Olson (@walterolson) October 11, 2019", "description": ".10/11/2019 15:45:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/01c44d5e-eb6d-4d92-9297-0e1c7ae1cd4c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
