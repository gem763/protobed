Her 12-year-old son was in her vehicle with her at the time.\n\nThe following day, police went to her home in Croughton to tell her that Dunn had died in the hospital \u2014 and lawyers and U.S. embassy officials advised her to take off, according to the outlets.\n\nA U.S. embassy in London spokesperson and the U.S. State Department confirmed the woman and her family had left the U.K.\n\nThe State Department confirmed the driver was the spouse of a U.S. diplomat assigned to the U.K., but wouldn\u2019t confirm their identities, or reveal the husband\u2019s title.\n\nImmunity usually only covers diplomats and their dependents based in London. But there is a special arrangement, in place since 1994, for diplomats working at RAF Croughton, according to Sky News.\n\nLocal authorities and the victim\u2019s family have been pleading for the woman to be sent back to face charges.\n\nA senior officer in the Northamptonshire police force wrote to the embassy urging them to waive diplomatic immunity \u201cin order to allow the justice process to take place.\u201d\n\nAnd Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dominic Raab said he asked U.S. ambassador Woody Johnson to waive immunity too, but was declined.\n\nThe victim\u2019s parents, Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles on Saturday, pleaded with President Trump to intervene.\n\nThis story originally appeared at NYPost.com", "description": "The wife of an American diplomat who allegedly fled the U.K. to avoid charges in a wrong-way crash that killed a British teenager was identified in a report...", "authors": ["Tamar Lapin"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS754_woody__ZG_20191007054753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
