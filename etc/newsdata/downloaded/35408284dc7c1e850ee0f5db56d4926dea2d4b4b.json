Photo: Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros.\n\nFor its first two acts, Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker is a social-realist drama that just so happens to be set in Gotham City. It\u2019s the story of a troubled working-class man who crumbles under the depredation of an uncaring society, a plot inspired more by Martin Scorsese and Paddy Chayefsky than Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Of course, movies like that rarely make $93 million in their opening weekends, so the third act dutifully chronicles exactly how aspiring comedian Arthur Fleck becomes the green-haired supervillain of DC Comics lore. However, along the way, there\u2019s a twist: Arthur has a severe mental illness, and over the course of the film the audience gradually learns that many things we thought we were seeing were not actually happening. Still trying to sort through it all? Let\u2019s discuss which parts of the film we think were \u201creal,\u201d and which were delusions.\n\nArthur\u2019s romance with his neighbor Sophie.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the most obvious one: If Sophie\u2019s confusion upon seeing Arthur in her apartment didn\u2019t catch you onto the fact that their relationship was all in his head, the movie helpfully flashes back to show us that Arthur was imagining her presence the whole time! (Bless this movie for swerving around one hoary romantic trope and plowing straight into another.) After Arthur\u2019s reveries during the Murray Franklin show, the Sophie revelation confirms that even the movie\u2019s supposedly straightforward scenes must not be taken as objective reality, and introduces us to the parlor game of guessing what else in the movie might be a fantasy. If you\u2019re curious, this was also the scene that inspired the whole incel mishegoss: In the early version of the script that leaked online, Sophie\u2019s interactions with Arthur were real but platonic, and he flew into a rage after seeing her have sex with another man. Cutting that out was one of Phillips\u2019s rare acts of restraint.\n\nArthur walks out of Sophie\u2019s apartment, seemingly without incident.\n\nThis one is less a question of whether we can believe what we\u2019re seeing, and more a question of what we can infer from what we didn\u2019t see. After a frightened Sophie asks Arthur to leave her living room, the film cuts to a shot of him walking back to his own apartment. We never see Sophie again after that, leaving some viewers to infer that she was one of Arthur\u2019s many victims. I\u2019m not sure I buy it, but the ambiguity does fit the film\u2019s penchant for having it both ways \u2014 the movie gets to raise the specter of Arthur doing something terrible to Sophie, without having to deal with the consequences of showing him actually do it.\n\nAfter unveiling his new persona as Joker on the Murray Franklin show, Arthur is taken away by the police, but escapes when his acolytes plow an ambulance into the cop car. Once freed, he exults in their adulation.\n\nTalk about send in the clowns! Although in this case, ought there to be clowns? There\u2019s no explicit indication that Joker\u2019s moment of triumph is anything other than what it seems, but some viewers have seen what they think are hints that it should not be taken at face value. As the character\u2019s grand apotheosis, it\u2019s exactly the same sort of wish fulfillment as Arthur\u2019s other delusions, and if the clown protesters are bound and determined to keep Joker out of jail, how come he\u2019s in Arkham Asylum in the very next scene?\n\nThe final scene in Arkham\n\nAfter I saw Joker, I was convinced that the movie\u2019s final scene was a flashback to Arthur\u2019s first stint in Arkham \u2014 showing that he was a violent threat even before the events of the film, and putting to lie all of his talk about being driven to evil by society, man. Admittedly, this hunch was based on little more than the fact that Arthur\u2019s hair was black, not green, in the scene, and my powers of observation were dulled somewhat by the fact that I was packing up my things to go and not really paying attention. But still, think about it! Unfortunately, when I attempted to explain this fan theory to my co-workers, David Edelstein reminded me that the therapist in Arkham mentions the death of Thomas Wayne, which means it can\u2019t be a flashback. Oh well. I guess I have a lot to learn about hair dye.\n\nEverything after the fridge scene.\n\nIn the world\u2019s most unexpected callback to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, late in the film Arthur becomes so distraught that he climbs into his own fridge. The Ringer\u2019s Andrew Gruttadaro proposes that everything after this point is \u201ca near-death hallucination\u201d brought about by the lack of oxygen inside the appliance. It\u2019s an interesting theory, but it comes with an unexpected wrinkle: If you make a movie about Joker, but the part where he becomes Joker is all a dream, did you really make a movie about Joker?\n\nThe entire third act of the movie.\n\nNot to be outdone, there are those who consider the entire last half-hour of the movie to have taken place entirely in Arthur\u2019s head. However, as my colleague Bilge Ebiri pointed out, this would mean that Arthur had a delusion of Sophie inside his existing delusion. Still, I don\u2019t want to rule this one out entirely \u2014 if you\u2019re already cribbing from the masters, what\u2019s one more Chris Nolan movie?", "description": "Did Joker kill his neighbor?
