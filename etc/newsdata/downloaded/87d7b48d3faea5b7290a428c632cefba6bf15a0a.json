He also reiterated Iran\u2019s security plan for the region, which included calling on Saudi Arabia to work with all other nations in the region, after first introducing it during the UN General Assembly last month.\n\nWill these efforts end the cold war in the region?\n\nIt is early to tell. Many experts however don\u2019t seem optimistic, sighting that many extremists on both sides will likely try to sabotage any potential dialogue between the two nations.\n\nOn Friday morning, Iran\u2019s State-run IRNA agency said an Iranian-owned oil tanker was hit by two missiles in the Red Sea near the city of Jeddah off Saudi Arabia\u2019s coast.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the work of a third party, and this party could well come from inside Iran,\u201d said Andreas Krieg, assistant professor of defence studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThis is someone who doesn\u2019t support Zarif\u2019s security initative,\u201d he added.\n\nThe recent attack is unlikely to lead to further escalation in the tensions, mostly because the two countries seem willing, more than before, to give mediation a real chance, and the US does not support ratcheting up tensions too.\n\n\u201cWhoever did this is trying to put liability\u201d on Khan\u2019s mediating efforts, Krieg said, adding that Islamabad sees these talks as a window of opportunity to bring the two parties together.\n\nWhy is it so difficult to see a breakthrough soon?\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in several proxy wars over influence all over the Middle East, which have deepened the sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shias throughout the past decade. Iran backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, a wide range of Shia militias in Iraq, the Shia majority in Bahrain and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia feels strategically vulnerable and surrounded from all sides by Iran\u2019s supporters. It, too, has long given its backing to Sunni political parties in Lebanon, the Syrian opposition and formed a coalition with the UAE to prop up the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAnalysts say that convincing Tehran and Riyadh to negotiate some kind of settlement needs a major change to happen first on the ground, and collective efforts on the international stage.\n\n\u201cThis is more of a tactical move than a strategic choice,\u201d Cinzia Bianco, Gulf researcher fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations said, adding \u201cit\u2019s a short time action to mitigate the impact of any further attacks, rather than a beginning of a comprehensive long-term process.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia, in particular, seems ready for a small, but significant, change in its alliances after the attack on Abqaiq oil facility, which is widely seen as a tipping point in the Saudi strategic options.\n\nWhat other options do the Saudis have?\n\nA straightforward choice: Russia. President Vladimir Putin is due to visit both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in coming days to discuss a wide range of investments and energy deals. However, some experts predict the talks may include defence deals and perhaps a Russian involvement in protecting Saudi strategic facilities.\n\n\u201cAfter the attack on Abqaiq the Saudis were expecting a reaction, especially from the US, probably in the form of a protection umbrella for infrastructure with international significance, but this reaction has never come,\u201d said Bianco. \u201cI think now they are seriously looking into other options. They will no longer put their eggs in one basket,\u201d she added.\n\nThe United States announced the deployment of additional American military forces to Saudi Arabia on Friday including fighter squadrons, an air expeditionary wing and air defense personnel. Together with the 200 forces to Saudi Arabia announced last month, the deployment totaled about 3,000 troops, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe American deployment of troops comes before Putin's visit to the Gulf, which the US looks at with caution. Russia has always tried to take a distance away from the dispute in the Gulf, keeping the conversation limited to two main issues: energy and investments. But last month, Putin offered help to defend Saudi Arabia by selling it the advanced S-400 anti-aircraft system after the attack that halted half of its crude oil production.\n\nPutin\u2019s visit to the Gulf highlights the deep disappointment in the US leadership by its closest allies, in the wake of the Turkish military incursion into northeast Syria, after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from the region, leaving the Kurds, the US\u2019s strongest allies in the fight against Isis, vulnerable.\n\nAlthough Imran Khan has a mandate from Trump, reaching a breakthrough in the short term, which would probably give Trump a win abroad, still seems unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis and Iranians will eventually engage in a dialogue, mainly on maritime security and maybe Yemen, but this is a long process which is unlikely to be seen anytime soon\u201d, Bianco said.", "description": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister Imran Khan is due to hold talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0to discuss a possible cooling of tensions\u00a0between Iran and Saudi Arabia, after Islamabad confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s request to mediate between the Middle East\u2019s biggest rivals.
