The fraudulent account even spelled Voight's name wrong, calling him John instead of Jon.\n\nNo less than seven minutes after Trump's retweet, Twitter deleted the original post and suspended the account, presumably for impersonation, which left Trump's tweet blank.\n\nThe President retweeted the post thanking the actor, calling him 'John' misspelling his name. No less than seven minutes after Trump's retweet, Twitter deleted the original post and suspended the account, presumably for impersonation, which left Trump's tweet blank\n\nTrump was duped by a posting from this fake account pretending to be actor Jon Voight\n\nIn the past, Jon Voight actor has expressed his support for President Trump, declaring him 'the greatest president of this century'. Voight, pictured right, is one of the very few outspoken conservative actors in Hollywood who openly support the President\n\nThe Twitter mix-up is another social media blunder for the president who frequently misspells words or wrongly links people's Twitter accounts in his own posts.\n\nIn this particular instance, there were a number of giveaways that all was not what it seemed.\n\nFirstly, the retweet was from a fake account that spelled the actors' name incorrectly and the impostor only had a few hundred followers.\n\nTwitter introduced a policy earlier this year that allows world leaders to break its rules without being penalized or getting suspended as long as the company deems the tweets to be in the 'public interest.'\n\nHowever, the company said it would take action on tweets from world leaders that promote terrorism or include direct threats of violence made against an individual.\n\nTwitter said in June it would place labels on tweets from world leaders that break its rules explaining why the tweet hadn't been removed entirely from the platform.\n\nJust seven minutes later, the rogue account had been suspended after Twitter was alerted to the fact that it was impersonating the actor\n\nIt didn't take long before Twitter users were calling out the president for being duped by the fake account.\n\n'Looks like our stable genius president @realDonaldTrump did an oopsie and retweeted a video from a fake @JonVoight account that is now suspended,' wrote one.\n\n'Gosh, you are one dumb president... this is a fake/poser job Voight tweeter .... wait you are dumb, fake poster president' added another.\n\n'You wonder how Trump could get owned by every Dictator there is? He's out here thinking a bot with 200 followers is the real John Voight. LOL.' said another Twitter user.\n\nIn the past, the actor has often expressed his support for President Trump, declaring him 'the greatest president of this century' in a message posted on Twitter in August.\n\nVoight is one of the very few outspoken conservative actors in Hollywood who openly support the President and in May called him 'the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.'\n\nIt wasn't long before Twitter users were calling out the President for being duped by the fake\n\nSunday also began with an error-laden morning tweet from the President as he attributed a statement about the U.S.-Turkey ceasefire to his Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper.\n\nBut in a mistake that quickly sparked a trending hashtag, he called the top military official 'Mark Esperanto.'\n\nTrump wrote: 'Mark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense, 'The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds.' USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!'\n\nThe tweet was shared thousands of times before being deleted.", "description": "The President retweeted the post thanking the actor 'John', without realize the account was fake.
