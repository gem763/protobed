Washington had won its previous eight playoffs contests this month and will look to take a 3-1 series lead in Game 4 on Saturday at 8:07 p.m. The Nationals left 12 on base.\n\nRobinson Chirinos, the Houston catcher, hit a solo homer off Washington starter and loser Anibal Sanchez to give the Astros a 4-1 lead in the sixth inning.\n\nSanchez, who had not pitched in two weeks, went 5 1/3 innings and allowed four runs on 10 hits before Fernando Rodney took over in the sixth.\n\nWashington left two runners on base in the sixth, went down in order in the seventh, left a runner on base in the eighth and went down in the ninth against Houston reliever Roberto Osuna.\n\nThe closer was suspended last year in a domestic abuse case and was booed heavily when his name was announced, but retired Juan Soto for the last out on strikes with Adam Eaton on base after a single.\n\nThe Astros, who hit the ball hard all night against Sanchez, took a 1-0 lead in the second on an RBI single by Josh Reddick to score Carlos Correa, who had doubled with one out.\n\nHouston made it 2-0 in the third as Jose Altuve led off with a double and took third on an error by left fielder Soto.\n\nAltuve then scored on a single by Michael Brantley.\n\nVictor Robles had an RBI triple down the left-field line as the Nationals trimmed the lead to 2-1 against Houston starter Zack Greinke. His hit scored veteran Ryan Zimmerman, who walked with no outs in his first World Series home game in a career that began in 2005.\n\nHouston took a 3-1 lead in the fifth as Altuve doubled and scored on a single by Michael Brantley.\n\nWashington catcher Kurt Suzuki had to leave the game in the sixth after he was nicked by a pitch on defense. Yan Gomes came on to catch for the Nationals, who have just two catchers on the World Series roster.\n\nWashington will turn to veteran lefty Patrick Corbin, who will make the start Saturday in the very environment he wanted when he signed as a free agent before this season. Corbin has been used out of the bullpen as well in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThis time worked out pretty well for us being able to throw Game 1 and then having three full days off,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cSo I was able to do the same routine, everything that I would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always say they compete every four days to get ready for that fifth day,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said of his starting pitchers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
