I fully believe it,\u201d he wrote in the photos\u2019 caption. \u201cI have not seen a single salmon in a river so far. The bears are starving and it breaks my heart seeing this unfold.\"\n\n\u201cI believe it is important to show this side too,\u201d Mr Hicker continued. \u201cHere in the Broughton is no salmon left for the bears (and whales I must assume?). Advertising still shows the happy bears feasting on salmon, well, sorry to say - not here. We saw this sow with her two little ones a couple of weeks ago and then we saw her again only a few days ago. I have no idea how she would make it through the winter without salmon.\u201d\n\nMr Hicker is correct about the salmon run. In August, a report released by Fisheries and Oceans Canada said that the country\u2019s climate is warming twice as fast as the global average. The doubled time is drastically impacting salmon, which in turn impacts the bears who feed on the fish.\n\nMarine heatwaves, increased floods, and droughts were also listed by the report as stresses on the salmon ecosystem.\n\nRead more\n\nCoffee could become rare luxury as farms hit by climate change\n\nJake Smith, a guardian watchman manager for the Mamalilikula First Nation, which monitors the bears in the area, told CNN that the bears \u201care in trouble\u201d.
