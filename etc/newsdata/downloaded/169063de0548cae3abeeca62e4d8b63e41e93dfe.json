The regulator Ofwat has approved reductions in bills of between 5% and 15% from providers including United Utilities in its draft approvals.\n\nUnited Utilities, which is expected to deliver an 11%, or 49 pound cut on prices, on Wednesday said it is continuing talks with the regulator.", "description": "United Utilities Group Plc on Wednesday forecast higher first-half underlying profit and revenue, but the water provider said it expects debt to rise because of a repayment to its pension scheme and the impact of new reporting standards.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
