I feel that we've become more of a nation of coffee drinkers,\" she says.\n\nAnother reason for the fall in demand is that many younger people are trying to reduce their intake of dairy amid concerns about the industry's impact on the environment.\n\nImage copyright Fran Mcmonagle Image caption Lifestyle blogger Fran Mcmonagle, 28, says that millennials are much more into coffee\n\n\"Dairy alternatives don't go as well in cups of tea. The texture of soy milk and almond milk are completely different, so it changes the cup of tea, making it thicker or more watery,\" Ms Mcmonagle adds. \"In coffee, I find it's not as noticeable.\"\n\nPlus, a renewed demand for afternoon tea has led to people serving their own version at home, using expensive teas purchased from upmarket tea shops and independent brands.\n\nMs Mcmonagle also says that the rise of Instagram means that beverages need to make a big impact so that people want to take a photo of them.\n\n\"People are more likely to post a photo of their iced latte or Unicorn Frappuccino - a viral drink made popular by Starbucks in the US - and share it with their friends, than a standard cup of tea.\"\n\nThe UK has also seen an explosion of demand for bubble tea in 2019, with new shops popping up in several UK cities.\n\nNicholas Phan, 30, is the founder of the Biju Bubble Tea Room chain in London, which has seen its sales triple over the last three years.\n\nHe started the brand in 2014 after noting that although bubble tea was available in the UK, there wasn't much choice, and the teas were often made using stale black tea that had been stored for hours, as well as non-dairy creamer.\n\nImage copyright Biju Image caption Bubble tea is now so popular it can be found all over London\n\nBiju focuses instead on using a range of freshly-brewed loose leaf black, green and herbal teas, fresh milk, as well as vegan milks and a variety of toppings.\n\nTraditionally bubble tea shops focus on making the orders as quickly as possible and automating the process using machines to get customers in and out of the shop in as little time as they can. Many popular Asian brands have franchises in the UK now using this model.\n\nIn contrast, Biju encourages teenagers to stay and hang out with their friends, and the drinks are all made manually.\n\n\"It was a risk, but it actually helps the business when the shop is full and the vibe is good,\" Mr Phan says.\n\n\"When we started the brand we wanted to be more sophisticated and different. The more people who hang out, the better. The shops draw in a lot of new customers who see people inside and want to try the experience.\"\n\nImage copyright Biju Image caption Biju's founder Nicholas Pham said his tea room's potential as a hang out spot for young people had helped to drive sales and demand\n\nGiven all the new teas available on the market, a resurgence of the traditional cuppa is unlikely, believes Ms Mcmonagle.\n\n\"The builder's brew is quite old school, it's not necessarily a brand that anyone associates with being modern anymore,\" she says.", "description": "Demand for builder's tea is falling, while coffee and herbal teas are becoming popular.", "authors": ["Mary-Ann Russon", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14620/production/_109288438_tea-milk-cookies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
