Researchers have tried to decipher those details by comparing the physical features of living and fossilized moths. But it\u2019s \u201cextremely difficult to estimate\u201d how fast such features evolve, says Adriana Briscoe from the University of California, Irvine, and this approach tends to underestimate the timing of important evolutionary events\u2014such as the origin of ears.\n\nTo get better answers, Kawahara and his team spent years traveling around the world\u2019s nighttime forests and luring moths with ultraviolet lamps. By comparing the genes of 186 species, they created a family tree that shows how different groups are related and, crucially, when the major milestones in their evolutionary history occurred.\n\nThe closest living relatives of moths and butterflies are caddis flies, insects that spend their larval lives in the water before changing shape and taking to the air. About 300 million years ago, insects with a similar lifestyle left the water to feed on early land plants, such as mosses, liverworts, and ferns. Larvae lived inside plants, devouring them from within and eventually emerging as winged adults that flew from leaf to leaf. These were the first moths.\n\nThese creatures would probably not have spawned a dynasty of 160,000 species without two important innovations. First, about 241 million years ago, the munching jaws of the adults transformed into a coiled straw\u2014a proboscis. This allowed them to sip the nectar of flowering plants, which were then relative newcomers, only starting their long ascendance. Second, some of the caterpillars stopped mining the interiors of plants and began feasting on the surface, eating them from outside in.\n\nWith more room, they grew bigger bodies that measured in inches rather than millimeters. The larger caterpillars could walk about to find more nutritious leaves, other host plants, or places to pupate in safety. Bigger caterpillars produced bigger adults, which could fly greater distances in search of food. This likely cemented their relationship with flowering plants. \u201cThey pollinated the flowers, the plants became diverse, and the moths became diverse in synchrony,\u201d Kawahara says. His family tree shows that the two groups radiate in synchrony\u2014another classic evolutionary story and one that, mercifully, \u201cappears to be correct,\u201d he says.\n\nFlying high on flower power, moths thrived, but mostly by night. But about 98 million years ago, some of them became active in the day, and gave rise to the butterflies\u2014a group that Barber wryly describes as \u201can uninteresting diurnal group of moths.\u201d Here again, bats have been implicated. In 1999, Jayne Yack of Carleton University proposed that echolocating bats were such a threat that some moths escaped by fleeing the night entirely, shifting to daylight hours. \u201cThe butterfly, in effect, was therefore \u2018invented\u2019 by the bat,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "For 50 years, researchers have thought that moths evolved ears to detect the ultrasonic calls of attacking bats\u2014but a new study shows that ears came first.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_119474408/facebook.jpg?1571435067", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
