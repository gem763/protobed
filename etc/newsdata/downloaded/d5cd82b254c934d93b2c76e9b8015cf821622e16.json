Atkinson addressed senators at his confirmation hearing last year to become the watchdog for the nation\u2019s intelligence community, he promised a robust program to encourage whistleblowers \u2014 one that \u201cvalidates moral courage without compromising national security and without retaliation.\u201d\n\nAtkinson is slated to return to Congress on Friday after the alarms he raised from a whistleblower set in motion the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart. Atkinson is also battling for legal protections for the unnamed person who issued the complaint, whom the president has called \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cvicious.\u201d\n\nAs a former federal prosecutor in Washington, Atkinson is well suited to his high-pressure role at the epicenter of the unfolding investigation, according to former colleagues. He helped send two Democratic congressmen to prison and oversaw a sprawling campaign finance investigation involving a former D.C. mayor. Atkinson is unflappable, understated and cautious, they say, but also unafraid to speak up when he disagrees.\n\n\u201cHe plans many steps ahead; he\u2019s not impulsive. He had to have known that taking this action was going to have repercussions,\u201d said former colleague Matthew Jones, who was chief of staff to Atkinson\u2019s boss, then-U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. \u201cHe\u2019s not a person who goes out on a limb in any way.\u201d\n\nTrump picked Atkinson for inspector general of the intelligence community in late 2017, and he was confirmed in May 2018.\n\nSixteen months later, Atkinson was locked in a stalemate with the Justice Department and the acting director of national intelligence, who had refused to transmit the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress within seven days as required by law.\n\n[Whistleblower complaint about Trump involves Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter]\n\nThe law requires Atkinson to notify Congress when he is \u201cunable to resolve\u201d a difference with the intelligence director on a matter involving one of the inspector general\u2019s duties. He sent two letters to Congress in September, informing the intelligence panels that a complaint existed, and told the committees he was continuing efforts to obtain direction from acting director Joseph Maguire as to how the whistleblower could bring concerns to Congress.\n\nAtkinson then testified in a closed-door hearing, and he is scheduled to return for a follow-up session Friday with the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cIt could have all been squashed by the Justice Department, but he persisted,\u201d said Mary McCord, who worked closely with Atkinson when she led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division and Atkinson was her senior counsel, and when both were in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw that this was coming from him, that was all I needed to know to credit the report, because I know him to be a careful, thoughtful, meticulous prosecutor,\u201d McCord said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seek the limelight. He doesn\u2019t seek attention.\u201d\n\nAtkinson\u2019s notification prompted a subpoena from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to Maguire to turn over the complaint. Several days later, media reports revealed the complaint centered on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. On the call, Trump repeatedly pressed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe disclosures touched off calls from Congress for the White House to release a summary of Trump\u2019s phone call \u2014 and for the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to be made public.\n\n[Whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up]\n\nEarlier this week, Atkinson pushed back against unsubstantiated allegations in conservative media outlets \u2014 and picked up in a tweet by the president \u2014 that the whistleblower submission form had been altered to enable complaints that were not based on firsthand knowledge. The whistleblower had acknowledged in the complaint not being \u201ca direct witness\u201d in most cases.\n\nIn a statement posted online, Atkinson said the form has been in place since May 2018. There is no requirement in the law, he noted, that a complainant possess firsthand knowledge.\n\nWhistleblower attorney Bradley Moss said Atkinson, by \u201cactions including providing official counterpoints to the political spin coming out of the White House and its media allies, has done more than anyone ever imagined that a politically appointed IG could have done.\u201d\n\nAtkinson, 55, grew up in New York\u2019s Oswego County. When asked in his Senate confirmation questionnaire whether he had ever run afoul of the law, Atkinson, known as a straight-arrow with a dry wit, wrote that as a high school senior, he paid a $75 fine for illegally fishing for trout \u201cout of season, at night, and with a spear.\u201d\n\nAtkinson graduated from Syracuse University, and after law school at Cornell University he spent 11 years as a lawyer in private practice in Washington. He and his wife, the managing partner at a D.C. law firm, have two sons and live in Maryland, according to the Senate form.\n\nIt was after the 9/11 attacks that Atkinson decided to join the government.\n\n\u201cI wanted more challenges, greater responsibilities and different rewards,\u201d he said at his January 2018 hearing. \u201cAlthough my annual salary was reduced by nearly two-thirds from my time at the law firm, my sense of professional accomplishment was never higher.\u201d\n\n[Ex-Army Corps official sentenced in contracting scheme of \u2018historic proportions\u2019]\n\nInside the intelligence community leadership, Atkinson is viewed as \u201cquiet, reserved\u201d and one you \u201ctrust with investigations,\u201d said one senior U.S. intelligence official who was not authorized to comment on the record and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDuring his initial closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee last month, Atkinson focused largely on what the law requires of his office. He said he interviewed witnesses to help determine the complaint\u2019s credibility, said a person familiar with the session.\n\nAtkinson was \u201ccredible,\u201d said the individual, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed session. He was \u201cemotional in the sense that he was disturbed by being stymied and felt like he wasn\u2019t able to do his job,\u201d the person said.\n\nAtkinson brought to the task his 15 years of investigating and taking on complex, high-stakes corruption cases involving elected officials, corporate executives and government contractors. He helped prosecute former congressman William Jefferson (D-La.) in a bribery case that uncovered $90,000 hidden in foil in Jefferson\u2019s freezer.\n\nHis work led to convictions of the sons of two prominent Democrats. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the former Illinois congressman and son of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money to pay for an extravagant lifestyle. Former D.C. Council member Michael A. Brown, son of former commerce secretary Ronald H. Brown Jr., pleaded guilty the same year after he was photographed taking wads of cash in a gym bag and coffee mug from undercover federal agents.\n\nOn the other side of the courtroom from Atkinson in both cases was defense attorney Reid Weingarten. He said Atkinson, unlike other prosecutors who might have sought an overly harsh sentence or leaked details to the media, \u201chandled himself with class, intelligence, with sensitivity and with strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence was dreadful, but there was a sensitivity,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t rub it in my face.\u201d\n\n[D.C.\u2019s Gray knew of \u2018shadow campaign,\u2019 Thompson prosecutors say; mayor says it's all a lie]\n\nAs part of a far-reaching campaign finance investigation, Atkinson negotiated the plea agreement with former D.C. contractor Jeffrey Thompson. He alleged in 2014 that then-Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) knew about Thompson\u2019s unreported, illegal \u201cshadow campaign\u201d on Gray\u2019s behalf. Gray, now a D.C. Council member, was never charged, and he accused Thompson of lying. His supporters called the plea a sweetheart deal and criticized prosecutors for the timing \u2014 publicly naming Gray just weeks before he lost his primary bid for reelection.\n\nAtkinson disclosed the identity of \u201cMayoral Candidate A\u201d in court only after he was ordered to do so by the judge.\n\nHe was also the driving force in exposing a network of corrupt public officials and government contractors for the Army Corps of Engineers who stole more than $30 million through inflated billings and fake invoices.\n\nAt the sentencing for the mastermind, Atkinson urged the judge to send a message to thousands of public officials and contractors who must decide daily \u201cwhether to give in to the temptation of government corruption.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Before Michael Atkinson became inspector general for the intelligence community, he had spent years as a federal prosecutor in public corruption cases.", "authors": ["Ann E.
