The Lib Dems would win 23. This would give Johnson a majority of 44.\n\nHowever, if 30% of pro-Remain Brits vote tactically, the Conservatives would be outnumbered by parties which are committed to either holding a new referendum and/or staying in the EU.\n\nThe Tories would win 309 seats, Labour would return 233 seats, Jo Swinson's Lib Dems would win 34 seats, Plaid Crymu would win four, and the Greens would win one. Remain majority = four.\n\nBut the Remain majority would be 36 if 40% of Remainers voted tactically.\n\nThe Conservatives would win 277 seats, Corbyn's Labour would win 255 seats, the Lib Dems would win 44, Plaid Cymru would win four, while the Greens would win one.\n\nPollsters expect an unpredictable election\n\nBest For Britain and Hope Not Hate want opposition parties to embrace tactical voting at the election.\n\nJohnson's Conservatives are the current favourites to win the election, with polls giving them an average 10-point lead.\n\nHowever, volatility among the electorate is at a historical high, with huge shifts in voting intention over the past year.\n\nAs a result, one polling expert, Chris Curtis from YouGov, told Business Insider this week that there were several reasons to believe that \"tactical voting could be more effective\" than in previous elections.\n\nThere is now \"very low partisan alignment\" among voters, Curtis said, meaning that the way people voted in the 2016 EU referendum is now a bigger factor in deciding their vote, than which party they backed in the last general election.\n\nAccording to one recent poll, around a quarter of voters plan to vote tactically in this election.", "description": "There will be an anti-Brexit majority in the House of Commons if Remain voters vote tactically, new research suggests.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db995cbdee019507e791692?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
