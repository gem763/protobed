There are 3 central-bank rate decisions, inflation reports, U.S. , , Chinese PMIs and a number of other market-moving economic reports on the calendar. Monday was a quiet start but strong gains in stocks and corresponding rally in is a sign that investors are approaching the week with a positive attitude. This sentiment is driven by the European Union\u2019s offer to extend the Brexit deadline by 3 months and President Trump\u2019s comment that a China trade pact could be signed at the APEC meeting next month in Chile. Brexit and U.S.-China trade tensions have been the two biggest risks for the global economy this year and while neither disappeared completely, today\u2019s developments are a sign that they are moving in the right direction. With the hitting fresh record highs, investors are clearly pleased.\n\nThey are also encouraged by the prospect of a Federal Reserve later this week.

Even though the UK Parliament rejected Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s request for an early election, the market was pleased that the European Union offered the UK a 3-month extension that included an option to leave earlier. They also ruled out further negotiating over the withdrawal agreement, which is pretty the terms that Johnson was hoping for. The UK now has a clear path forward and while Johnson is pushing for another election after his December poll, the focus now should be on the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. In the near term we expect a relief rally in sterling but in the long run, the economy will suffer from Brexit.\n\nIt was no surprise that the weakest currencies today were the funding currencies, the and . However the also failed to benefit from the improvement in risk appetite. This is unusual because the improvement in U.S.-China trade relations should benefit NZD.
