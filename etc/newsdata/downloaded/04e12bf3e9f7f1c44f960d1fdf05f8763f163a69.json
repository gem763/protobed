It was a welcome result against a team fifth in the Fifa rankings, especially after the US were beaten by Mexico 3-0 at the weekend.\n\n\u201cInternally we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re moving in the right direction and that things are progressing forward,\u201d Morris said.\n\nInternational football: 10 talking points from the latest round of games Read more\n\nBrian Rodriguez, a 19-year-old Los Angeles FC forward, put Uruguay ahead off a counterattack in the 50th minute. Rodriguez took a pass from Federico Valverde, dribbled past Aaron Long and beat Brad Guzan at his near post for his first international goal.\n\nMorris scored after Jose Gimenez\u2019s failed clearance dropped in front of an open goal. Morris chested the ball in for his sixth international goal, his first since the 2017 Gold Cup final against Jamaica. Morris tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in February 2018 while playing with Seattle and did not return to the national team until March 2019.\n\nU.S. Soccer MNT (@USMNT) However it comes, you love to see it!\n\n\n\nHave a look at @JmoSmooth13\u2019s equalizer! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u26bd\ufe0f\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/imUDAQHdfk\n\n\u201cI knew that I needed to get in and take a chance and was just fortunate that the ball landed where it did,\u201d Morris said. \u201cComing off a long injury last year, it\u2019s nice to get back on the scoresheet.\u201d\n\nMorris\u2019 goal came after the US had failed to score in their previous two games. \u201cIt was about the tenacity of our guys, the relentlessness of our guys to hang in there and keep battling,\u201d US coach Gregg Berhalter said. \u201cOverall, I think it was a good step for this group to be able to play a game like this.\u201d\n\nJosh Sargent, an emerging 19-year-old forward from O\u2019Fallon, Missouri, had about 65 family and friends on hand to watch him play in his hometown, where he sat in the stands for a 2015 World Cup qualifier. His header in first-half injury time hit Gimenez\u2019s hand, but Costa Rican referee Ricardo Montero did not award a penalty kick. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dream to play like this in front of my home fans,\u201d Sargent said.\n\nBoth teams fielded weakened sides. For the US, Christian Pulisic and Zack Steffen returned to their European clubs last weekend. Uruguay\u2019s squad did not include star forwards Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani or midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro.", "description": "With both teams missing many of their regular starters, the United States displayed some style and flair against Uruguay", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa49cb3d5782d9caed1b8a81600edab997abff9/0_284_2948_1768/master/2948.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b8489479ae0d3519dbf724f8b4959b1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
