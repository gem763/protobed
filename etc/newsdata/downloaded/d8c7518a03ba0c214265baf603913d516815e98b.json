But it\u2019s not at all clear that Trump broke any laws in the Ukraine matter. In the face of a vigorous Republican defense, any argument on that question is likely to end inconclusively\u2026\n\nThe problem is that the campaign finance question is highly debatable. The Democratic case is this: Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate allegations that Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden were involved in corruption in Ukraine. Any information Zelensky provided to Trump would be a \u201cthing of value\u201d and thus an illegal foreign campaign contribution.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absurd,\u201d Bradley Smith, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and a frequent critic of campaign finance laws, said in an email exchange. \u201cIf \u2018anything of value\u2019 were interpreted so broadly, it would mean that foreign governments are consistently violating the ban in foreign spending, whenever they take official actions that may benefit one candidate or another. Similarly, Americans would have to report such activity to the FEC. That is clearly not the law.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Columnists In-Trump-Impeachment-No-One-Is-Above-The-Law-Could-Backfire-On-Democrats"], "top_image": ""}
