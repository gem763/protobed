POLITICO first reported the drop last week, and CBP posted the official statistics Monday.\n\nMorgan said Mexico has taken \u201cmeaningful and unprecedented steps\u201d to stop migrants passing through its country, \"but they need to do more.\"\n\nThe border chief added that the U.S. continues to discuss a possible safe third-country asylum deal with Mexico \u2014 a step the Mexican government thus far has rejected. Morgan said it was in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of migrants to apply for asylum in the first nation where it\u2019s possible, though advocates contend asylum seekers could be vulnerable in Mexico.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest challenge to Mexico comes before a planned meeting Tuesday between top U.S. and Mexican officials to discuss the efficacy of efforts to reduce migrant traffic.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Trump responded by threatening to hammer Mexican goods with escalating tariffs \u2014 a challenge to the administration of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist who took office in December, that sent Mexican officials rushing to Washington in June.\n\nThe two countries brokered a deal that required Mexico to deploy thousands of troops from its newly formed National Guard to intercept migrants. At the same time, the Trump administration moved to implement its \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program across the entire southwest border. The initiative forces certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in that country pending the resolution of their asylum cases.\n\nBorder arrests plummeted in the months that followed \u2014 a trend experts attributed to the new counter-migration measures.\n\nMexico says it has deployed 25,000 guard members to its northern and southern borders, although they deal with a wider range of issues than immigration crimes.\n\nMorgan confirmed Monday that more than 42,000 non-Mexican migrants have been sent to Mexico under the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201c program, which is formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, a figure first reported by POLITICO on Sunday.\n\nMorgan dodged a question about possible violence that asylum seekers could face while waiting in Mexico.\n\n\"The cartels are exploiting them from Day 1,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan touted the administration\u2019s progress building 65 miles of what he called \u201cnew wall,\u201d even though the structures actually replaced existing miles of border barriers. Overall, Morgan said the administration aims to build up to 500 miles of wall before the end of 2020.\n\nAsked whether the Trump administration has abandoned the idea that Mexico will pay for the border wall, Morgan said, \"I don't care. That's political. That's for politicians to decide.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The border chief added that the U.S. continues to discuss a possible safe third country asylum deal with Mexico.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4c/eb/fdb937e64a78980754a08951bfac/190528-mark-morgan-2-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
