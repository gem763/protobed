This is an important step towards creating a zero carbon healthcare system fit for the 21st century,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the researchers warned that people with asthma should not stop using their regular medication, but should instead discuss their options with a medical professional.\n\n\"It's important to stress that patients shouldn't stop using their usual treatments to reduce their carbon footprint,\" Alexander Wilkinson, respiratory medicine consultant and author of the study, said.\n\n\"Instead we recommend patients review their condition and treatment at least annually with their healthcare professional and at this point discuss whether a more environmentally-friendly inhaler is available and appropriate in their situation.\"\n\nExperts warned that switching to a different type of inhaler must not come at the expense of asthma sufferers' health.\n\n\"We recognize the need to protect the environment, but it's critically important that people with asthma receive the medicines they need to stay well and avoid a life-threatening asthma attack,\" Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK, said in a statement.\n\n\"Switching to a different type of inhaler can be complicated for people with asthma, as it involves learning a new inhaler technique, so it should only be done with support from a GP or asthma nurse,\" she added.", "description": "Asthma sufferers could sharply reduce their carbon footprint by swapping commonly used inhalers for \"greener\" alternatives, a study from the University of Cambridge has found.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191030123900-asthma-inhaler-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
