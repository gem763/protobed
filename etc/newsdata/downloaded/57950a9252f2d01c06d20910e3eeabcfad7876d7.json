Its owners, the Green family, are prominent Christian evangelicals and, under the guidance of the Hobby Lobby president, Steve Green, were behind the founding of Washington\u2019s $400m Museum of the Bible in 2017.\n\nA statement published by the Egypt Exploration Society, which manages the Papyri project, claimed it was told by the Museum of the Bible that 11 fragments were sold to it by Obbink in two batches in 2010.\n\nThe society and the university confirmed Obbink was under investigation. He continues to be employed at Oxford. The Guardian has contacted him for comment.\n\nThe lecturer in papyrology and Greek literature has previously denied some of the allegations, telling the Daily Beast in 2018 that the claim he sold a fragment of the first chapter of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby was not true.\n\nIn its statement, the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the collection and conducted the investigation, said the issue had contributed to Obbink\u2019s removal as general editor of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project \u201cbecause of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn June 2019 the [society] banned him from any access to its collection pending his satisfactory clarification of the 2013 contract [for another fragment sale]. Oxford University is now investigating, with [the society\u2019s help], the removal from university premises and alleged sale of [society] texts.\u201d\n\nThe statement said file records relating to the missing fragments had also been removed. \u201cThese texts were taken without authorisation from the EES, and in most of the 13 cases the catalogue card and photograph are also missing.\u201d\n\nThe statement follows intensive investigations after reports in the Daily Beast this year speculated about the possibility that Obbink had sold a highly prized fragment \u2013 if it is real \u2013 of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby and the Green family.\n\nThe report quoted a blogpost by the New Testament scholar Brent Nongbri, who published an email sent by Michael Holmes of the Museum of the Bible appearing to confirm that \u201cObbink sold [the fragment of Mark] and three other allegedly early gospel fragments to the Green collection\u201d, adding a copy of the contract.\n\nCommenting after the statement on Monday, Nongbri said: \u201cThe sale of the manuscripts and the attempt to cover it up by removing records is almost unbelievable. But the first thing to note are the words \u2018so far\u2019. We don\u2019t yet know the full extent of this. More items may well have been sold to Hobby Lobby.\u201d\n\nThe Green family and Steve Green have been embroiled in multiple scandals over the long-running programme of purchasing biblical fragments for the Museum of the Bible. According to the Egypt Exploration Society, its investigations have revealed that 13 pieces in the museum\u2019s collection are in fact the rightful property of the nonprofit society.\n\nIn a statement, the Museum of the Bible said the antiquities were \u201csold illegally\u201d by a \u201cknown expert\u201d, adding that of the 13 items identified, only four were the property of the museum, with the remainder belonging to Hobby Lobby as part of the Green collection.\n\nThe Green family has assembled what it describes as one of the largest collections of biblical antiquities in the world, many of which are on display in the Museum of the Bible.\n\nHowever, the Greens and the museum have been dogged by controversy over the provenance of some of its acquisitions. In June 2017, Hobby Lobby Stores was ordered to pay a $3m fine for illegally importing thousands of ancient Iraqi artefacts that were falsely labelled and shipped to the company through the United Arab Emirates and Israel.\n\nCommenting after that case Hobby Lobby said it \u201cdid not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process\u201d and relied on dealers who did not understand how to properly ship the items.\n\nIn a second high-profile controversy, the Green family and the Museum of the Bible were forced to remove five document fragments \u2013 described as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 when they were identified as modern forgeries after reporting by the Guardian and other media organisations.", "description": "Dirk Obbink allegedly sold artefacts to US chain Hobby Lobby without permission", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont", "Stephanie Merritt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f578aaef55d9adb75bc8d9d18d48f2a6f96556e/0_67_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ebf1d6688c91388a60213597860432f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
