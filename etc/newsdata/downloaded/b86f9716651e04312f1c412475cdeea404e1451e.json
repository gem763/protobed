And if a mass boycott ever did happen, it wouldn\u2019t be triggered by a dispute in a foreign country on the other side of the world.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cwe\u2019ll make this happen!\u201d rallying cry. This is an argument that it should happen. If the only moral language these venal scumbags understand is money, then the obvious thing to do is send them a message in that language.\n\nScout\u2019s honor: I was going to buy a league pass to watch the games this year because of Zion and Ja Morant and to follow the new-look Lakers and Clippers. After this, not one dime. Philip Klein gets to the heart of my disgust. It\u2019s not just the kowtowing to China that\u2019s repulsive, it\u2019s the cumulative hypocrisy of one \u201cwoke\u201d American industry after another congratulating themselves for their progressive activism here at home while lapping up Chinese blood money. Mass internment of Chinese Muslims, organ harvesting, religious oppression, an ever more intrusive surveillance state, and no one says a word \u2014 until finally Hong Kongers stand up for their rights and the NBA\u2019s moral degenerates rush to take sides with the oppressor.\n\nF*** these people, one and all. Sometimes that\u2019s all you can say. Although Klein said a bit more:\n\nIn fact, the NBA has prided itself of having an open policy on political activism. Commissioner Adam Silver has said he sees his job as protecting player\u2019s free speech. When President Trump said he wouldn\u2019t invite the 2018 NBA champion to the White House, Silver boasted of the long tradition of activism in the NBA. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that in this league our players, our coaches, our owners, feel comfortable expressing their political points of view,\u201d he said. Of course, it\u2019s easy for the NBA to be all sanctimonious about speech when it means a star player calling an unpopular American president a \u201cbum.\u201d But when it comes to a GM having the temerity to tweet \u201cFight for Freedom,\u201d suddenly Silver cowers, and a U.S. sports league has to impose totalitarian China\u2019s censorship rules on one of its executives. Since, clearly the NBA only values money, above all else, if you care about freedom and are inscenced by this decision, then there is only one way to send a message to them \u2014 by denying them any of yours.\n\nWhen I say \u201cone and all,\u201d I mean one and all. We\u2019re a day into this and not one person associated with the NBA has expressed any shame or reluctance. Even Rockets GM Daryl Morey, whose \u201cFight for Freedom\u201d tweet about Hong Kong ignited the dispute, had to issue a hostage statement to appease his boss, the league, and their Chinese communist masters. The single sleaziest statement thus far has come from new Nets owner Joe Tsai, who seized on the occasion to lecture Americans about not interfering with a totalitarian regime when it\u2019s trying to tamp down an insurrection in the name of human rights. Mind you, Hong Kong protesters are known to carry the American flag to signal the values their movement stands for. This filth sums up what the American-born and bred NBA thinks of them:\n\nWhat is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues. The problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities. Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China. The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.\n\nHow much ruthlessness by authoritarian superpowers towards resistance-minded provinces and neighbors has been justified in the name of fighting \u201cseparatism\u201d in the past century? Tsai\u2019s statement is studiously morally neutral between the two sides, framing it in terms of \u201csovereignty\u201d and a tedious run-through of modern Chinese history to justify a crackdown on Hong Kong. \u201cI am going into all of this because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories,\u201d he whimpers. Not to go full Godwin but national trauma about the injustices of World War I was used to excuse all manner of German aggression in the quarter-century afterward as well. Even more so than the hypocrisy, the attempt by Tsai and others to defend China\u2019s stance towards Hong Kong on the merits is egregious and unnecessary. I\u2019d much rather they say that they frankly don\u2019t care if every last Hong Konger is skinned alive if it\u2019ll make the NBA an extra buck than to let themselves be coopted into Chinese propaganda efforts to paint the Hong Kong protest movement as illegitimate. Admit your venality and moral bankruptcy forthrightly. At least there\u2019s a shred of dignity in that.\n\nJust to make this a bit sleazier, the NBA is talking out of both sides of its mouth, feigning \u201cneutrality\u201d with American fans while siding openly with Beijing for China\u2019s domestic consumption:\n\nIt gets worse for @nba. Per @FinancialTimes they provided statements that were translated differently in Chinese and English. Talk about duplicitous. Just pathetic. pic.twitter.com/H242uecC5H \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nWith any luck, this will end up a debacle for the NBA on both ends. Tencent, the network that carries NBA games in China, has already blacklisted the Houston Rockets from its coverage. If a meaningful portion of American fans tune out too, the league will understand that it has to choose between the two countries\u2019 values. Which it does, and which other American industries will doubtless come to learn too as U.S. relations with China turn chillier. Bad enough to turn a blind eye to Chinese abuses for a buck, but it\u2019s intolerable to force Americans like Morey to toe the Chinese state party line on moral matters as basic as whether Hong Kongers should have basic due process rights. If that\u2019s how the NBA wants it, let them move to China. Let Zion suit up for the Shanghai Pelicans.\n\nAs a goodwill gesture, maybe the Rockets could offer to play an exhibition game for prisoners at a Chinese concentration camp. Exit question via Alex Griswold: How could anyone ever again take NBA social-justice activism seriously after this? They\u2019re utter frauds.\n\nUpdate: As fate would have it, \u201cSouth Park\u201d tackled the topic of Chinese censorship of American business in a new episode that aired just five days ago. That episode is now banned in the Chinese market.
