Furious staff have pointed out that the complaints unit is dominated by older white men who may not understand the true impact of Trump\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cEvery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism,\u201d Munchetty told viewers in July, during a discussion with her co-host Dan Walker. She went on to add that she was \u201cabsolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that\u201d.\n\nSangita Myska, a BBC correspondent, said \u201cthere is a lot of bewilderment among BAME staff\u201d about the decision, while the former China editor Carrie Gracie has said the ruling was perplexing given \u201ctelling the truth and celebrating diversity\u201d is a core BBC value and \u201cwe speak out when something is not right\u201d.\n\nThe Newsnight correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse said: \u201cI propose a little thought experiment: if a BBC presenter suggested on air that a black Brit should \u2018go back to where they came from\u2019 and viewers complained the remark was racist, would the BBC uphold such a complaint? One would hope so.\u201d\n\nThey were joined by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who said the BBC would have to explain this \u201castonishing decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cNaga Munchetty stated a fact. She shared experiences of racism she\u2019s suffered. That can\u2019t be at odds with any editorial guidelines,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decision to reprimand Munchetty, which followed a single complaint from a member of the public, was made by the BBC\u2019s executive complaints unit, a committee that rules on contentious issues. The membership of the group is not public but internal BBC documents suggest it is a seven-strong group featuring only two women.\n\nA number of BBC presenters and journalists have said they are considering writing to the director general, Tony Hall, to ask for the decision to be reviewed before it causes further damage to the corporation\u2019s public standing, especially among BAME communities. There is particular anger about the ruling given Munchetty\u2019s comments were made in response to questions from Walker, who was asking for her personal experience of racist language.\n\nOther staff privately expressed exasperation that the BBC has allowed a single complaint from a member of the public to blow up into another damaging row for the corporation. The clip of Munchetty\u2019s short exchange with Walker briefly went viral in the summer, earning hundreds of thousands of views and remains on BBC Breakfast social media accounts, but had largely been forgotten until the recent ruling.\n\nIn an updated statement the BBC said Trump\u2019s comments were widely condemned as racist and that Munchetty was perfectly entitled to give her personal response to the president\u2019s words. However, she was found to have breached editorial guidelines because BBC journalists are not allowed to \u201cgive their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so\u201d.\n\nSenior journalists privately complain that news executives are struggling with how to handle persistent complaints from rightwing campaigners about the corporation\u2019s perceived leftwing biases, creating the internal perception that bosses are overcompensating following the 2016 Brexit referendum amid an ongoing culture war.\n\nAt the same time the BBC management is increasingly facing internal clashes with its own journalists who are publicly calling out the corporation when they feel it is falling short on issues relating to diversity \u2013 both internally and on-screen. This then causes clashes over which topics are legitimate topics of discussion for the corporation\u2019s television and radio shows and which are not up for debate.\n\nEarlier this year, the BBC reminded staff not to tweet their personal views, after employees publicly objected to BBC programmes hosting discussions that debated the rights and wrongs of teaching children about tolerance for LGBT people.\n\nMunchetty did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Complaints unit ruling against Naga Munchetty comes amid concerns broadcaster falls short on diversity issues", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d534346621db32487b717f69cc765691e7efa335/0_205_4124_2475/master/4124.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c5eba98692e7cb3b9c8a207b213ce76", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
