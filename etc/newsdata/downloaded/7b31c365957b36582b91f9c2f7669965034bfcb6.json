Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nThere\u2019s something about Freestyle Love Supreme \u2014 the hip-hop comedy group created by performer Anthony Veneziale, director Thomas Kail, and a group of high profile buddies, including Lin-Manuel Miranda \u2014 that takes you straight back to college. Especially if you went somewhere, like I did, where your fellow students tried to convince you that singing without instruments or being hilarious without a script were your only marketable skills. (The bright-eyed people seeking donations on New York street corners give me the same jolt of terror I used to get when some senior would stop me on the quad with, \u201cHi! Do you sing?\u201d) Veneziale and Kail were undergrads together, and their upbeat rap-meets-improv project retains that youthful peppiness. Now on Broadway for a limited run, they\u2019re even doing two shows on certain nights. Not that things are gonna get crazy \u2014 fls, as the show abbreviates itself, is a swift, wholesome affair, and even the 10 p.m. curtain on Mondays and weekends will get you out before 11:30.\n\nIn college, I always found my critical impulse significantly dialed down at an improv show. Turns out that hasn\u2019t really changed. What a group like Freestyle Love Supreme does isn\u2019t theater (that\u2019s not a dig, just a description), though it is a totally invested kind of performance. It changes so much from show to show, audience to audience, and relies so entirely on the in-the-moment agility and charisma of its performers, that intense critique just doesn\u2019t feel right. I always found myself wanting to laugh at college improv, and giving it a big old heaping helping of benefit of the doubt, even when it wasn\u2019t all that funny \u2014 because it\u2019s terrifying up there, y\u2019all! Jokes are hard enough when they\u2019re written in advance. Freestyle Love Supreme, like the quick-spitting rap style in its name and the improv comedy form it\u2019s built around, is held together by nerve and verve, good instincts and a lot of good will. You may hit it on an on-fire night or a night of mostly mild chuckles, but it\u2019s still a formidable performance feat. It\u2019s high-energy, very sweet-natured fun.\n\nThe show\u2019s content is a nightly surprise for both audience and performers, though the structure is fixed. Like many an ancient improv ancestor, the fls performers spin their material out of audience suggestions, warming themselves up with some relatively simple requests (\u201cGive us some verbs!\u201d Veneziale, who goes by the rap moniker Two-Touch, entreats the crowd early on. \u201cYou know, action words. Like impeach.\u201d) and building all the way up to the creation of a \u201crap musical\u201d based on one enthusiastic audience member\u2019s day. There are a couple of strange scenarios in life when people are thrilled to be made fun of in public, and having your day musicalized at an improv show is one of them. Angelica, from my audience \u2014 names have been changed to protect the exuberant \u2014 was thrilled to see her flight from Orlando to Newark, her relationship with her husband (who stayed home with their cat), and her probably-not-actually-a-flirtation with a theater-district bartender all gently mocked, in rhyme, by the fls crew.\n\nThat crew is a rotating roster of big talents, along with a special, unannounced guest at every performance. Along with Veneziale \u2014 the production\u2019s smooth, playful emcee \u2014 I saw Utkarsh Ambudkar, who\u2019s witty, sly, and hella quick; Chris Sullivan, a mightily impressive beatboxer; Arthur Lewis, who\u2019s soft-spoken, straight-faced, and mostly rocks one of the keyboards, along with Ian Weinberger; the very, very funny Aneesa Folds; and Hamilton\u2019s original George Washington, Christopher Jackson. \u201cThat\u2019s my president,\u201d said Ambudkar, to huge cheers.\n\nThough the show builds toward a couple of long-form scenarios, I often found myself more truly amused by the fls crew\u2019s simpler bits. A faux-aggressive rap based on things the audience loathes (which, despite the \u201cimpeach\u201d joke, stayed notably clear of politics) reminded me, delightfully, of the Lonely Island\u2019s \u201cI Threw It on the Ground.\u201d Out of a list of shouted options that included college loans, the MTA, lactose intolerance, and \u201cmy twin brother,\u201d Folds took on \u201craisins,\u201d hilariously recounting (or fabricating, whatever) the experience of finding them in the stuffing at a Thanksgiving shindig hosted by her \u201cwhite friend \u2026 her name is Carrie.\u201d The horror! Why are white people always putting raisins in shit? NOOOO. Though they didn\u2019t drop the beat, Folds\u2019s fellow freestylers cracked up right along with the audience \u2014 and that\u2019s probably the biggest charm of Freestyle Love Supreme. It\u2019s like \u2014 no, it just is \u2014 watching a talented, generous group of close friends having a damn good time. More power to them.\n\nFreestyle Love Supreme is at the Booth Theatre through January 5, 2020.", "description": "Theater Review: Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Freestyle Love Supreme at the Booth Theatre on Broadway in 2019", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-freestyle-love-supreme.w1200.h630.jpg"}
