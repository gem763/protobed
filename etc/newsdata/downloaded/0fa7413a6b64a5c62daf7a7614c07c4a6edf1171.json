If Democrats flip both chambers, they would have full control of state government for the first time in a generation.\n\nDemocrats are banking on anti-Trump sentiment to help them in suburban districts. Many Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to avoid talking about the president or divisive issues such as guns and abortion.\n\nAD\n\nNot Chase.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be quiet. I won\u2019t be silenced,\u201d she declared to about 40 donors at the country club. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to boldly represent our family values and those values which make Virginia, Virginia. We are not California. We are not New York. And we will not be, as long as I\u2019m serving in the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChase rails against the push by congressional Democrats toward impeachment, calling it \u201cjust another failed and desperate attempt to take Trump out of office.\u201d\n\nVirginia\u2019s \u2018off-off-year\u2019 elections were once sleepy. And then came Trump.\n\nThe 49-year-old freshman says Democrats and RINOs \u2014 Republicans in name only \u2014 are aligned against her because she is a conservative truth-teller.\n\nThe fracas with the Capitol Police officer over the parking spot was a \u201ctrap,\u201d she said. The police report saying she called the Senate clerk Miss Piggy, a partisan hit. The Facebook ad that had her vowing to \u201cshoot down\u201d anti-gun groups, bungled by her ad agency or perhaps altered by a Democratic saboteur.\n\nAD\n\nVa. senator says she never approved ad vowing to \u2018shoot down\u2019 anti-gun groups\n\nAt a time when the GOP can\u2019t afford to lose a single seat, some Senate Republicans fret that the drama swirling around \u201cSenator Annie Oakley Chase,\u201d as some call her, threatens to put her reliably red district in play.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat she does, we all pay a price for,\u201d said one frustrated GOP senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nChesterfield County Sheriff Karl Leonard, a Republican who withdrew his support this spring because Chase would not apologize to the police officer, has been in the senator\u2019s sights ever since. She threatened to hurt his fundraising \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll let my Republican donors know,\u201d she texted \u2014 and has been campaigning with his challenger, an independent. On Friday, she accused Leonard of making Chesterfield a \u201csanctuary city.\u201d That was news to the sheriff, who last year backed Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), an immigration hard-liner.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the Chesterfield County GOP ousted Chase for attacking Leonard and promoting the independent challenging him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a train wreck in slow motion,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people trying to get her back on the tracks, but she just doesn\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSenate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), who saddled Chase with the Annie Oakley nickname, said she also reminds him of the president.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a replica of Trump,\u201d Saslaw said. \u201cHis conduct is bizarre, and so is hers.\u201d\n\nChase supporters compare her to Trump, too, but favorably.\n\nThey like her bravado, even if they wince at times. Conservative radio host John Fredericks said Chase \u201cowes everybody an apology\u201d over the confrontation with police, but still admires her willingness to speak frankly on tough issues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe has chutzpah,\u201d said Fredericks, chairman of Trump\u2019s 2016 Virginia campaign. \u201cAgree with her or not, she is who she is.\u201d\n\nDuring a special legislative session in July, a gun-control group wielding a video camera put Republicans on the spot as they passed through the Capitol\u2019s marble hallways. As the video crew lobbed questions about expanding background checks, a pair of suburban Republicans scattered. Chase didn\u2019t run; she said flatly that she wouldn\u2019t support anything that infringes on gun rights.\n\nAD\n\nGun debate ends abruptly in Virginia as GOP-controlled legislature adjourns\n\nAt the country club fundraiser, the singer who struts red carpets in liberal Los Angeles wearing Trump-tribute gowns felt a kinship with the outspoken senator.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like sisters at this point,\u201d Villa said. \u201cI mean, this woman is so fearless. . . . There\u2019s not a lot of people out there who have the guts to do and say what she does and says.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not without risk, even in a district where Trump took 53 percent of the vote while losing Virginia overall by six points. Chase\u2019s Democratic challenger \u2014 another Amanda, Amanda Pohl \u2014 has used some of Chase\u2019s headlines to raise money.\n\nAfter the El Paso mass shooting in August, Chase put out a video calling for an end to \u201cgun-free zones that are creating safe havens for criminals who don\u2019t follow the law.\u201d\n\nPohl, a social worker and former hospital chaplain who favors expanded background checks, promoted the video, too \u2014 calling Chase\u2019s response \u201coutrageous and dangerous. She is out of touch with our district and with reality.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPohl has outraised Chase so far this year, $252,000 to $189,000, and had more cash on hand heading into September.\n\nThreats and theatrics\n\nEmotions were high last year as a handful of Senate Republicans were about to break ranks and vote to expand Medicaid \u2014 something the GOP had fiercely opposed for years. House Republicans had done an about-face after an anti-Trump wave in 2017 all but wiped out their 2-to-1 majority. Now Senate Republicans were crumbling.\n\nIn a closed caucus meeting ahead of the vote, Chase warned the four defectors that she would see to it that they all got primary challengers, according to witnesses.\n\nThen she stormed out of the meeting room in the historic Capitol, grabbing the doorknob with such force that it went airborne, barely missing a senator seated nearby.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m just a politically incorrect redneck from Chesterfield that is tired of all the BS going on in Richmond,\u201d she wrote in a text message confirming the event. \u201cI\u2019m a strong voice for the people back home who sent me to the GA to clean things up. I truly believe my constituents back home would have cheered me on had they been there. My district has had enough of politicians who promise one thing and break their promises when the pressure is on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChase ended that message with a smiley face. Despite her hard-charging ways, she\u2019s often upbeat.\n\nYet for all her bravado and breezy air, Chase often expresses fear for her physical safety. She said she has received death threats because of her outspokenness. She has hired a bodyguard who doubles as her campaign manager.\n\nChase\u2019s remark about rape came in a Facebook exchange with someone who suggested that the senator was \u201cparanoid\u201d for carrying a gun when she goes jogging on secluded park trails.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s those who are naive and unprepared that end [up] raped,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSorry. But I\u2019m not going to be a statistic.\u201d\n\nShe said she started wearing the gun on her hip after immigration activists confronted her and another senator about a bill to ban sanctuary cities. She said she had Capitol Police drive her short distances \u2014 using officers like a ride-hailing service, critics said \u2014 because she was worried about walking alone.\n\nAD\n\nShe prefers to park in a secured pedestrian plaza right outside her office on Capitol Square, saying that\u2019s safer than her assigned garage a block away. That\u2019s what she told Officer Ashley Berryman in March, when she rolled up to the plaza gate in her white Lexus. Berryman told Chase she was not allowed to park there without special permission.\n\n\u201cI suggested that she park in her assigned deck,\u201d Berryman wrote later in an incident report first reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \u201cShe stated that she will not park in the deck because she is in fear of her life, and that there is no guard there and that she had been receiving threats. . . . She stated \u2018I\u2019m not going to move unless you let the [expletive] barricades down to let me in.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSchool buses trying to drop off children for a field trip were stuck behind Chase while the episode played out. Fuming over the Senate clerk\u2019s prime parking spot, the report said, Chase referred to the clerk as Miss Piggy.\n\n\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d she demanded, according to Berryman.\n\nSupporters of Chase\u2019s Democratic opponent seized on that line, plastering it on T-shirts: \u201c \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019 \u2014 Senator Amanda Chase. Yes, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for Amanda Pohl.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Capitol Police, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City) apologized on behalf of the Republican caucus, saying its members \u201cshare your exasperation.\u201d\n\nThere was no apology from Chase, who wrote on Facebook that the officer\u2019s report looked like it had been penned by \u201ca democrat operative.\u201d\n\nShe initially denied using profanity, but later told WRVA\u2019s John Reid: \u201cI did drop the f-bomb, but it was not directed at her [the officer]. It was at the gate.\u201d She told The Washington Post she has \u201cno recollection\u201d of calling the clerk Miss Piggy.\n\nWhen Chase first dipped her toe into politics years ago, she aimed only to disrupt a suburban road project. Chesterfield County wanted to extend a dead-end street near the neighborhood pool where Chase, a home-schooling mother of four, was swim team coach.\n\n\u201cI was concerned about the safety and well-being of the kids on my swim team because I had probably 150 to 200 of them that would ride their bikes to the pool,\u201d said Chase, who owns a small financial services firm. She rallied team parents and persuaded the county to scrap the project.\n\n\u201cFrom then on I just started volunteering on different campaigns,\u201d Chase said. \u201cI just got to be known as the grass-roots girl from Chesterfield and everybody would call me.\u201d The volunteer stints turned into paid work for then-Rep. Eric Cantor (R) and later, the outsider who toppled him, Brat.\n\nChase got into the ring herself four years ago, as a tea party upstart challenging state Sen. Steve Martin for the GOP nomination. He\u2019d been in the legislature 28 years and Chase said it was time for a change. She beat him, despite being outspent $630,000 to $76,000.\n\nOn the campaign trail today, Chase talks about how she bucked both parties to pull off two of her biggest wins: a coal ash cleanup law and a deal that greatly boosted public access to legislative business. She accomplished the latter by teaming up with a liberal Democrat, Del. Mark H. Levine (Alexandria), to form the Transparency Caucus. They successfully pushed to get committee meetings \u2014 where most of the work of the legislature gets done \u2014 live-streamed and archived.\n\n\u201cAmanda Chase, to her credit, is an independent person,\u201d said Levine, who supports Pohl in the race. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t have that many independent voices. I\u2019m sure that causes the Republican leadership some heartburn.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Virginia Republicans fear that Amanda F.
