How about dumb, caveman Astros", "language": "en", "text": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nHouston has been lauded for its acumen in analytics, its ability to gather and dissect data in determining the best moves \u2014 on and off the field. The Astros\u2019 new-school approach, once revolutionary, is now commonplace in major-league front offices, largely run by Ivy League grads with degrees in business and finance.\n\nBut for all of the organization\u2019s smarts in crunching numbers, poring over video, and analyzing trends, Houston proved fairly dumb this week in handling human relations and crisis communications.\n\nAn incident that could\u2019ve blown over with an upfront admission of guilt and sincere apology, instead became an unwelcome storyline and World Series distraction. Major League Baseball has launched an investigation and disciplinary action is expected by week\u2019s end.\n\nThe Astros have no one to blame but assistant general manager Brandon Taubman and themselves, respectively, for committing the original offense and attempting a cover-up.\n\nIn case you missed it, Sports Illustrated published an article Monday night that detailed an outburst directed at three female reporters in Houston\u2019s clubhouse Saturday night, after Houston won the American League pennant. \u201cThank God we got Osuna!\u201d Taubman yelled repeatedly. \u201cI\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\u201d\n\nTaubman was referring to Astros closer Roberto Osuna, who served a 75-game suspension for allegedly assaulting the mother of his three-year-old child in May 2018. Among the three reporters Taubman screamed at, the presumed primary target was a woman who has tweeted frequently about domestic violence in recent years. She was wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet.\n\nSI reporter Stephanie Apstein was among the trio enduring Taubman\u2019s conniptions. She asked the Astros to make him available, and/or provide a comment from the organization, and they declined \u2026 until the story was published.\n\nThat\u2019s when they tried whitewashing, claiming in a statement that the story is \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time.\n\n\u201cHis comments had everything to do about the game situation \u2026 they were also were not directed toward any specific reporters. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nThe prevarication might\u2019ve worked, too, except multiple outlets responded by confirming SI\u2019s account. According to the Houston Chronicle, citing witnesses, \u201cthe three female reporters were approximately eight feet away and one was visibly shaken by the comment. There were no players in the area and no interviews were being conducted at the time.\u201d\n\nCaught in a falsehood, the Astros went to Plan B. Taubman released a weak apology, claiming that his \u201coverexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted.\u201d Owner Jim Crane released a statement claiming the Astros are \u201ccommitted to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nWhatever.\n\nI\u2019m not here to debate whether teams should sign alleged/convicted abusers, or whether suspensions issued to alleged/convicted abusers are too short. There\u2019s plenty of time for those arguments, and the next case could arrive at any moment. The fact is Houston acquired Osuna from Toronto, via trade in July 2018, and he led the AL with 38 saves this season.\n\nIt\u2019s fine if Taubman supports Osuna and believes he deserves the lifeline Houston offered.\n\nBut to aggressively and profanely state that position, unprovoked, essentially berating female reporters who might (or might not) feel otherwise, is highly offensive. Even worse is the Astros\u2019 attempt to discredit the reporter who brought Taubman\u2019s abhorrent conduct to light.\n\nApstein wrote that the incident was so frightening and unsettling, another Houston staffer apologized for Taubman\u2019s behavior. But that\u2019s not enough.\n\nThe Astros need to issue a public apology for claiming her story was a fabrication. Maybe that\u2019s what Taubman told his bosses, but they should\u2019ve done their own investigation. Other reporters and observers witnessed the incident and weren\u2019t hard to find.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed for a lot of reasons,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said when asked for his reaction Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s uncalled for. For me as a leader in this organization down here in the clubhouse, on the field, I take everything that happens in the clubhouse to heart.\n\n\u201cNo one, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media, should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need an MBA to realize that Taubman\u2019s outburst was insufferable and Houston\u2019s response has been reprehensible.\n\nThe Astros might be smarter than most organizations. But they\u2019ve been idiots on this matter.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
