It\u2019s just not real. Molly has all her injections, she had everything when she was a baby.\n\nShe had been away with her auntie, uncle and friends (Picture: North News / NNP)\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know anything for definite about why she died. We haven\u2019t had the coroner in, she\u2019s still abroad. I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. She shouldn\u2019t be by herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Molly was an angel. She was funny, gorgeous, witty. She was the life of the party [and] so well loved. She was brilliant.\u2019\n\nAccording to the NHS website, two does of the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella, both given to children before the age of four, provides 95 per cent immunity against the infection.\n\nMolly\u2019s family say she was also treated for tonsillitis two weeks before she went on holiday, which may have made her vulnerable to falling ill.\n\nDominique Bower, 34, Molly\u2019s aunt, said the teenager had started throwing up on Wednesday at a water-park they attended together.\n\nMolly\u2019s family say she was vaccinated as a baby (Picture: Facebook)\n\nBy Friday morning she was delirious and an on-site doctor examined her around her neck and indicated to the family it was mumps.\n\nMolly was struggling to breathe, but after taking painkillers she fell asleep, with her friend Niamh taking care of her while the others went to the pool.\n\nKind barber gives 7-year-old boy with autism haircut outside to make him feel comfortable\n\nDominique said: \u2018We came back up to her room and she had been sick all over herself. We put her in the bath and washed her hair.\n\n\u2018Then we wrapped her in a towel and [her uncle] Dylan scooped her up like a baby. Her friend was combing her hair and then all I heard was screaming.\n\n\u2018Her eyes had rolled back. From 5:25pm right on, the paramedics and doctors worked on her for over two hours.\n\nThe doctors diagnosed her with mumps (Picture: North News / NNP)\n\n\u2018I looked at Molly like a daughter. She was a beautiful niece, I just wish I could bring her back. She\u2019ll always have a place in our heart.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family landed back in the UK on Monday October 14, but Molly\u2019s body is still in a mortuary in Inca, Majorca.\n\nFamily can't sell home after nearby slaughterhouse flooded it with blood and entrails\n\nA GoFundMe page has now raised more than \u00a39,700 to bring the teen home to be buried in Sherburn Hill, County Durham.\n\nBut Molly\u2019s grandmother Tracey Lawson, 59, said the family are desperate for answers.\n\nShe said: \u2018At the moment there\u2019s not a lot to say because she\u2019s not here. Why did she die? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to ask.\n\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t that doctor send her to the hospital? We have a lot of questions and no answers.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
