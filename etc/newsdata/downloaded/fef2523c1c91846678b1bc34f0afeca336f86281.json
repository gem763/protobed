The reports are a sampling of analysts\u2019 thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron\u2019s. Some of the reports\u2019 issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed.\n\nNetflixNFLX-Nasdaq\n\nOutperformPrice $294.34 on Sept. 9\n\nby Credit Suisse\n\nOur tracking of app downloads data through the first seven weeks of the third quarter suggests a broad-based rebound in global Netflix trends, reversing its mysteriously poor second-quarter performance. A more marketable content slate appears to be contributing, based on the timing of download improvements in certain countries, including Saudi Arabia cracking the top 10. It is unclear if India\u2019s addition of a mobile tier of service is enhancing a rebound there, but international ex-India is similarly improved.\n\nOur updated content tracker shows many more original-content releases in the third quarter, in particular for international series and Hollywood dramas; several key titles are left (including Ryan Murphy\u2019s first show). We have materially higher content spending year over year for the fourth quarter, notably for The Crown S3, The Witcher, The Irishman, and 6 Underground.\n\nNetflix\u2019s original slate dwarfs the new entrants. We have tracked 48 titles in development at Disney+ (launching Nov. 12), 43 at Apple \u2019s TV+, and 23 at HBO Max (launching in spring 2020), versus Netflix\u2019s 71 English-language dramas, 62 non-English series, 32 comedies, and 108 films in development (not including unscripted shows, documentaries, and animated features). Netflix trades at 15 times our estimated 2023 price/earnings ratio; our $440 target is unchanged.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill CMG-NYSE\n\nOutperformPrice $836.32 on Sept. 9\n\nby Wedbush\n\nAs the industry transitions toward a larger mix of digital transactions, we believe that Chipotle is in a leading position to establish a digital moat. We not only continue to see near-term momentum as management executes toward this transition, but also we believe that CMG is poised to sustain outsize same-store sales and earnings-per-share growth in the medium to long term in an industry where\u2026growth is likely to command an increasing premium. Therefore, we upgrade to Outperform from Neutral.\n\nWe believe that digital sales at CMG are on a path toward a 30%+ sales mix exiting 2021. On the third-party marketplace front, we expect CMG to adopt incremental partners, given their varying regional market-share dynamics, adding additional layers of comp. Meanwhile, we expect the promotional collaboration between CMG and existing partnerships to continue to drive increased transactions. With respect to Chipotle\u2019s own app, aside from a favorable promotional cadence, we expect loyalty to act as the primary lever behind both adoption and usage, positioning CMG at the top of restaurant apps likely to find space on customers\u2019 handheld devices\n\nWe are increasing our 2019 EPS estimate to $13.78 from $13.34. We are also increasing our 2020 EPS estimate to $18.32 from $17.96, and our 2021 EPS estimate to $23.19 from $22.49. We are increasing our price target to $980 from $780. Our price target represents a 52 times multiple on our higher 2020 EPS estimate, net of cash.\n\nTD Ameritrade AMTD-Nasdaq\n\nBuy Price on Sept. 11 $48.59\n\nby Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners\n\nTrading in August was above our expectations, as daily average revenue trades came in at 898,000 (+12% month over month, +15% year over year). We are raising our fiscal-2019 EPS estimate by two cents a share, to $4.04, while maintaining our fiscal 2020 estimate, also $4.04. Our price target of $60 is based on about a 15 times multiple of our fiscal-2020 estimate, which is at a modest discount to TD Ameritrade\u2019s historical average P/E multiple, due to multiple contraction across the peer group because of the interest rate outlook for 2019 and 2020.\n\nVarian Medical Systems VAR-NYSE\n\nOutperform Price $115.19 on Sept. 11\n\nby Baird Equity Research\n\nVarian announced this afternoon that China has granted a tariff exclusion request for medical linear accelerators, reversing a tariff policy that has been in effect since Aug. 23, 2018. The tariffs impacted those systems manufactured by Varian at its Palo Alto facility (i.e., all systems other than Halcyon, which is manufactured in China).\n\nWe estimate that management\u2019s most recent guidance update implied about a $55 million to $60 million gross tariff impact to fiscal-2019 earnings before interest and taxes, before accounting for any mitigation benefits. Management had quantified the revenue and Ebit impact from the China tariffs at $48 million at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Back-of-the-envelope math on our part suggests that the original $48 million Ebit headwind estimate from the August 2018 China retaliatory tariffs amounts to upward of about 40 cents in EPS.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement is a nice win for Varian and should imply upside to current Street estimates for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, and it gives management meaningful operating/budgeting flexibility for next year. Price target: $158. We would be buyers in the near term to the low/mid $150s.\n\nTo be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com.", "description": "Also, analysts\u2019 views on Chipotle, TD Ameritrade, and Varian Medical", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-83899/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
