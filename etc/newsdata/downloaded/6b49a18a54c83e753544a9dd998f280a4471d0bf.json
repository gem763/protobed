Kinzinger: Trump \u2018Justified\u2019 in Not Notifying Congress About al-Baghdadi Raid \u2014 Not a \u2018Scandal\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) on Monday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Fox News Channel defended President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to not notify Congress about the raid that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nKinzinger said he thinks Trump should have notified Congress, but said he was \u201ctotally justified\u201d in not notifying Congress about the planned raid, adding there is no \u201cscandal\u201d despite some Democratic leadership\u2019s complaints.\n\n\u201cLook, I think [Trump] should\u2019ve [notified Congress], but I\u2019m not really concerned about it and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big scandal,\u201d Kinzinger advised. \u201cThink about at it this way, this in a legal perspective is no different than every raid that occurs in Syria and Iraq. And, frankly, if the president came in, told Congress about every time special operations forces were doing anything, we wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything else done.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo, I think the president was totally justified in not alerting Congress, but maybe it would\u2019ve been nice if he did it. But for them to make this kind of a scandal when we should be celebrating the death of a really evil man and his introduction into hell. I think that\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d\n\nKinzinger went on to say there is \u201czero practical benefit\u201d to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) knowing about the raid.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) on Monday's broadcast of \"America's Newsroom\" on Fox News Channel defended President Donald Trump's decision to not | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kinzinger-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
