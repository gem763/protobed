But if there\u2019s one thing I could do without, it\u2019s turning the clocks back for daylight savings. For years, I just accepted the fact that it would take days of morning grogginess and evening fatigue until my body caught up with the changing of the clocks.\n\nIf you feel the same about daylight savings, I have some good news. There is a safe, effective, and 100% natural way to keep your internal clock in sync with the clock on the wall. It can replace that ever-present jet-lagged feeling with\u2026feeling perfectly normal!\n\nSo, read on to learn why your body\u2019s clock lags during daylight savings and how this \u201csecret weapon\u201d can help you avoid that jet-lagged feeling.\n\nHow Daylight Savings Affects Your Body\n\nSpring forward and fall back. It\u2019s literally as predictable as clockwork. You see the dates on the calendar months in advance. But even though you know it\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s only a difference of one hour, for some reason your body (and mine too) can\u2019t seem to transition from the night before daylight savings to the morning after it without feeling a little off.\n\nAt first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense. Gaining an hour of sleep in the fall and losing an hour of sleep in the spring shouldn\u2019t feel like life-changing events. I\u2019ve had plenty of nights where I didn\u2019t get enough sleep but I rebounded back after sleeping well the following night\u2013or with a strong cup of coffee the next morning!\n\nBut daylight savings is more than just losing and gaining an hour of sleep. During fall daylight savings, the sun sets before dinner and rises before breakfast. As a result, it\u2019s common to feel tired earlier than usual in the evening. During spring daylight savings, the sun sets considerably later and rises a little later than you are used to. As a result, it\u2019s common to go to bed later.\n\nThe amount of light in the sky plays a significant role in your body\u2019s ability to sleep. When the sky darkens, your body releases a hormone called melatonin, which helps you fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. Before dawn, your body stops releasing melatonin so that you can wake up without feeling groggy.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens on most days and nights, but daylight savings disrupts this process. The changing of the clocks changes the primary external cue that our body relies on to help fall asleep and wake up. But your body\u2019s circadian rhythm\u2013its internal schedule\u2013doesn\u2019t immediately adjust.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nThis explains the grogginess that you feel after daylight savings. But it doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept that groggy feeling for a week or so a couple times per year.\n\nGet Your Rhythm Back\n\nYou can\u2019t change the fact that daylight savings disrupts your body\u2019s release of melatonin. But you can help your body produce more of it.\n\nAs I said earlier, darkening skies induce the release of melatonin. Exposure to light does the opposite. That includes the many sources of artificial lights in your home\u2013lamps, TVs, smartphones, tablets, and more. Turning those lights down or off in the evening\u2013especially in your bedroom\u2013can boost your body\u2019s melatonin production, thus helping your body feel more at rest when it\u2019s time to sleep.\n\nThese tips are effective during most nights of the year, but they aren\u2019t as effective after daylight savings because your body\u2019s clock is still an hour off. So that\u2019s why I recommend that you take a melatonin supplement. Unlike sleeping pills, which contain a cocktail of unnatural substances, melatonin is perfectly natural.\n\nStart by taking 1 mg of melatonin about 30-60 minutes before your preferred bedtime. If 1 mg doesn\u2019t work for you after a day or two, you can gradually increase your dosage up to 3 mg.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for A Better Night\u2019s Sleep\n\nIn addition to melatonin, there are a handful of other ways to get more and better sleep 365 days a year, not just the days after daylight savings. Here are some Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts that I recommend:\n\nDo exercise regularly, if not daily . Exercise is the healthiest thing you can do for your body, hands down. Its benefits are countless, but one of its biggest is helping you fall asleep and stay asleep. You don\u2019t have to run marathons. Even a walk around the block after dinner is better than nothing.\n\n. Exercise is the healthiest thing you can do for your body, hands down.

Do consider adding magnesium to your diet . Magnesium is an essential mineral that the human body cannot make on its own. Magnesium plays a prominent role in several essential bodily functions, including sleep. Healthy levels of magnesium can lead to deeper, more restful sleep because magnesium regulates GABA, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Magnesium can be found in dark leafy greens, seeds and nuts, unprocessed whole grains, legumes, squash, and broccoli.\n\n.

I admit that I lie in bed thinking about all the things I have to do tomorrow. But when you clean your mind of those thoughts before climbing into bed, you are more able to be in a peaceful, restful state of mind.\n\n.

For obvious reasons! Caffeine has a half-life of up to 6 hours. That means 6 hours after that cup of coffee, half the caffeine is still surging through your body. Avoid any caffeine after lunch time if possible.\n\nFor obvious reasons! Caffeine has a half-life of up to 6 hours.

Don\u2019t drink alcohol in the two hours before bedtime . Alcohol may make you feel drowsy, but ultimately it disrupts your R.E.M. sleep, which is associated with more awakenings and more restless sleep.\n\n.

Don\u2019t eat a large dinner, especially in the late evening. The more food you eat in one sitting, the longer it takes to digest. And when your body is working hard to digest a big dinner, it\u2019s not able to shut down and sleep as easily. Try to keep your dinner under 500 calories so that it can be more fully digested by the time you call it a night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried everything under the sun and moon but you still don\u2019t get enough sleep, I suggest that you talk to your doctor or a sleep specialist.\n\nSleep Better Every Night of the Year\n\nDaylight savings can really throw off your sleep schedule and affect how you feel for the following week, perhaps even longer. Instead of using sleeping pills, I suggest that you fight back with a handful of natural solutions with no side effects. Melatonin is a safe, easy, and effective way to fall asleep when your internal clock hasn\u2019t yet adjusted to more or less daylight. Healthy eating and daily exercise also play a large role in how frequently you get quality sleep.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
