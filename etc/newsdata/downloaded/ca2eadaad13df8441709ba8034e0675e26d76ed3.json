The 93-year-old Queen herself, who has come to depend on the 67-year-old divorced daughter of a Liverpool crane driver, once noted as the two women gazed into a mirror that 'we could be sisters'.\n\nSuch is their unique relationship that the Queen allowed Miss Kelly to pen a fascinating account of their bond for a book, The Other Side Of The Coin: The Queen, The Dresser And The Wardrobe.\n\nIt is a remarkably candid account of life at the pinnacle of Palace life, while at the same time remaining discreet.\n\nThose expecting below-stairs revelations or Royal Family gossip will be disappointed. But those interested in the Queen's knowledge of the night sky, for example, will be fascinated.\n\nNever before have such intimate pictures of mistress and servant appeared. Pictured: The Queen is all smiles\n\nFour months after joining the Queen's staff in 1994, Miss Kelly found herself gazing up at the stars during a trip to Balmoral Castle. 'I'd always loved star-gazing and I find it a very calming experience,' she writes.\n\nTo her delight, she discovered that her new boss did, too. 'The Queen shared this passion and we looked out of the window into the darkness together. She pointed out the various constellations \u2014 the Plough, Ursa Major and Cassiopeia.'\n\nWhen Angela mentioned she had brought a telescope, the Queen urged her to go outside at midnight for the best view. Fearful that she might set off intruder alarms, she asked if she could borrow a car to drive up Glenshee, a nearby peak.\n\n'The Queen thought I was crazy and was reluctant to let me drive there alone, so she asked one of her duty protections officers to escort me.'\n\nIt was, she says, the first time she had seen the Milky Way and, the following morning, she rushed up to the Queen to say how wonderful the experience had been.\n\nThe photographer was struck by the 'tender connection' between the two women and what she described as 'an almost mother-daughter type of bond'\n\nAngela Kelly had been working as housekeeper to the British ambassador in Berlin when she first met the Queen.\n\nLining up to say farewell to the royal party at the end of their tour, the Queen, who had given her a thank-you present, asked the then 30-year-old Miss Kelly who the next guests would be in the residence.\n\nWhen the housekeeper replied that it was confidential, an incredulous Prince Philip said: 'Surely you can tell Her Majesty The Queen?'\n\nAfter explaining that she had signed the Official Secrets Act, she then offered to return her gifts. 'I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to keep them since I'd refused the information they'd asked for,' she writes.\n\nSecrets of the wardrobe: Angela chooses carefully co-ordinated designs in vibrant hues for the Queen\n\n'The Queen simply told me to keep them.' Thanking her, she said: 'I will remember this for the rest of my life.' And the Queen replied: 'Angela, so will I.'\n\nTrue to her word, the Queen soon offered her a coveted post at the Palace.\n\nSome years into her appointment Miss Kelly moved from being mere dresser to dressmaker. The moment came after the Queen had asked her opinion on some new designs.\n\nShe did not approve, which hardly endeared her to the visiting couturiers. But just at the moment Prince Philip walked past and casually asked: 'Is that the material for the sofa?' Outside the room, Miss Kelly punched the air with delight.\n\nThe Other Side Of The Coin: The Queen, The Dresser And The Wardrobe by Angela Kelly\n\nHer book is a peek at what goes on behind the scenes in royal life before those great State occasions when the Queen is on view.\n\nFor example Miss Kelly has developed a quirky way to prepare the Garter robes that the Queen wears to the annual ceremony at St George's chapel, Windsor.\n\nWell before the big day, she hangs the blue velvet robe in a bathroom and runs a hot bath \u2014 the steam ensures that all the creases fall out.\n\nAnd the robes worn for the State Opening of Parliament are so heavy they are draped over two chairs to take the weight as the Queen is helped into them.\n\nAfter a flurry of insider bets on the colour of the Queen's hats at Royal Ascot a few years ago, Miss Kelly came up with a scheme to stop the cheating. Now, every day during the royal meeting, she lays out a line of different coloured hats for everyone in the royal quarters to see so not even the Queen's servants know which hat will be worn.\n\nOver the years, Angela has revolutionised the Queen's wardrobe with vibrant colours and more modern designs. Along the way it has led to an unbreakable friendship between two very different women, one brought up in a palace and the other one of six children raised in a two-up, two-down in the back streets of Liverpool.\n\nAngela is still as discreet in this book as that day when the unlikely duo first met in the Berlin. After all, just imagine the kind of book she could have written . . .", "description": "They give us a glimpse of the Queen we rarely, if ever, see.
