I would like to help prevent vulnerable young people from falling victim to such a crime,\" the woman told Kyodo News.\n\nShiraishi had once worked as a recruiter in the sex industry, scouting women on the streets, and he might have become skillful at gaining the trust of women, as well as utilizing SNS through the job.\n\nSugihara, director of the university's General Student Support Center, who also provides his services at the Kansai Counseling Center in Osaka, condemned Shiraishi for taking advantage of suicidal victims' weaknesses and heightening their psychological dependence on him, saying it was \"just like brainwashing.\"\n\n\"People who are under psychological stress need to seek professional advice at designated service windows instead of trusting just anyone via the internet,\" Sugihara warned.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "A man indicted for murdering and robbing nine people in his apartment in Zama in 2017 seems to have used certain techniques also employed in the field of counseling to gain the trust of suicidal victims before killing them, according to an analysis by a counseling expert.
