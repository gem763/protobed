Whilst the event in itself was a huge achievement for local organisers, given the city\u2019s reputation as a conservative stronghold, the LGBT community was met with violence from counter-protestors. As a result, the event made international news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nWhat happened at Bia\u0142ystok Pride, while horrifying, also wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Since the country\u2019s populist right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) won the 2015 parliamentary election, Poland's LGBT community has increasingly been under siege \u2014 used as a scapegoat to bolster the popularity of the government, whose policies focus on preserving the idea of the \u201ctraditional Polish family\u201d and rejecting what it calls Western \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d.\n\nWith parliamentary elections coming up in October, the Law and Justice party are now intensifying anti-LGBT rhetoric, encouraged by parts of the country\u2019s Catholic Church and some media outlets \u2014 one newspaper, Gazeta Polska started distributing \u201cLGBT-free zone\u201d stickers. But Poland\u2019s LGBT community is mobilising and fighting back, both by organising further Pride marches across the country, fundraising for LGBT organisations, and making themselves visible, such as through the viral campaign #jestemLGBT [I am LGBT].\n\nWe caught up with some of Poland\u2019s LGBT community in the capital Warsaw, to talk about the current political climate, their hopes and fears for the future, and what it\u2019s like to be a young and queer in Poland right now.\n\nAnton, 27\n\nDescribe Poland to someone who\u2019s never been. We\u2019re a country of huge divisions. It\u2019s a country that\u2019s this conservative Catholic place on the one hand, and on the other, is willing to be a western European country. We have this huge tension between the progressive part and the traditional one, and the politicians in Poland know how to play those tensions perfectly.\n\nWhat was it like growing up in the LGBT community in Poland? I grew up among liberal people so I wasn\u2019t really aware of homophobia. When I was coming into my transgender identity, that\u2019s when I realised there\u2019s a lot of transphobia in Poland, especially legally. If you\u2019re transgender and you want to go on hormone treatment then you have to go through a really long process of diagnosis where the so-called specialists ask you so many questions. If you want to change your gender legally then you have to sue your parents for wrongly assuming your gender when you were born \u2013 it\u2019s so shitty.\n\nYou were one of the journalists reporting from Bia\u0142ystok Pride \u2013 what happened? The counter protestors attacked us verbally and physically. They were shouting, \u201cfaggot, fuck off,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d I was live streaming and they were trying to stop me. When the government says we\u2019re a destructive ideology \u2014 not people \u2014 then other people stop seeing the other person in us. Now I\u2019m really scared what will happen if the ruling party wins the election, and how far they\u2019ll go. You never know if you\u2019re just a tool to win an election or if they\u2019re really going to try and change the legislation to make your existence illegal.\n\nNastie, 20\n\nDescribe Poland to someone who\u2019s never been. Angry, lots of talented people though, and cold.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like growing up as a member of the LGBT community here? Stressful. I always wanted to hide from people, especially my family. My father wanted me to join the military, which was fucked up and dumb because I was a petite little gay kid. I think he wanted me to toughen up, but it didn\u2019t work out because I\u2019m a drag queen now.\n\nHave you ever experienced violence in response to your sexuality? One time I went out to buy milk and these two guys came up to me even though I was wearing a big sweatshirt and pants. I didn\u2019t look gay at all but they were calling me a faggot and one slapped me in the face. I ran home, crawled under a blanket and just cried.\n\nWhat do you see for the future of LGBT culture in Poland? I see action. There\u2019s a lot of activists and a lot of artists. One of my friends, who\u2019s also a drag queen, has been signed to a mainstream model agency, so people are recognising our talent.\n\nAre you proud to be Polish? I\u2019m not proud of everything that\u2019s been going on, but I\u2019m happy to have been born here, because I get to be a part of this legacy. In 10-20 years\u2019 time, people are going to remember what my friends, maybe even me, were doing, that we were fighting.\n\nMartyna, 26\n\nWhat was it like growing up as a member of the LGBT community in Poland? I never had an LGBT community. I realised I was queer when I was 11 and at the time, in the 90s and early 00s in Poland there wasn\u2019t a lot of information or openness, so I was really confused and scared. I found a community about three years ago, but it was hard, there was a lot of homophobia still in schools and workplaces, so it\u2019s sometimes not very easy to come out, especially when you\u2019re non-binary.\n\nHow is the LGBT community responding to the ruling party\u2019s propaganda? There\u2019s a lot of protests and information spreading. The \u2018I am LGBT\u2019 viral campaign was also very helpful because you can see people, you can see faces, you can see a real someone behind this four or five letters. It\u2019s important because what we\u2019re lacking is representation in media, in films, in TV shows, in books \u2013 there\u2019s this hole in Poland.\n\nWhat do you foresee for the future of LGBT people in Poland? I see more people coming out. I see changes in language because we don\u2019t have non-binary words, so we have to create them. It makes for a huge opportunity to create something new, to create \u2018Polish queer\u2019 \u2013 something of our own.\n\nAdam, 22\n\nWhat was it like growing up as a member of the LGBT community in Poland? It was pretty hard because not only am I gay but I was the only Asian guy in my neighbourhood. I had to build a kind of fa\u00e7ade to deflect all the bullying and slurs. Some people want to be nice but every day I hear, \u201cYou speak very good Polish.\u201d It\u2019s condescending. I feel treated like an outsider. But I just said, \u201cThank you, so do you.\u201d\n\nWere you shocked by what happened at Bia\u0142ystok Pride? I live in a bubble somewhat, because I try to surround myself with loving and accepting people. Often I forget all the bad things happening around me and I think that\u2019s the case with many LGBT people. So when we hear about something like Bia\u0142ystok the bubble just pops and suddenly we live in this demonic country where evil stuff happens.\n\nDo you think the western media cover issues facing the LGBT community in Poland enough? It\u2019s hard to say. I know the western media covered Bia\u0142ystok Pride, but maybe they should go more in-depth. For now it\u2019s a one-sided story; that Poland is horrifying, terrible. You have to show both sides.\n\nAre you proud to be Polish? Yes, I am proud, I\u2019m grateful that I was born here, it\u2019s a beautiful place, but ideally, I would take down all the borders and erase all the names of the countries.\n\nFilip, 21\n\nWhat are the biggest issues facing the LGBT community in Poland? Obviously not having the same rights as everybody else, but also violence and anger \u2013 I\u2019ve been witness to many instances of discrimination recently. But, hopefully, it will get better.\n\nHow has Bia\u0142ystok affected you as a member of the LGBT community? Because this event got so much recognition, a lot of things have happened. I see there are many more LGBT marches in Poland than there were a year or two ago, and they happen in the smaller cities which I think is very uplifting. The community wants to show that something is truly wrong \u2014 they really want to make a difference.\n\nDo you have any LGBT role models within Polish mainstream culture? Within the mainstream culture, there\u2019s only really [politician] Robert Biedro\u0144. I\u2019m much more inspired by the actions of [music collective] Oramics [who following Bia\u0142ystok released the compilation Total Solidarity to fundraise for Polish LGBT organisations] for example, because they come from the underground and they\u2019re trying to get recognition worldwide. I think they\u2019re the best example right now.\n\nMarianna, 18\n\nWhat are the biggest issues facing young LGBT people in Poland? I think lack of acceptance from your family and rejection from your friends are the worst things that you can face as an LGBT person. It\u2019s often the case that young people\u2019s parents have warned them not to have contact with LGBT people, or the media and political propaganda have.\n\nWhat are you afraid of? Violence. Not being able to go out with my loved one and hold hands in public as heterosexuals do. Also being seen as a bad person because I\u2019m part of the LGBT community \u2013 it\u2019s not right to only see us only through the prism of being LGBT.\n\nDo you have any role models within the Polish LGBT community in Poland? My friends who are open about their sexuality. They\u2019re my biggest inspiration.\n\nAre you proud to be Polish? Sometimes I am. It hurts a little when you meet someone from another country and they don\u2019t know much about Poland. While the political situation is kind of embarrassing here, it\u2019s not our fault.\n\nSimon, 26\n\nHow does being a member of the LGBT community in Warsaw compare to your hometown? Nobody knew I was gay until I moved out of my hometown of Cz\u0119stochowa in southern Poland. Maybe a bit before, when I got accepted at university, I told a few of my friends, but I was hiding it for the most part because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out with my classmates if they knew. It\u2019s so much safer to live in Warsaw. When I go back home I often experience homophobia \u2014 somebody once spat in my face.\n\nDo you worry about things getting worse if Law and Justice get re-elected? If they get re-elected it will probably stay the same \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine how it can get worse, are we going to get prosecuted? I don\u2019t see that happening while we\u2019re still in the European Union. But you can feel our government wants out \u2014 they\u2019ll try to exit at some point.\n\nWhat are the biggest misconceptions about Poland? That we\u2019re cheap labour and that we only do physical work.\n\nCredits\n\nText Kamila Rymajdo\n\nPhotography Heather Glazzard\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Following the violent abuse faced by many queer activists in Poland, under the country's right wing Law and Justice Party, we speak to seven young LGBT people in Poland to find out the reality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d94b7991b545200080badb4/lede/1570032337435-poland-lgbt-lead.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.5619xh;0xw,0.2737xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
