It could also opt instead to renovate the existing stadium.\n\nBoth projects would bring the fans closer to the field than the existing stadium and both also give a nod to the old stadium.\n\nManica\u2019s designs would see the old pitch preserved and in a park for the whole city, while Populous plans to put a museum on the site of the old field, with the entrance where the center circle was.\n\nThe Italoamerican firm Manica\u2019s project includes two rings interlocked, with panels of individual fans\u2019 faces on the exterior.\n\nThe stadium designed by Populous - an American firm - has echoes of famous Milan sites such as the Duomo and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and incorporates a gallery covered by glass.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Inter Milan and AC Milan have unveiled the two shortlisted projects for their proposed new stadium, which would see the demolition of their iconic Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at San Siro.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Daniella Matar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/italy_soccer_serie_a_81714_c0-286-4351-2822_s1770x1032.jpg?4f1e90d0b2f723d0a5d28744a893c28a992b1bce", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
