But what is it like to go viral and how does it change their lives?\n\n\u201cPeople have died because of austerity,\u201d a woman told Boris Johnson, buttonholing him in Doncaster last week. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us that austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now.\u201d It was her words, caught on cameras and phones, that hit a nerve, because she spoke for so many. No one remembers what Johnson said, or what he was doing there. Only yesterday, a man with a sick daughter berated the PM in a London hospital over waiting times, and on years and years and years of the \u201cNHS being destroyed\u201d.\n\nA couple of weeks earlier it was the Portuguese woman who hijacked a live Sky News broadcast with an emotional plea. After 20 years living and working in Britain she didn\u2019t know whether she was still welcome. \u201cI need a voice, I gave this country my youth,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked after your children, I\u2019ve looked after the elderly.\u201d\n\nAnd who can forget Brenda from Bristol. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d she spluttered at the man from the BBC, when he asked her about Theresa May\u2019s decision to hold a snap election. \u201cNot another one! Oh for God\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t stand this. There\u2019s too much politics going on at the moment.\u201d Brenda was surprised by the fuss, then annoyed. \u201cOh God no, go away,\u201d she yelled from a window at some journalists recently when they called for her wisdom. These are the viral stars of Brexit Britain, the ordinary folk who are suddenly and briefly catapulted into the limelight. With a sentence or two, or just a look, they strike a chord with the nation. What is it like for them? What happens after their brief moments of fame? Does it make any difference? I caught up with a few \u2013 all of them women, because, interestingly, most of them are \u2013 to find out.\n\nHarriet Ellis, #EyeRollGirl: \u2018I ended up voting leave\u2019\n\nHarriet Ellis was in the queue to board the flight for her holiday. \u201cThe woman in front and her boyfriend kept taking selfies,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s so weird, why do you want to remember this moment, being in the Ryanair queue? And I kept getting in the picture, so I was dodging, I didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment for them. Then I looked over at her phone and I just saw loads of pictures of my face. The woman had Googled me and was checking the picture to see if it was me.\u201d\n\nThen there was the time in Tesco, in Bristol. \u201cThis woman had the strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world, she was like [puts on strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world]: \u2018Oh my God, your eyes are a legend.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Thanks very much.\u2019\u201d\n\nEllis\u2019s eyes are a legend. They achieved this status in November when their owner was sitting right behind Nigel Farage in a Channel 4 Brexit debate. It was his claim that Theresa May was delivering a \u201cremainer\u2019s Brexit\u201d that caused them to perform what has been described as a \u201cdouble axis roll\u201d. The clip went viral, Harriet became #EyeRollGirl.\n\nShe was a student at Birmingham University at the time and got an email asking if she wanted to be in the audience for the debate. \u201cI was like: I might as well, I\u2019ve got nothing else to do,\u201d she says. She is interested in politics and has always talked about it at home: \u201cI know a bit, not like loads.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:13 Harriet Ellis rolls eyes over Nigel Farage's remarks during Channel 4 Brexit debate \u2013 video\n\nShe was not aware of the roll at the time, didn\u2019t even know she was a roller, although afterwards her mum told her she\u2019d had plenty of practice; she had spent years rolling her eyes at her. But after the debate someone asked if she had checked her phone. \u201cOh God, is someone dead? No, but there were 3,000 views on this gif, and I was like: wow, that\u2019s fun. Then we were in the car on the way home and it just snowballed. If people were concentrating on my eyes it mustn\u2019t have been that interesting a debate.\u201d\n\nAt home she stayed up, looking at \u2013 and engaging with \u2013 all the reaction, even though she had a really important interview for a post-grad teaching degree at Oxford the following day. It was 99% nice, she says, 1% abuse. A man in Canada said he would like to take her out to dinner and propose to her.\n\nIn the morning, her phone wasn\u2019t working. \u201cIt overheated from all the notifications. It took a while to calm down, I had 68,000 likes in 24 hours.\u201d On the way to her interview she spoke to newspapers and magazines. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re on top of the world. I think it helped with the interview.\u201d\n\nAnyway, she got in, and will start the course this autumn \u2013 teaching in a secondary school (religious education, not politics). Does she think she has got Farage to thank for her career? \u201cHe did give me some confidence,\u201d she says.\n\nExtraordinarily, in the referendum, Ellis voted to\u2026 leave! (Now who\u2019s doing the double-axis eye-roll?) But this had nothing to do with Farage. \u201cI was at sixth form at the time; this was my first time voting; I was very interested in Lexit, leftwing Brexit, reading about how the EU promotes the immigration of white westerners and is sort of like a racist ideology in that it is at the expense of immigration from more deserving countries and people of colour. Also I didn\u2019t like the fact that you didn\u2019t know who was running it; you didn\u2019t directly vote for the people at the top, and no one knows who their MEP is.\u201d She would probably vote differently now though, because of the way it has turned out. \u201cIt\u2019s an omnishambles, as Malcolm Tucker would say.\u201d\n\nAna Telma Rocha, #PortugueseBrexitWoman: \u2018I thought they\u2019d cut it because I was just another nutter\u2019\u2019\n\nAna Telma Rocha came to this country from Portugal in 1999. It made her into the liberal, tolerant person she is, she says. \u201cI was super-Catholic, a xenophobe, I thought gay people were dangerous. It educated me, it\u2019s been wonderful and I love it.\u201d\n\nBut, she says, recently the UK has become unrecognisable. In 2016, she was walking down the street in Sheffield, where she was living with one of her two sons. A man accelerated towards her at a crossing, stopping only metres from them. \u201cHe said: \u2018Go back to your country, foreign scum.\u2019\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s when she decided her boys \u2013 one of whom has autism \u2013 would go to live in Portugal while she stayed here to work. \u201cThe toughest decision,\u201d she says, choking up. She moved to London, to carry on her work as a carer for an agency. She gets moved around the country; when we speak she is on her way to a job in Suffolk. She has also worked as an actor.\n\nIt was after Johnson announced that he was suspending parliament that Rocha \u201cabsolutely lost it\u201d. \u201cI saw that this guy was going to push a no deal when the [EU] settlement scheme hadn\u2019t even gone through and everything rushed to my head. I said: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to go down to Westminster to get arrested.\u2019\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:39 'I need a voice': Portuguese woman's Brexit plea \u2013 video\n\nShe was not arrested, but she did interrupt a Sky TV broadcast covering the protests. \u201cI need a voice,\u201d she said, passionately. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for 20 years and I have no voice. The resettlement scheme is not working.\u201d She did not realise it was a live show. \u201cI thought, I don\u2019t know, that they\u2019d cut it, because I was just another nutter off the street. But then everybody started to ring me and I thought: \u2018God, this has gone a bit mad.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoon she became Portuguese Brexit Woman, getting sympathy and abuse, especially when it emerged that she had helped set up a theatre company. She was a planted remoaner stooge, it was clearly fake news. \u201cI knew that as soon as they found out I\u2019m an actress they would say it was fake news,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there were many more nice messages than \u2013 sorry \u2013 those idiots.\u201d\n\nRocha\u2019s main issue \u2013 like many other EU citizens in the UK, has been the laborious process \u2013 of applying for the EU settlement scheme; having to navigate seemingly endless technical issues, error messages and helpline hell while working up to 65 hours a week. Not as simple as the Home Office made out. But since her impassioned TV outburst, she has heard directly from the Portuguese consulate, which has offered to help. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of Portugal,\u201d she says. There is no such warmth towards Johnson. \u201cGod forgive him for what he\u2019s done to England.\u201d\n\nAmelia McDowell, Question Time\u2019s \u2018future prime minister\u2019: \u2018My mate said you\u2019ve hit a million views\u2019\n\nAmelia McDowell, 16, remembers getting the call. She was in the middle of an art class, at her school in Belfast. \u201cI checked my voice messages and there was this really posh British woman. I said to my teacher: \u2018This is important, do you mind if I get it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe teacher agreed, McDowell went into the art cupboard, sat down among all the paint and the clay and called the woman back. \u201cShe\u2019s asking me all these questions and I try to answer as best as I can with these pots of paint falling on my head, then she\u2019s like: \u2018That\u2019s brilliant, we\u2019d love to have you, we\u2019ll send you the tickets.\u2019 I hung up and just screamed.\u201d\n\nTickets to a concert? The X Factor? Oh no. \u201cI burst out of the art store and went, to my whole class: \u2018I\u2019M GOING TO BE ON QUESTION TIME!\u2019\u201d\n\nMcDowell watches the BBC politics debate every week. When there was an announcement that the show would be coming to Belfast (\u201cIt never comes to Belfast!\u201d) she immediately applied to be in the audience.\n\nA few days later, Dad dropped her off at the venue. \u201cI knew I wanted to say something but it wasn\u2019t like I had completely thought it out, it was mostly spontaneous.\u201d What she did, when she got the chance, was to calmly deliver a damning indictment of the Conservative party. \u201cDavid Cameron made the referendum policy because he didn\u2019t want to risk losing 10 or 15 seats to Ukip, and look where it has got us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has always been because Tories are playing party politics with issues that are going to be huge, generational changes for all of us.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Teenager delivers damning indictment of Tory party during Question Time \u2013 video\n\nShe was soon being hailed for her eloquence and clarity. She set up a Twitter account, wrote: \u201cHi, this is me,\u201d under her clip, and collected 8,000 followers overnight. Celebrities \u2013 Rob Delaney, Richard Bacon, Amanda Abbington \u2013 were retweeting it; here was the human embodiment of the argument to give the vote to 16-year-olds (a campaign that McDowell is now part of).\n\nIn English class the next morning, \u201cfriends kept refreshing their phones under the desk, and going: \u2018It\u2019s on 215,000 views now.\u2019 I remember when my mate Erin just stood up and said it had hit a million. That night my friend Amy rang and she\u2019s like: \u2018Mimi, your video\u2019s on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Twitter!\u2019 Then I checked my Twitter and like John McDonnell\u2019s followed me! What\u2019s going on?\u201d It was really good, to have a platform at last, and to know people don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re talking crap when it comes to politics. But also part of me is like: there are like so many young activists my age or maybe a bit older who maybe have an understanding like mine or close to it but didn\u2019t have the chance to go on Question Time and say something. That was luck and I\u2019m very thankful for it.\u201d\n\nMcDowell has certainly used her moment in the spotlight: she has been on the radio and written articles, and says she would have done more if her GCSEs had not got in the way. She is at sixth-form college now doing French, English language and biology. Not politics, incidentally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seem up myself but it\u2019s mainly things that I do already have a good understanding of.\u201d That is very clear. As well as school, and school orchestra (violin), she is a Labour party of Northern Ireland youth activist.\n\nAt the end of her Question Time speech she called for a general election. Is that still what she wants? \u201cThere\u2019s obviously the danger of being so close to Brexit now, and I am quite worried that it will become another Brexit election, and we will end up with the Tories again, but I think Boris Johnson\u2019s recent moves have been an electoral disaster. I do not think he\u2019s going to get back in. So honestly part of me really wants an election because we probably would get an extension to do it and I think another government would get in even if Labour needs to be propped up for a while.\u201d\n\nAfter college, she hopes to go to university \u2013 Oxford is the aim, otherwise Edinburgh or UCL \u2013 to study French and Russian, and then eventually go into politics. There were people saying she should be prime minister after Question Time; what did she make of that? \u201cI\u2019m not saying right now, but maybe in the future like, if the opportunity comes up I\u2019m willing to take it.\u201d #VoteMimi\n\nKirsty Archer, evicted renter: \u2018It shows people can actually change things\u2019\n\nWhen Kirsty Archer complained to her landlord about the state of disrepair of the London flat she rented, she was served with an eviction order. Then, following the announcement that the government was going to scrap these section 21 eviction notices \u2013 which enable landlords to evict tenants for no reason at all, so long as they give them two months\u2019 notice \u2013 she agreed to be interviewed on Sky News. It did not quite go as expected.\n\n\u201cI thought if you are a case study you would have the chance to talk about what happened to you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t really go like that. She was quite critical of me; it emerged during the interview that she had been a landlord herself. I was quite surprised about the line of questioning.\u201d\n\nShe is the Sky journalist \u2013 and landlord \u2013 Jayne Secker. \u201cThat\u2019s just the housing market isn\u2019t it?\u201d Secker said to Archer, on air, about the extortionate rents in London. And she went on to have a moan about some of her own experiences renting out properties to young people who don\u2019t know how to do anything around the house and can\u2019t even change a lightbulb. It had gone from a piece about scrapping section 21 to the woes of being a property owner, and Archer came away thinking it had gone really badly. \u201cShe said at the end that I swore, and apologised for me swearing.\u201d (Archer had used the term \u201cpissed off\u201d.)\n\nPlay Video 2:21 Sky News presenter Jayne Secker interviews Kirsty Archer \u2013 video\n\nArcher\u2019s flatmate \u2013 and fellow evictee \u2013 did not think it had gone so badly for her, and did the sensible thing in the situation: he uploaded the clip to Twitter. Two days later \u2013 after retweets from, among others, Owen Jones, Philip Pullman and Ellie Goulding \u2013 it had garnered 4m views. The story then not only returned to being one about renters\u2019 rights, but now it also became one about patronising journalists who are wildly out of touch with the living situations of the nation\u2019s young people, and woefully ignorant of the renting crisis. Secker ended up apologising, saying that she \u201cgot the tone and content of an interview wrong\u201d and had \u201ctaken the many comments on board\u201d.\n\n\u201cObviously it resonated with a lot of people,\u201d Archer says. \u201cI think one of the nicest things was all the comments from random people online saying well done and it\u2019s so good you are speaking out for us.\u201d\n\nArcher works for the charity Rethink Mental Illness and knows a thing or two about the link between housing and mental health. She is one of the lucky ones; she got a platform. Since \u2013 and as a result of \u2013 her TV appearance she has been to the annual OECD forum in Paris, sat on panels, spoken in schools. \u201cI think it shows that if people take action and are willing to do something rather than just letting it happen, then they can actually change things and help maybe more than just themselves.\u201d\n\nThe renting situation is still rubbish. The ban on letting fees is positive, likewise scrapping section 21s, although that hasn\u2019t come into effect yet, and who knows when it will, with everything else going on. Archer is renting a new place in Streatham, south London, \u00a3675 a month plus bills. The washing machine broke, but it got fixed. \u201cThe landlord is a lot more reasonable this time.\u201d", "description": "Every day, ordinary people seem to cut through political debate and speak truth to power.
