There's no excuse for doing something you hate. I don't care if you're in debt or have a terrible family life. What are you going to do about it? Stop complaining, start hustling, and change it.\n\nThen constantly remind yourself: Why do you do what you do? If you catch yourself thinking that it's \"just a job,\" you need to change your mindset. It's like the parable of the three bricklayers: When asked what they're doing, one says, \"Laying bricks\"; another says, \"Building a wall\"; and the third says, \"Building a cathedral.\" If there is anything I could wish upon you, more than my work ethic or energy, it would be mindset and perspective, and the conviction that what you are doing is important.\n\n\u2014 Gary Vaynerchuk, founder and CEO of VaynerX; five-time New York Times bestselling authorof \"Crushing It!\"", "description": "Happiness doesn't just happen \u2014\u00a0it's hard work.
