It's about stopping the Republicans who enabled him.", "language": "en", "text": "Democrats must show that Republicans made Trump\u2019s corruption inevitable and count on 2020 voters to end this nightmare. They are our last resort.\n\nPresident Donald Trump keeps racking up high crimes like they\u2019re rounds of taxpayer-funded golf, threatening civil war or execution as punishment for any attempt to hold him accountable. You would assume he\u2019s the greatest threat to democracy that we face.\n\nBut you would be wrong. The Republicans in Congress who are inviting Trump to continue his torching of the Constitution are the greatest threat to this republic that any of us will ever see. And impeachment will fail unless it exposes this complicit and cowardly GOP.\n\nAt long last, we\u2019ve finally arrived at a serious effort to hold accountable a man who has been violating his oath of office since the words came out of his mouth. But for this process to be a success, it needs to do more than charge the most obviously corrupt president in American history for posterity or even help us \u201cactually find out every rotten thing he and his kids have been up to,\u201d as The New Republic put it.\n\nFounders foresaw Trump nightmare\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it focuses strictly on charges that follow from the government whistleblower\u2019s depiction of Trump pressing the president of Ukraine to frame his political opponents, or expands to encompass all his multifarious documented abuses from obstruction of justice to his corrupt, endless and multifaceted self-enrichment.\n\nImpeachment must have a singular goal: It must make the case that our democracy is at stake. To do this, Democrats must show that the GOP made Trump\u2019s corruption inevitable. Thus, the American people must check the Republican Party with furious anger.\n\nPresident Donald Trump at the Congressional Republican Leadership Retreat at Camp David, Maryland, in 2018. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe Founders clearly anticipated that we\u2019d eventually endure a wannabe tyrant. Their fears of an aspiring dictator sound like the Hollywood Medium summoning the nightmare of this reality star presidency.\n\nJames Madison worried about a president who might \u201cpervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers.\u201d\n\nAlexander Hamilton warned that a man \"unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents \u2026 despotic in his ordinary demeanour \u2014 known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty\" might \"throw things into confusion that he may \u2018ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.' \"\n\nGeorge Mason asked, \u201cShall the man who has practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?\u201d\n\nTextbook impeachable offenses\n\nTrump\u2019s conduct, as The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer argues, is \u201cwhy the impeachment clause exists.\u201d But Serwer could not foresee the colossal chickenheartedness of the Republican Party. The Founders could not predict that a quasi dictator would be effectively invited to commit crimes, knowing that even if the people's House impeaches him, he will always have the 34 votes needed for acquittal in a Senate trial.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s first two years, the GOP Congress did its best to enable Trump\u2019s corruption. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions relented and allowed one somewhat unfettered investigation by the special counsel office, led by Robert Mueller.\n\nFight this 'new normal': With Trump's call for China to investigate Bidens, he's not even hiding\n\nThen came the installation of Attorney General William Barr, who holds what amounts to a papal infallibility theory for Republican presidents. Barr has allowed Trump to evade the impeachable findings of Mueller\u2019s report. Since then, Trump and his \u201clawyers\u201d seem to have marshaled the awesome power of the presidency in an attempt to destroy a possible 2020 opponent and undermine the official finding that Russia interfered in our 2016 elections. They\u2019re virtually begging for Russian President Vladimir Putin to repeat these attacks on U.S. democracy.\n\nThe most contemptible aspect of Trump\u2019s efforts is the direct involvement of Barr, whom the president mentioned repeatedly on the call pressing Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Biden family and whose department decided there was nothing to investigate, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was on the call and whose diplomats were involved as well. The American people no longer have a State Department or a Department of Justice. Those are now Trump properties \u2014 and you know what they say about Trump properties. They're infested.\n\n2020 voters are our last resort\n\nWith an administration that objects to any oversight by the people\u2019s House and a Department of Justice far more interested in hiding Trump\u2019s taxes than looking into the Trump administration\u2019s crimes, the importance of impeachment now extends beyond what even the Founders imagined.\n\nIt is the only hope for checking a lawless president who has no interest in fair elections or anything that threatens his grip on power.\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell successfully quashed a bipartisan response to foreign interference in our elections, which we now know was welcomed by the president\u2019s campaign. McConnell did this in private, and voters only found out after the election.\n\nPolitical opposites agree: How Democrats should impeach Trump\n\nMcConnell, who is up for reelection next year, is now raising money by calling himself \"the ONLY thing stopping Nancy Pelosi from impeaching President Trump.\" Barring a miraculous 11th hour conversion, he will endorse Trump\u2019s betrayal of our self-governance on the floor of the Senate. And at this point, it looks like Republicans in Congress will wager any sacred honor they have left right along with him.\n\nThis likely won\u2019t be enough to shame a party with no soul to save. But it will make the case to Americans that We the People are the only check our democracy has left.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors and host of \"The GOTMFV Show\" podcast.
