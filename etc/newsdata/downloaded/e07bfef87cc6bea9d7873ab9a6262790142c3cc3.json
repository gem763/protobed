The goal is to explain to the public the reasoning and relevance of any eventual impeachment charges.\n\nDemocratic House committee chairs and leaders are still debating the need for additional articles or charges that extend beyond the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been adamant that the case against Trump must be targeted and easy to communicate in order to build public support, according to those familiar with discussions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
