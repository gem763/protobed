And they didn\u2019t have it. And we\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, that you can\u2019t get under.\u201d\n\nTrump habitually exaggerates the state of construction of his border wall, but the line qualified as impressively false even out of his mouth. The southern border of Colorado is about 400 miles from Mexico.\n\nThe governor of Colorado, Democrat Jared Polis, dunked on Trump on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWell this is awkward,\u201d Polis wrote. \u201c...Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico. Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nOthers on social media suggested that if the Trump administration does set out to build a border wall in Colorado, perhaps New Mexico, which borders Colorado to the south, would pay for it.\n\nOthers compared the moment to an episode in Trump\u2019s follies from earlier this year, in which the president, sitting in the Oval Office and holding up a map, tried to defend his assertion that Hurricane Dorian threatened the state of Alabama, an assertion that became known as \u201csharpiegate\u201d and the national weather service had hurried to try to correct. On Trump\u2019s map, someone had used a heavy black marker to alter the projected course of the storm.\n\nTrump was up after midnight on Twitter trying to control the fallout. As with his past outrageous riffs, recently including one in which he asked China to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, the explanation was he was only kidding \u2013 it was a joke!\n\nTrump tweeted (spelling his):\n\n(Kiddingly) We\u2019re building a Wall in Colorado\u201d(then stated, \u201cwe\u2019re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we\u2019re building on the Border\u201d) refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\n\nWhile some Trump superfans do travel great distances to attend his rallies, the presence or not of Coloradoans and Kansans in the Pittsburgh crowd could not be established.", "description": "The southern border of Colorado is about 400 miles from Mexico as governor Jared Polis dunked on Trump on Twitter", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7f2f833de8b7abcf25c507b4c3cde8c47ccb06/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e7582cac89a40dd868936f440433845", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
