Syria is friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well protected -- plus they know how to fight. And by the way, they\u2019re no angels. But they were with us \u2026\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand -- they\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there so there\u2019s a lot of sand that they could play with. \u2026 Our view [of] the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They\u2019ve gotta work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting. Syria\u2019s protecting the Kurds. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019S @frankthorp on Trump saying what\u2019s going on in Syria is not America\u2019s problem: \u201cGRAHAM just now reacting to this: \u2018If the President did say that Turkey\u2019s invasion is no concern to us I find that to be an outstanding\u2014an astonishing statement which I completely and totally reject.\u2019\u201d\n\nMORE TRUMP this afternoon at a joint press conference following the meeting with Mattarella: \u201cFrankly, if Russia\u2019s going to help in protecting the Kurds, that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\n-- MUSIC TO RAND PAUL\u2019S EARS: \u201cA lot of companies want to fight because they make their weapons based on fighting, not based on peace, and they take care of a lot of people.

She said Mr. Sondland extensively used a personal cellphone for official diplomatic business and repeatedly told foreign officials they were welcome to come to the White House whenever they liked.\u201d NYT\n\n-- HAPPENING NOW \u2026 \u201cPompeo adviser to decry politicization of State Dept. in impeachment probe testimony,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Carol Morello and John Hudson: \u201cMichael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until his sudden resignation last week, will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday that career diplomats were mistreated during his tenure and some had their careers derailed for political reasons, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\n\u201cMcKinley will outline how his concerns culminated with the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a punitive action he and many other rank-and-file diplomats viewed as wholly unjustified. \u2026 The person familiar with McKinley\u2019s statement said the veteran diplomat will not criticize Pompeo directly, though he will discuss his concern over the politicization of the agency in the Trump administration.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cRick Perry won\u2019t commit to answering subpoena,\u201d by Eric Wolff and Anthony Adragna\n\nRUDY\u2019S WORLD -- \u201cFourth defendant in Giuliani associates\u2019 case arrested at New York airport,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Devlin Barrett: \u201cDavid Correia, the fourth defendant in a campaign finance case involving business associates of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W.

And while most other candidates have even less in their bank accounts, which could force some of them from the race before Iowa, the former vice president is set to be seriously outspent in the advertising and organizing battles that will soon ramp up in the first caucus state.\u201d POLITICO\n\nOPIOID FILES -- \u201cDrug Distributors in Talks to Settle Opioid Litigation for $18 Billion,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Sara Randazzo: \u201cThe three distributors\u2014 McKesson Corp. , AmerisourceBergen Corp. , and Cardinal Health Inc. \u2014would collectively pay $18 billion over 18 years under the deal currently on the table, the people said. Johnson & Johnson is also involved in the discussions \u2026\n\n\u201cThe agreement still needs to garner support from factions of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and government entities with differing interests. \u2026 The looming deadline of the trial slated to begin Monday before Judge [Dan] Polster, in the cases of Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga and Summit counties, has hastened the discussions. \u2026 Any global resolution by the distributors could affect or delay the trial, though jury selection was still set to begin Wednesday.\u201d WSJ\n\nDAVID SHULKIN SPEAKS \u2026 TIME: \u201cI Ran the VA Under President Trump Until He Fired Me.

And she said that\u2019s what happened.
