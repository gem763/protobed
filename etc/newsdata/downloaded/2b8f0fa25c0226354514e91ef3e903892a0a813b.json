REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Nearly one in 12 employees working in the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market has witnessed sexual harassment there in the past year and a quarter have seen excessive drinking, according to a culture survey published by Lloyd\u2019s on Tuesday.\n\nThe market, which employees around 45,000 people in insurance and broking firms, is trying to improve standards of behavior after reports earlier this year of sexual harassment and day-time drinking.\n\nEight percent of respondents had seen sexual harassment at Lloyd\u2019s in the last 12 months and 24% had seen \u201cexcessive consumption of alcohol\u201d, according to the Lloyd\u2019s survey which had 6,000 responses. Twenty-two percent had seen people at their firms ignore inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can deny there is a problem to address here,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s Chief Executive John Neal told Reuters by telephone, adding that publishing the survey in its \u201cugly raw fashion\u201d should help bring about change.\n\nLloyd\u2019s has already introduced sanctions for poor behavior, including potential life bans on entering its City tower.\n\nIt said on Tuesday it was taking further action in response to the survey, including introducing a gender balance plan, business conduct requirements and setting up an advisory group chaired by Lloyd\u2019s board member Fiona Luck.\n\nSixty percent of the survey respondents were men and 90% of respondents based in London.", "description": "Nearly one in 12 employees working in the Lloyd's of London insurance market has witnessed sexual harassment there in the past year and a quarter have seen excessive drinking, according to a culture survey published by Lloyd's on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Carolyn Cohn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433122622&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M287", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
