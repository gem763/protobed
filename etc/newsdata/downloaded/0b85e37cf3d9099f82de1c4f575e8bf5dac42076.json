(ACB\u2013 Get Report) is the latest of several major marijuana companies to post disappointing earnings results, sending ACB shares plummeting 9% in after-hours trading on September 11. Investors took fright after ACB revealed weak earnings guidance and a significant fourth quarter revenue miss. Indeed, Tilray (TLRY), Canopy Growth (CGC) and Acreage Holdings (ACRGF) have all reported weak top-line outcomes in part due to issues with packaging and growing that have bogged down the Canadian legal recreational cannabis market.\n\nAmid overall weakness among the largest players in the space, investors want to know where Aurora goes from here. Indeed we can see from TipRanks that ACB currently shows a Very Negative investor sentiment right now. That's with investors selling on both a 7-day and 30-day perspective.\n\nSo should you buck the trend and snap up Aurora now? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nWhat Went Wrong?\n\nAccording to its Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings release, ACB posted a net loss of CA$2.26 million despite generating net revenues of CA$98.94. While revenue gained 52% from the prior-year quarter, the figure fell below the CA$108 million consensus estimate. For the full year, the company said its net loss was CA$297.9 million on CA$247.9 million in net revenues.\n\nThis was especially troubling as the company already lowered Q4 guidance back in August, telling investors that it was now expecting to see revenues between CA$100 million to CA$107 million. Management attributed the miss to the slow roll-out of retail outlets for recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian consumer channel continues to experience challenges at the retail level in key markets and resolution of this issue is beyond the Company's control. Aurora is working closely with all our regulatory and channel partners to streamline distribution as the Company continues to track toward positive adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile management believes ACB is on the right track, it isn\u2019t expecting to reach profitability until fiscal 2020, later than it previously stated.\n\nInvestors did get some good news as production volume increased 86% quarter-over-quarter to reach 29,034 kilos thanks to its new cultivation facilities. Sales also jumped from just 9,160 kilograms in the previous quarter to reach 17,793 kilograms.\n\nWhat Now?\n\nInvestors have expressed concern that even with a dramatic increase in sales, the company pushed back its profitability timeline. It doesn\u2019t help that its overall average net selling price fell from CA$6.40 per gram in the third quarter to CA$5.32 in the fourth quarter as a result of low selling prices in the consumer and wholesale bulk markets.\n\nThat being said, ACB still has a lot going for it. Problems with production that have previously weighed on the company no longer appear to be an issue.What's more, gross margin also improved, suggesting that the company has made significant progress in its efforts to cut production costs per gram.\n\nNot to mention the Cannabis 2.0 market, or the upcoming derivative legalization in Canada, presents new opportunities for ACB. To capitalize on this emerging market, several new products are slated for a December launch including cannabis-infused hard baked goods, chocolates and mints.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aurora Cannabis Inc.
