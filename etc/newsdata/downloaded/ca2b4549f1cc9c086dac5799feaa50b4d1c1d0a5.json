And what it set up is the simplest and most captivating of affairs: Game 7, Scherzer against Zack Greinke, at stake what they have played for the past seven months and exactly to where this series has barrelled for a good week-and-a-half.\n\nThe arguments, the exasperation, the anger, the absurdity, none of it altered an outcome fueled by Strasburg, who pitched into the ninth inning and won for the second time in the World Series and the fifth time in the postseason, and by an imprecise Verlander, who is 0-2 in this World Series and 0-6 across four of them. And by Rendon, who homered, doubled twice and drove in five runs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese were the Nationals of the unexpected summertime run of clean and relevant baseball. The Nationals of real fight. So, on their way to Game 7, after having been swamped in three home games over a terribly long \u2014 for them \u2014 weekend in D.C., they got after that fight again, when a seventh-inning call went against them, and for a good five minutes everyone stood around and watched them go to pieces.\n\nPlate umpire Sam Holbrook ruled Nationals baserunner Trea Turner had interfered with a throw from Astros pitcher Brad Peacock, based on his positioning near \u2014 but not on \u2014 the first base line. Martinez disagreed, with apparently decent reason. He attempted to protest the game, though rules state a judgement call \u2014 non-reviewable under baseball\u2019s replay restrictions \u2014 may not be protested. Nevertheless, he demanded a rules-check replay, so two umpires put on headsets and called the replay center in New York and also attempted to call operations chief Joe Torre, who was sitting maybe 50 feet away. Torre said his phone never rang. Besides, the call had been made (correctly, according to the umpires and Torre, who arrived at a postgame news conference with his thumb designating the proper page in the official rule book, which he later read aloud), and in the end all any of it did was delay the Nationals\u2019 victory.\n\nWashington Nationals manager Dave Martinez has to be restrained after being ejected for arguing an interference call during the seventh inning of Game 6 of the World Series. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\nTo sum up, Martinez was asked afterward what it was he was protesting there and he said, \u201cHonestly, nothing. Because I knew you couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen the conversation one day turns to the game within the game, the tiny battles \u2014 some significant, some not, some cheekily petty \u2014 within the game that fed the final result, the topic will be Verlander and Strasburg, of course, and Martinez and the umpires (and bench coach Chip Hale\u2019s worthy attempts to divert his manager), and also Alex Bregman and Juan Soto, for what they did and how they celebrated it, and then how Tim Bogar and Don Kelly also played parts in the drama.\n\nBogar and Kelly are first base coaches, Bogar for the Nationals and Kelly for the Astros. Generally, they stand to the right of first base and mind their business, timing pitchers in their deliveries to the plate and keeping track of the outs. On Tuesday night, they served also as post home run bat racks, as Game 6 devolved into playground warfare.\n\nThis is, perhaps, what comes of two teams of 25 men each spending just a little too much time together, when small acts of mirth and high spiritedness become challenges to another\u2019s manhood, and when Bregman homered in the first inning he found himself all the way to first base with his bat still in his hand. Maybe he froze trying to think of a suitable bat flip, then found himself at first base, at which point he handed the bat to Kelly, who fumbled the bat, which ended up in the dirt beside first base. Bregman looked back over his shoulder. He later apologized, saying, \u201cI let my emotions get the best of me. I\u2019m sorry for doing that.\u201d\n\nFour innings later, with the score tied, 2-2, the 21-year-old Soto hit a ball into the second deck in right field. Several seconds and 90 feet after the ball was struck, he dropped his bat at Kelly\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cIt looked cool,\u201d he said of Bregman\u2019s bat trip. \u201cI wanted to do it too.\u201d\n\nHe grinned.\n\nAfterward, the managers agreed that this sort of self-aggrandizing reflected poorly on their players and their organizations.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Martinez said of Bregman\u2019s show. \u201cAnd the fact that Soto did it, I\u2019ll be quite honest with you, I didn\u2019t like it when he did it.\u201d\n\nSaid Astros manager A.J. Hinch: \u201cYeah, [Bregman] shouldn\u2019t carry the bat past first base. Soto shouldn\u2019t carry the bat to first base either.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals forced a World Series Game 7 with a 7-2 win over the Houston Astros. (Alex Trautwig/Getty Images)\n\nThey\u2019re getting on each other\u2019s nerves, which is how these things go, which is how these things should go, which is how they get to Game 7.\n\nWhich was, through Game 6.\n\nThe Nationals hadn\u2019t had a lot of leads of late.\n\nIn their efforts to win/survive/suffocate Game 6, to spend another 27 or 28 hours in pursuit of a championship, the Nationals scored a run in the top of the first inning against Verlander, which was not insignificant.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t held a lead in the series since Game 2. Nearly a week had passed. They\u2019d played from behind for 25 of 27 innings, the two exceptions being the first innings of Games 3 and 5. They\u2019d spent a lot of time looking up at the Astros, struggling to put runners in scoring position, then failing with the handful of runners who got there, and they ultimately boarded a flight to Houston for at least one elimination game \u2014 two \u2014 if they were to have any luck at all against Verlander. They finished Verlander early. They rode Strasburg for all but the final two outs. They had the big, loud hits. They took the soul of the big, lively crowd. They piled on late. They walked into the second-to-last game of 2019 as some of the only people in the ballpark who expected it to be the second-to-last game of 2019. Who could do something about it. Who made the pitches and put up the runs. Who protested the un-protestable.\n\nThat only left Game 7, and whatever nest that comes buried in.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "They\u2019re getting on each other\u2019s nerves, which is how these things go, which is how these things should go, which is how they get to Game 7.
