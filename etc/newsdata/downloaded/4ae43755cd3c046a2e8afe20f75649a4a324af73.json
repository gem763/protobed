Facebook\u2019s critics \u2014 including 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren \u2014 have called on the company to take a more proactive approach to policing their political ads; others have suggested the company abandon running political ads altogether.\n\nFacebook chief Mark Zuckerberg weighed in earlier this month, saying he\u2019d rather let Facebook\u2019s users determine what is and isn\u2019t false in political ads, rather than the company itself.\n\n\u201cAs a principle,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a speech at Georgetown University, \u201cin a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: CNN to Launch Digital News Service to Challenge Facebook, Apple News\n\nHe added: \u201cI know many people disagree with us. But in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg later told Fox News that political ads only drive a fraction of Facebook\u2019s tens of billions in ad revenue each year, and that he\u2019d considered dropping political ads altogether. But this would do more harm than good, he argued, because it would favor incumbent politicians and the candidates news organizations decide to cover.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown also addressed the recent backlash to the publishers Facebook has included in its new News tab, most notably right-wing site Breitbart.\n\nAlso Read: Facebook Employees Tell Mark Zuckerberg: We 'Strongly Object' to Policy on Fact-Checking Political Ads\n\n\u201cI also believe that in building out a destination for news on Facebook, we should include content from ideological publishers on both the left and the right \u2013 as long as that content meets our integrity standards for misinformation,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cAll the content on Facebook News today meets those standards. If a publisher violates our standards by posting misinformation or hate speech on our platform, they will be removed from Facebook News.\u201d\n\nRead original story Facebook News Boss \u2018Astonished\u2019 Journalists Want Political Ads Fact-Checked At TheWrap", "description": "Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said Wednesday she\u2019s \u201castonished\u201d many journalists have pushed back against the company\u2019s decision to not fact-check its political ads.\u201cHaving spent most of my pre-Facebook career as a journalist covering politics, I have been astonished at the reaction", "authors": ["Sean Burch"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/027gBPhLczGOG1Qs45EhWA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/2b549c715c8e31463e045d6e09404769", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
