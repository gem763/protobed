A new approach inspired by how some spiders sense the distance to their prey could change that.\n\nJumping spiders don\u2019t have room in their tiny, hairy heads for structured light projectors and all that kind of thing. Yet they have to see where they\u2019re going and what they\u2019re grabbing in order to be effective predators. How do they do it? As is usually the case with arthropods, in a super weird but interesting way.\n\nInstead of having multiple eyes capturing a slightly different image and taking stereo cues from that, as we do, each of the spider\u2019s eyes is in itself a depth-sensing system. Each eye is multi-layered, with transparent retinas seeing the image with different amounts of blur depending on distance. The differing blurs from different eyes and layers are compared in the spider\u2019s small nervous system and produce an accurate distance measurement \u2014 using incredibly little in the way of \u201chardware.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Harvard have created a high-tech lens system that uses a similar approach, producing the ability to sense depth without traditional optical elements.\n\nThe \u201cmetalens\u201d created by electrical engineering professor Federico Capasso and his team detects an incoming image as two similar ones with different amounts of blur, like the spider\u2019s eye does. These images are compared using an algorithm also like the spider\u2019s \u2014 at least in that it is very quick and efficient \u2014 and the result is a lovely little real-time, whole-image depth calculation.\n\nThe process is not only efficient, meaning it can be done with very little computing hardware and power, but it can be extremely compact: the one used for this experiment was only 3 millimeters across.\n\nThis means it could be included not just on self-driving cars and industrial robots but on small gadgets, smart home items and, of course, phones \u2014 it probably won\u2019t replace Face ID, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThe paper describing the metalens system will be published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "description": "As robots and gadgets continue to pervade our everyday lives, they increasingly need to see in 3D \u2014 but as evidenced by the notch in your iPhone, depth-sensing cameras are still pretty bulky.
