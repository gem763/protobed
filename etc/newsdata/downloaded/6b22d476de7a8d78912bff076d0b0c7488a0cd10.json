Climbing a lofty peak didn't even cross my mind. But kids these days seem to be supremely ambitious and this 7-year-old from Hyderabad is showing the world what aiming high means.\n\nANI\n\nSamanyu Pothuraju, along with his coach, unfurled the Tricolor at a height of 5,895 meters above the sea level on April 2.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, the boy said, \"The day was rainy and the road was full of stones. I got afraid, I had leg pains, but I took rest and completed it. I like snow a lot and that is the reason I went to Mt. Kilimanjaro. Pawan Kalyan is my favourite hero, my mom promised me that she will make me meet him if I try the world record, now am eagerly waiting to meet him. I will go to Australia peak in next month ending and want to make a record.\"\n\nANI\n\nPothuraju was accompanied by his mother Lavanya, coach Thammineni Bharath, a fellow mountaineer Shangabandi Srujana, and another woman - all from Hyderabad. A local doctor from Tanzania also accompanied them.\n\nPothuraju's mother said \"I am really very happy as my son tried to achieve a world record. After reaching there, I stopped in my halfway because of my health condition but my son didn't quit unless until he reaches the destination. I was very much tensed and worried as there were different climate conditions. Our next target is Australia, 10 peaks in May ending and that will also be the record of my son.\"\n\nThe trek began on March 29 when the team started from the base point. It took almost five days for them to reach the peak.\n\nThis little bundle of joy is an inspiration for people all over the world! Way to go, Samanyu!\n\nWith inputs from ANI", "description": "7-year-old Hyderabad boy climbs Mt. Kilimanjaro 7-year-old Hyderabad boy climbs Mt. Kilimanjaro 7-year-old Hyderabad boy climbs Mt.
