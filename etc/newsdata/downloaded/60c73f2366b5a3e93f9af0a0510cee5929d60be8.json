At least 32 Kenyans were on board the Boeing 737-Max Ethiopian plane during the March 10 tragedy, which killed 157 passengers.\n\nA somber ceremony was held at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where government officials were present to console the families.\n\nIn March, the airline revealed no bodies were recovered from the site where the Boeing 737 Max, which went down minutes after take-off from the Bole International airport, crashed and only scattered remains survived the impact.\n\nThe remains were driven in hearses to different morgues around the city to allow time for burial arrangements, expected later this week.\n\nBoeing Co. has offered $100 million to local governments and non-profit organizations to help with socioeconomic development programs to help families and communities affected by the disaster in both Indonesia and Ethiopia. This is independent of the lawsuits filed in the US by families of the victims.\n\nMoreover, the company offered to pay $150,000 to the families by Dec 31 this year.\n\nSimilarities have been drawn between the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 disaster and Indonesia Lion Air Flight 610.
