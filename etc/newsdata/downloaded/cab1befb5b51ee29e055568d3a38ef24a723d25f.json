That\u2019s going to change soon, as you\u2019ll be able to switch characters, use attachments and train with your squad.\n\nAs reported by Eurogamer, developer Respawn showed off the updated training ground on a livestream on Saturday. The new training ground will be called \u201cfiring range.\u201d It looks the same, with the addition of some bright red dummies to shoot at.\n\nIt will let you switch between characters, use your tactical and ultimate abilities, and try out different weapons, armour, and hopups. The developers say you\u2019ll be able to bring your squadmates into training with you as well. It\u2019s \u201ccoming soon\u201d during season 3. You can check out some gameplay in the video below, starting at around the seven minute mark.\n\nThe developers say \u201cthere\u2019s obviously been a pretty big demand for\u201d the new firing range.
