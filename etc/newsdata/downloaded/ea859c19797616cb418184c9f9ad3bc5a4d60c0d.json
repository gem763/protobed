A retractable rear window, mounted between sleek nacelles that stretch back from behind the passengers\u2019 heads, can be opened or closed independent of the roof.\n\nChevrolet says this eighth-generation Corvette was engineered from the start with a convertible in mind, so its chassis is structurally similar to the coupe. The convertible gets just a few tweaks to its suspension and has the same aerodynamic drag as the coupe when their roofs are closed, with the \"coupe\" featuring a manually removable Targa-style roof panel.\n\nChevrolet hasn\u2019t detailed the difference in weight, but both cars use the same 6.2-liter V8, with up to 495 horsepower, and the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that goes with it.\n\nThe convertible retains a trunk behind the engine that\u2019s large enough to fit two golf bags, as well as a second compartment in the nose of the car. Pricing starts at $67,495, which represents a $7,500 premium over the coupe, and deliveries are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "The 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray has dropped its top.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
