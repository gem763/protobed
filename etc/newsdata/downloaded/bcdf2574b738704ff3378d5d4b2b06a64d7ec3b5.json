(Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)\n\nThere were few hints as this NFL season began that the Oakland Raiders would be anything but dreadful again. They were coming off a pitiable 4-12 season in Jon Gruden\u2019s return to coaching last year after leaving the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast booth. Their offseason addition of wide receiver Antonio Brown came undone amid the drama of Brown\u2019s ailing feet, helmet grievances, practice-field clash with General Manager Mike Mayock and social media antics.\n\nAny notions that the Raiders would be improved in Gruden\u2019s second season, with Brown gone and pass-rushing sensation Khalil Mack long gone after being traded before the 2018 season, seemed like delusions.\n\nAnd then came Monday night\u2019s 24-16 triumph at home over the Denver Broncos. The Raiders not only won, they won in impressive and promising fashion, with a solid performance by quarterback Derek Carr being bolstered by contributions from newcomers and youngsters. Rookie tailback Josh Jacobs looked like a legitimate centerpiece runner. Free agent addition Tyrell Williams resembled a deep-threat receiver capable of replacing Brown as the No. 1 wideout.\n\n[NFL power rankings, Week 2: Antonio Brown will make the Patriots next to unbeatable or ruin them]\n\nThings get tougher this weekend as the Raiders prepare to host the Kansas City Chiefs and the league\u2019s reigning MVP, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, in their Week 2 game Sunday. But former Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon said he already has seen enough to be convinced that this team, even after a training camp spent in front of the \u201cHard Knocks\u201d cameras followed by the chaos of Brown\u2019s exit, is progressing toward better times.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an absolute,\u201d Gannon, now an NFL analyst for CBS, said by phone this week. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t really with them all of training camp. This team got better without him. So much was made about him and everything that happened. There was \u2018Hard Knocks\u2019 and all that. And a lot of people overlooked the fact that this team got a lot better.\u201d\n\nThe victory Monday gave Gruden perhaps the first chance of his second go-round with the franchise for a told-you-so moment.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here the last couple days may have been big news to some,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cBut there were no distractions. I think you could tell that. ... Our team was ready to roll. ... I\u2019m never gonna bring it up again. That incident, whatever you call it, had nothing to do with our team\u2019s focus or preparation. That\u2019s it. End of story. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThe narrative in training camp was that the Pittsburgh Steelers, after trading Brown to the Raiders in March, would benefit from a calmer atmosphere without Brown and departed running back Le\u2019Veon Bell. It would be addition by subtraction. But few figured that would apply to the Raiders when they accommodated Brown\u2019s request last Saturday, made via Instagram, to be released, ending his tumultuous stay without him playing a single regular season game for the team.\n\n[The NFL wanted a celebration for its 100th season. Instead it got Antonio Brown.]\n\n\u201cI think a couple weeks ago, they still felt like they were gonna have him,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cBut Jon has always been able to shift gears quickly. Their top target in free agency was Tyrell Williams. They\u2019ve got a feature back. Derek Carr was really good [Monday] night. The offensive line played well. I thought they were the better, more physical team, and I think most people would agree.\u201d\n\nGruden was subjected to plenty of criticism, ridicule and derision last season after being lured back to the sideline by Raiders owner Mark Davis with a 10-year contract said to be worth $10 million per season. He traded Mack, a former NFL defensive player of the year, to Chicago, strengthening a Bears defense that carried them to the NFC North title. He traded wide receiver Amari Cooper to Dallas last October, helping the Cowboys to the NFC East crown.\n\nThe one NFL franchise not benefiting from Gruden\u2019s return to coaching, it seemed at the time, was the Raiders.\n\n\u201cIt comes with the territory,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cThere was so much made last year about Jon coming back and restoring the Raider tradition and all that. The reality was, that was a bad team. ... He\u2019s turned over the roster really quick. I know Jon\u2019s getting it where he wants it now. ... They were criticized so much for the Mack trade. But how many games would they have won last year even if they\u2019d had him? If you tie up all that money in one person, how do you address the rest of the roster?\u201d\n\nThe Raiders began this season with a dozen rookies on their roster, and 11 were active on game night against the Broncos. Thanks to the Mack and Cooper deals, the Raiders had three first-round picks in this year\u2019s NFL draft. Gruden and Mayock, the former draft analyst for the NFL Network hired by the Raiders on New Year\u2019s Eve, used those choices on defensive end Clelin Ferrell, Jacobs and safety Johnathan Abram.\n\nThe Ferrell pick at No. 4 overall was surprising and drew criticism as being a draft-night reach. But all three first-rounders had their moments Monday night. Jacobs ran for 85 yards. Ferrell had a sack. Abram was credited with five tackles and a pass breakup, although he also suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nThe Brown travails certainly weren\u2019t forgotten. But at least Gruden and the Raiders could begin to move on.\n\n\u201cAs much as people talk about it \u2014 I mean, my God,\u201d Gruden said after the game. \u201cI feel like someone is smashing my temple on the side of the head. Get over it, man. It\u2019s over. We were good the preseason without him. We\u2019re gonna be fine without him. We wish him the best. But we gave it a shot. Now New England gets their turn. Good luck to them. But I can\u2019t just deal with it any more, really. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers began their season with a lopsided defeat Sunday night at New England. They, rather than the Raiders, looked like the team that truly missed Brown in Week 1. So far, at least, it is the Raiders and not the Steelers who are making that addition-by-subtraction thing work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bigger and stronger on both sides of the line,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cThey\u2019re faster. The three draft picks, they all played well [Monday] night. I give Derek Carr and Jon Gruden a lot of credit. This team is a lot better than a year ago. I\u2019m not gonna say how many games they\u2019ll win or that they\u2019re gonna go to the playoffs or anything. But they\u2019re a lot better.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nSean Payton is moving the Saints past the NFC Championship no-call, but he hasn\u2019t forgotten\n\nESPN quickly fixed the yellow \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 graphic after viewers freaked out\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 2: Take the Dolphins and the points against the Patriots", "description": "The team seemed in disarray when Antonio Brown was released last weekend, and Coach Jon Gruden was coming off a 4-12 season.
