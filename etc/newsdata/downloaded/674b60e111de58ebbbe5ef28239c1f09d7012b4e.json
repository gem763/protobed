I\u2019m undefeated in 30 professional contests and when I go to Saudi Arabia to fight Braun Strowman, I\u2019m still going to be undefeated, because I\u2019m going to knock him out.\n\n\u2018He talks about how good his hands are, but he\u2019s messing with a guy who\u2019s got the best hands in boxing. He don\u2019t want none of them hands, let me tell you that.\u2019\n\nFury\u2019s move into wrestling is being overseen by co-promoter Bob Arum, who said: \u2018It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today at the announcement of this very, very unique event. You don\u2019t know this, but I go back a long way with WWE.\n\n\u2018In 1974 I met a then 29-year-old Vincent Kennedy McMahon and together we promoted the Evel Knievel jump over the Snake River Canyon \u2013 that was a long time ago!\n\nStrowman was sent away as Fury shadow-boxed on stage (Picture: WWE)\n\n\u2018Since then, I\u2019m so proud that Vince has built a company, WWE, that is a worldwide brand, the biggest sports and entertainment company in the world, that entertains people all over the world. It\u2019s truly remarkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And also remarkable is the lineal heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, the Gypsy King. He\u2019s not only a great fighter, but he reminds me of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. He\u2019s a consummate heavyweight, he entertains in the ring and he is a tremendous personality.\n\n\u2018He is a real showman and that\u2019s why people love him. They know he fights with his heart on his sleeve and even though he has a big cut over his eye and blood streaming down his face so he can\u2019t really see his opponent, he carries on to victory.\u2019", "description": "Things got a little heated on stage as former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury announced he will take on Braun Strowman at a WWE event in Saudi Arabia on October...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Triple-H-Tyson-Fury-e9d0_1570829348.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
