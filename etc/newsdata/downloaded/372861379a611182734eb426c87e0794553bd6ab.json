Then the Right-Wing Spin Machine Turned the Story Upside Down.", "language": "en", "text": "The truth behind that story has been lost in a swamp of right-wing opposition research, White House lies, and bizarre follow-up stories. Now it appears that the Biden-Ukraine story will play a role in a new impeachment inquiry against Trump, amid evidence that he sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding U.S. aid unless Zelensky agreed to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn 2015, I wrote a story for the New York Times about Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Ukraine. Many observers now seem to think this suddenly hot story came out of nowhere this year, but that is not true.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to see my journalism twisted, perverted, and turned into lies and poisonous propaganda by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and their enablers. But that\u2019s what has happened to a news story I wrote four years ago.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released a summary of the July conversation between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump told the Ukrainian leader to work with Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani to find out what happened between the Bidens and a Ukrainian prosecutor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to the summary. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House will launch an impeachment investigation, and the whistleblower who complained about the Trump-Zelensky call to the intelligence community inspector general is seeking to testify before Congress. Thus, just months after the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, Congress will investigate whether Trump sought to pressure another foreign leader to help him win the 2020 presidential race.\n\nWith so much now at stake, I thought it would be useful to revisit my original story and in the process, separate the truth from the gathering lies.\n\nIn December 2015, I was an investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of the Times. That month, I published a story reporting that Vice President Joe Biden had just traveled to Ukraine, in part to send a message to the Ukrainian government that it needed to crack down on corruption.\n\nBut I also wrote that his anti-corruption message might be undermined by the association of his son Hunter with one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies, Burisma Holdings, and with its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky had been Ukraine\u2019s ecology minister under former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian leader who had been forced into exile in Russia.\n\nHunter Biden had joined the board of Burisma in April 2014, the same month that British officials froze Zlochevsky\u2019s London bank accounts containing $23 million. Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office, an independent government agency, was conducting a money-laundering investigation and refused to allow Zlochevsky or Burisma Holdings, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, and another company owned by Zlochevsky access to the accounts.\n\nBut the British money-laundering investigation was stymied by Ukrainian prosecutors\u2019 refusal to cooperate. The Ukrainian prosecutors would not turn over documents needed in the British investigation, and without that documentary evidence, a British court ordered Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office to unfreeze the assets.\n\nIn September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt gave a speech in which he attacked the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office for failing to cooperate with the British investigation. In his speech \u2014 which I quoted in my story \u2014 Pyatt mentioned Burisma\u2019s owner by name.\n\n\u201cIn the case of former Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky, the U.K. authorities had seized $23 million in illicit assets that belonged to the Ukrainian people,\u201d Pyatt said. Officials at the prosecutor general\u2019s office, he added, were asked by the United Kingdom \u201cto send documents supporting the seizure. Instead they sent letters to Zlochevsky\u2019s attorneys attesting that there was no case against him. As a result, the money was freed by the U.K. court, and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus.\u201d\n\nWhen Joe Biden arrived in Ukraine in December 2015 to press for more aggressive anti-corruption efforts by the government, Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma made his father\u2019s demands, however well-intentioned, appear politically awkward and hypocritical. That was the point of my story. I quoted Edward C. Chow, who follows Ukrainian policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who said the involvement of the vice president\u2019s son with Zlochevsky\u2019s firm undermined the Obama administration\u2019s anti-corruption message in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNow you look at the Hunter Biden situation, and on the one hand you can credit the father for sending the anticorruption message,\u201d Chow said. \u201cBut I think unfortunately it sends the message that a lot of foreign countries want to believe about America, that we are hypocritical about these issues.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Hunter Biden has been the black sheep of the Biden family for years. He was the younger son who could never live up to the example set by his older brother, Beau, an Iraq war veteran and the attorney general of Delaware who died of brain cancer in 2015, cutting short a promising political career.\n\nIn 2014, Hunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine use. He had also been involved in a hedge fund with his uncle, James Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s brother, that went bad in the face of lawsuits involving the Bidens and a business partner.\n\nHunter Biden was the family millstone around Joe Biden\u2019s neck, the kind of chronic problem relative that plagues many political families. George H.W. Bush had his son Neil; Jimmy Carter had his brother Billy.\n\nStill, when Joe Biden went to Ukraine, he was not trying to protect his son \u2014 quite the reverse.", "description": "Many observers now seem to think this suddenly hot story came out of nowhere this year, but that is not true.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/09/AP_16230546670169-biden-1569385152-e1569385275797.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
