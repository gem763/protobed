It wasn\u2019t.", "language": "en", "text": "Nor will many Americans regret our military\u2019s role in ending the Islamic State\u2019s rule or its leader\u2019s life. The effort to defeat the terrorist group started under President Barack Obama and has received the support of virtually all political leaders. One may differ over specific tactics employed in the battle, but there was no dispute between our increasingly polarized parties that we should utterly destroy the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement of Bagdhadi\u2019s demise, however, detracted from the national victory. His halting delivery, seemingly unable to complete short sentences without pausing, shows how uncomfortable the president is with words. Compare Trump\u2019s speech with Obama\u2019s announcement of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. Obama\u2019s speech flowed freely and had a reassuring tone. Trump\u2019s, to put it gently, did not.\n\nTrump\u2019s insistence on using graphic, brutal language also separates the two men. One can sense how much Trump was moved by the agony of Baghdadi\u2019s final minutes and how he relished seeing a hate-filled man driven by the fear he caused in so many others. That emotion \u2014 the sense that justice was delivered \u2014 is only human. That does not mean the president of the United States ought to display those feelings to the entire world.\n\nIt is one thing to be told that Bagdhadi died fleeing justice and murdered his own children rather than be captured. It is quite another to be told repeatedly that he \u201cwas whimpering,\u201d was \u201ca coward\u201d and that he \u201cdied like a dog.\u201d The president should be above such obvious glee at his enemy\u2019s defeat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are surely many Republicans who will disagree. They will delight in his coarse language and his stark description of a terrorist who felt terror at his end. They will tell us that this is another example of Trump\u2019s virtue \u2014 that he fights and tells it like it is. For many, this blunt talk is a source of his appeal.\n\nBut others believe that the United States is a moral nation and that it ought to display all of its virtues precisely at moments like these where might makes right. Our president should not shirk from talking about what an evil man did, nor should he display faux moral equivalence when discussing the death of a gangster. But neither should he wallow in the gutter, even for a moment, exulting like a vicious animal celebrating its kill. That\u2019s not what America is about \u2014 at least, it shouldn\u2019t be what we are about.\n\nOne can be a fighter without being a thug. Winston Churchill was a ferocious fighter \u2014 someone who stood up to Adolf Hitler when even his predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, seemed afraid. Churchill did not shirk from telling the truth about the vile and vicious Nazi regime that Hitler built. But one cannot imagine Churchill publicly celebrating Hitler\u2019s suicide with glee. He would never announce to Britons that Hitler had \u201cdied like a dog\u201d in the F\u00fchrerbunker. Churchill famously said \u201cin victory, magnanimity,\u201d because it was precisely by displaying greatness of soul when one can display barbaric vengeance that one shows the victor\u2019s moral superiority over the vanquished. One longs for a wisp of the Churchillian in Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are many Americans who support the bulk of Trump\u2019s policies but shudder about supporting him. Some vote for him while others demur. If Trump were ever to grasp that his own lack of restraint pushes away people who might be his friends, he would become the odds-on favorite for reelection. Instead, we have what we saw Sunday morning: a man capable of great will and decisiveness who nonetheless brings himself down through the smallness of his soul.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump should take a lesson from Winston Churchill to show magnanimity in victory.", "authors": ["Henry Olsen", "Columnist Focusing On Politics", "Populism", "American Conservative Thought"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/altPr0A7Mk9OdNioUwwhMqQ2NSw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTLP5LHZHAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
