The six-year-old was beaten just a length into second by Cross Counter in last year\u2019s running, and was among the leading hopes again for the two-mile prize after winning a Deauville Group Two contest in August.\n\n\n\nHowever, he was ordered to undergo a scan at the start of this week after Racing Victoria vets found him to be sore \u2013 and that test has revealed two \u201cincomplete fractures\u201d in both a fore and hind leg.\n\nTalking Horses: Appleby banks on Old Persian for shot at Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Read more\n\nThe stewards duly ordered his withdrawal on Wednesday, along with the Charlie Appleby-trained Ispolini, who also underwent a scan which \u201cindicated pre-fracture pathology within the horse\u2019s right front cannon bone\u201d.\n\nThe East Isley trainer, who arrived in Australia on Tuesday to supervise Marmelo\u2019s build-up, was quick to signal his intention to appeal, describing the stewards\u2019 views about the scan as \u201cinaccurate and unfounded\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m trying to sort an appeal out. It\u2019s not only me this has happened to.\u201d\n\n\n\nA statement on http://www.racingvictoria.com.au read: \u201c[The] stewards received a [Racing Victoria] veterinary report advising that Marmelo would not be fit to compete in the Melbourne Cup if it was held on the day of final acceptances [on Saturday]. Marmelo was referred to the University of Melbourne equine clinic to undergo a scan across the weekend after showing signs of soreness upon inspection by veterinarians.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe results of the standing CT scan indicated an incomplete fracture in the horse\u2019s near fore cannon bone and an incomplete fracture in its off hind cannon bone. Having considered the veterinary report, in addition to veterinary reports submitted by trainer Hughie Morrison, stewards acting under AR20(d) have ordered the withdrawal of the horse from the Melbourne Cup. [The] stewards made their decision to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Marmelo, along with his potential competitors and riders.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal of Marmelo leaves leading jockey Hugh Bowman without a ride in the Melbourne Cup.\n\n\n\nIspolini\u2019s absence is a further blow for Godolphin after Saeed bin-Suroor\u2019s Cup outsider Red Galileo was ruled out and referred to the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital at Werribee for scans \u2013 having pulled up lame after a gallop. The owner will now rely upon Appleby\u2019s Cross Counter, who is set to shoulder top weight following his 2018 victory.", "description": "Hughie Morrison is planning to appeal against the decision of the Racing Victoria stewards to rule Marmelo out of next week\u2019s Melbourne Cup", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d334f20576c666d1bcb8e032ec6e1f1b6af223/0_247_5162_3098/master/5162.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00abb9a87db7ff3e2c0f118e95489fda", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
