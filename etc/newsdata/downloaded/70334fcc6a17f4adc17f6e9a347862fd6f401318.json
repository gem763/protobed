Francis will be in Thailand on Nov. 20-23 before heading to Japan, where government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the pope would meet with the emperor and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nIt will be Francis\u2019 fourth trip to Asia, where he has already visited South Korea, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Myanmar and Bangladesh.\n\nThe last pope to visit Japan was the late Saint Pope John Paul II in 1981. He was also the last pope to visit Thailand, in 1984.\n\nDuring his official visit to Thailand, Francis will preside at religious ceremonies and make pastoral visits to Catholic communities.\n\nFrancis\u2019s Japan visit includes Tokyo as well as Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which were hit by U.S. atomic bombs at the end of World War II. A call for a world without nuclear weapons has been Francis\u2019 longtime message.\n\nNagasaki Archbishop Joseph Mitsuaki Takami, who heads the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Japan, expressed gratitude to Francis, noting he and others in the Japanese church have been asking for his visit for years.\n\nHe acknowledged that Japan does not have as many Christians as some other nations. But he said Francis had special feelings for Japan, referring to how last year the pope had the Vatican print up thousands of cards of a Nagasaki nuclear bombing child survivor carrying his dead brother on his back. The card had the words \u201cThe fruit of war\u201d printed on it.\n\n\u201cI think the pope was laying the groundwork for this visit,\u201d the archbishop said in a statement.\n\nHaving the pope in Nagasaki will also highlight the legacy of Christian missionaries dating back to the samurai era, including 26 martyrs killed in 1597. It will help honor the so-called \u201cHidden Christians,\u201d who kept the faith alive during decades of persecution.\n\nJapan, whose main religions are Buddhism and Shintoism, has about 441,000 Catholics, many in Nagasaki, comprising fewer than 1% of the overall population. Thailand, with an overall population of 69 million people, has some 388,000 Catholics.\n\nIn a 2017 speech at a disarmament conference at the Vatican, Francis signaled a shift in church teaching about nuclear deterrence, warning that the Cold War-era strategy of deterrence was no longer viable and urging instead complete nuclear disarmament.\n\n\u201cIf we \u2026 take into account the risk of an accidental detonation as a result of error of any kind, the threat of (nuclear weapons\u2019) use, as well as their very possession, is to be firmly condemned,\u201d he said.\n\nPrevious popes including St. John Paul II had called for the abolition of nuclear weapons but said the stockpiling of them could be morally acceptable as a form of deterrence.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nicole Winfield at the Vatican and Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pope Francis will visit Thailand and Japan in November in a visit expected to highlight his call for complete nuclear disarmament and honor the small Catholic communities in each country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nannapat Purod"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/asia_pope_62855_c0-0-3500-2040_s1770x1032.jpg?b0161dc565e13cabf46548a71443391c628067cb", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
