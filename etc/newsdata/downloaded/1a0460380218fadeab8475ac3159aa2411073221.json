Five men of Mexican origin claimed that Trump security personnel, including his longtime aide Keith Schiller, assaulted them and wrestled away their signs in a bid to break up the protest.\n\nA judge rejected an early bid to force Trump to testify in the case, but last Friday, the latest judge assigned to the suit ruled that Trump\u2019s testimony was needed for the trial.\n\nBronx Supreme Court Justice Doris Gonzalez said legal precedent required her to uphold the subpoena for a sworn account by Trump of his control over the personnel who engaged in the fracas.\n\n\u201cMore than 200 years ago our founders sought to escape an oppressive, tyrannical governance in which absolute power vested with a monarch. A fear of the recurrence of tyranny birthed our three-branch government adorned with checks and balances,\u201d Gonzalez wrote in her ruling. \u201cNo government official, including the Executive, is above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s defense against the protesters\u2019 suit was being handled by Lawrence Rosen from the Manhattan-based firm LaRocca, Hornik, Rosen and Greenberg. However, another longtime lawyer for Trump, Marc Kasowitz of Manhattan-based Kasowitz, Benson, Torres jumped in Tuesday to handle the urgent appeal.\n\nTrump\u2019s main argument against the deposition is that state court judges lack the legal authority to force a sitting president to testify and may not show the proper deference to a president\u2019s other critical duties.", "description": "The suit is related to a protest outside Trump Tower in 2015.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e2/f6/e57546c946508cac490cce54ce56/190619-trump-tower-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
