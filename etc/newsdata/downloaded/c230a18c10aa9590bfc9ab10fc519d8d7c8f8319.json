But they probably still consider him a heathen. Photo: Olivier Douliery - Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe symbol of Donald Trump\u2019s defiant attitude and undignified threats in the face of impeachment proceedings is presently a tweet in which he quoted conservative Evangelical leader (and huge Trump ally) Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, to the effect that we\u2019d experience violence if the godless socialistic Democrats get their way:\n\n....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe tweet led at least one Republican congressman to rebuke the president for fomenting insurrection by quoting Jeffress:\n\nI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant. https://t.co/a5Bae7bP7g \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) September 30, 2019\n\nI think the idea that Trump is recklessly repeating careless words from a Bible-thumping extremist misses some underlying issues here.\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi rather abruptly climbed aboard the Impeachment Express last week, Trump\u2019s natural instinct would have been to make damn sure his Republican and conservative flanks were covered, ensuring that impeachment would be perceived as a partisan exercise by the Democratic House that would quickly die in the Republican Senate. Where might he fear defections? Definitely from Never Trump Republicans; but they have far fewer troops in Congress than in op-ed columns. Next in line as possible apostates in this particular situation would be the Christian right. Why? Because removal of Trump from office would elevate their favorite pol and Trump-whisperer, Mike Pence, and give the Christian right a lengthy and stable hold on power (if elevated by Trump\u2019s removal from office, Pence could run as an incumbent not only in 2020 but in 2024). And after all, for all of his faithful execution of his transactional relationship with these folks since his election as president, Trump remains a man whom Southern Baptist spokesman Russell Moore accurately described as someone with a \u201cBronze Age warlord\u2019s\u201d attitude toward women and no credible evidence of belief in the gospel of the Prince of Peace.\n\nSo in going nuts over the impeachment proceedings, the president may have implicitly signaled that he needs a fresh bending of the knee from the constituency that was so critical to his election and reelection \u2014 but that also has the most to gain from Trump\u2019s removal from office. That\u2019s what Jeffress supplied.\n\nIn their hearts, there\u2019s not much doubt that conservative Evangelical leaders would be happy and relieved if Trump could be removed from office without the Republican Party losing control of the White House \u2014 particularly if the new inhabitant of said house was their lil\u2019 darling. But the paranoid POTUS knows that, which is almost certainly why he\u2019s eagerly accepting protestations like the one offered by Jeffress. Before long, every conservative opinion leader in America will be expected to pledge unconditional allegiance to the caudillo of Mar-a-Lago. The more suspect they are, the louder their protestations of loyalty will be. Even if it requires a choosing of sides in a hypothetical civil war.", "description": "In praising Robert Jeffress\u2019s warning about impeachment causing a civil war, Trump may be asking for \u2014 and obtaining \u2014 a pledge of allegiance from a constituency that would love to see Mike Pence become president.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/09/09-trump-robert-jeffress.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
