This process, however, could take months to unfold.\n\nBut at least for now, the U.S.-China trade situation remains about as fluid as it had been before the inquiry announcement. Friday morning, CNBC reported that high-level trade talks between the U.S. and China were set to take place in Washington, D.C. on October 10 and 11, corroborating previous reports that the next round of discussions would take place mid-October.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nEarlier this week, stocks had risen after Trump said at the UN in New York that a deal could come \u201csooner than you think,\u201d and fell following a Bloomberg report Thursday that the Trump administration was not planning on renewing waivers allowing U.S. companies to sell to China\u2019s Huawei.\n\nMicron Technologies (MU), an Idaho-based chipmaker that counts Huawei as a customer, on Thursday cited the trade war as a significant challenge for the business, which derives more than 80% of its revenue from international sources. Shares of Micron declined overnight after it delivered disappointing earnings guidance, despite posting estimates-beating results for the reported quarter.\n\n\u201cWe see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations,\u201d Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said during a call with analysts. \u201cIf the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to Huawei over the coming quarters.\u201d\n\nDuring the reported quarter, Micron had shipped some products to Huawei that the company deemed not subject to the Trump administration\u2019s Entity List restrictions. However, shipments to Huawei still declined quarter-over-quarter, \u201cand were down meaningfully from the levels [the company] anticipated prior to the addition of Huawei to the Entity List,\u201d Mehrotra said.\n\nECONOMY: Core inflation remained muted in August\n\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred metric to track underlying inflation, rose at a slower-than-expected pace in August, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday.\n\nCore PCE increased 0.1% in August over the month prior, versus a gain of 0.2% expected by consensus economists and posted in July. Over last year, core PCE rose 1.8%, as expected, from an upwardly revised 1.7% gain in July.\n\nPCE tracks price changes for goods and services, with the core metric excluding fluctuations for the typically volatile food and energy categories.\n\nHeadline PCE was flat for the month of August, versus an increase of 0.1% expected. This was down from an increase of 0.2% in July. Over last year, headline PCE rose an expected 1.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer spending slowed in August while incomes rose, the BEA said in a separate report Friday. Personal income increased an expected 0.4% over the month prior, versus a gain of 0.1% in July. Personal spending rose just 0.1%, versus a gain of 0.3% expected. For July, personal spending was downwardly revised to see an increase of 0.5%, from an increase of 0.6% reported previously.", "description": "U.S. stocks were mixed at the end of a tumultuous week of political and trade-related developments, which have added further doses of uncertainty for market participants to monitor.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EmF2uKO64uzgpDjSYWiPRQ--~B/aD0zNzY3O3c9NTY1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/14593260-e11a-11e9-af8d-5ed31a9c0587", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
