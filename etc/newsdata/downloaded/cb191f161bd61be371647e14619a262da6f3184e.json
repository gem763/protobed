In fact, she wouldn\u2019t mind it at all.\n\nMackenzie Dern has built up a reputation as a fighter who consistently struggles when she steps on the scale. However, on Thursday, the American claimed she is just one pound away from hitting the mark.\n\nOn the main card of UFC on ESPN+ 19, Ribas (7-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC) and Dern (7-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) are set to meet in a 115-pound matchup. The event takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. and streams on ESPN+.\n\n\u201cIt (doesn\u2019t make) a difference, because I need to be worried about my weight,\u201d Ribas told MMA Junkie. \u201cIf she does not make the weight, it\u2019s good for me. Thirty percent. But I\u2019m not worried about this.\u201d\n\nIn her promotional debut in June, Ribas submitted Emily Whitmire by second-round rear-naked choke. Her last four fights have ended inside the distance.\n\nHer opponent, Arizona\u2019s Dern, will return to action for the first time since giving birth to her first child in June. The Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt has four victories by submission.\n\nTo hear more from Amanda Ribas at UFC on ESPN+ 19 media day, watch the video above.", "description": "Amanda Ribas isn't worried about her UFC on ESPN+ 19 opponent missing weight at Friday's weigh-ins.
