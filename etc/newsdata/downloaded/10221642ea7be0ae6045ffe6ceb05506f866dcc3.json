The viral video app was downloaded over 1 billion times globally last year, surpassing both Facebook and Instagram in the number of installs, according to analytics site Sensor Tower.\n\nTikTok has said it follows the same content moderation guidelines as other apps in the U.S., but it has not disclosed how it regulates its content, CNET senior producer Dan Patterson told CBSN. \"There's a lot of opacity as to what they are filtering and how they are filtering it,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Patterson, TikTok must adhere to the same censorship laws governing other Chinese social media companies, like WeChat or Baidu.\n\nTikTok reigns as most-downloaded app, passing Facebook, Instagram\n\nIt's not the first time a wildly popular app from a country other than the U.S. has sparked privacy concerns. When Russian-owned FaceApp went viral this summer, it raised concerns that people using filters to alter their faces to look older were effectively handing their photos to the company, which can be used to further train FaceApp's machine-learning software.\n\nThat raises similar concerns that TikTok parent ByteDance, the largest startup in the world with a valuation of $75 billion, can use its immense capital and vast amounts of harvested data to apply artificial intelligence at large scales, according to Patterson.\n\n\"When we think about privacy and we think about security, we have to think also about capability,\" Patterson said.\n\nHe added: \"They are certainly doing interesting things with your face data and artificial intelligence.\"", "description": "A search for Hong Kong demonstrations on Facebook or Twitter yields thousands of results \u2014 not so on Chinese-owned app", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/10/3988a8a3-5a22-4882-afcd-1e88edab7af4/thumbnail/1200x630/63cd26e96148d6e46f1e47ba7657acba/gettyimages-1073256686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
