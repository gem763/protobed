That moves puts the Texans firmly in win-now mode and should aid what appears to be a rebuilding process in Miami.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Seahawks fortified their defensive front and took advantage of the Texans\u2019 curious handling of Clowney\u2019s contract standoff. That trade sent Clowney, the three-time Pro Bowl defensive end and former top overall selection in the NFL draft, to Seattle for two players and a third-round draft pick next spring.\n\nThe trade agreements were confirmed by people familiar with the deliberations. The deals came with NFL teams facing Saturday\u2019s 4 p.m. ET deadline to reduce their rosters to 53 players for the regular season.\n\nThe Texans are operating without a permanent general manager after firing Brian Gaine in June and being rebuffed in their reported effort to lure highly regarded front-office executive Nick Caserio from the New England Patriots. The absence of a permanent GM has increased Coach Bill O\u2019Brien\u2019s authority in shaping the team\u2019s roster. But there was room to wonder Saturday whether the Texans had given up too much for Tunsil and Stills and gotten too little in return for Clowney.\n\nThe addition of Tunsil gives the Texans a reliable left tackle. Stills is coming off a 37-catch, 553-yard season. He also drew attention recently for being publicly critical of Dolphins owner Stephen Ross once Ross agreed to hold a fundraiser for President Trump. Stills, one of the relatively small number of NFL players who continued to protest during the national anthem last season, said that was inconsistent with Ross having a foundation formed to use sports to improve race relations.\n\nBut the Texans are paying plenty: their next two first-round picks and a second-rounder in 2021. And the Dolphins are stockpiling draft choices. They now have four first-rounders and four second-rounders in the next two NFL drafts. In this trade, the Texans also receive fourth- and sixth-round draft choices from the Dolphins, while Miami adds two Texans players, offensive tackle Julie\u2019n Davenport and cornerback Johnson Bademosi.\n\nIn addition to the third-round draft choice, the Texans receive defensive end and linebacker Barkevious Mingo and linebacker Jacob Martin in the Clowney trade. Clowney, the No. 1 choice in the 2014 NFL draft by the Texans out of South Carolina, had refused to sign his franchise deal and report to Houston. The one-year deal is worth $15.967 million for Clowney.\n\nThe Texans had been exploring trade options for Clowney, and the Dolphins and Philadelphia Eagles also were speculated to be in the mix. Clowney reportedly did not want to play for the Dolphins and had some control over the situation because he had to sign his franchise deal to be traded, under NFL rules. He also reportedly had been willing to report recently to the Texans and play this season under his franchise player deal but changed his mind after learning of the possibility that he\u2019d be traded.\n\nMingo is a former first-round draft pick who had one sack last season for the Seahawks and has 10 sacks in his six NFL seasons. He\u2019s joining his fifth NFL team after stints in Cleveland, New England, Indianapolis and Seattle. Martin is a second-year player who had three sacks and nine tackles for the Seahawks last season as a rookie after being drafted in the sixth round out of Temple.\n\nBy failing to trade Clowney before the July 15 deadline for NFL teams to sign franchise-tagged players to long-term deals, the Texans limited his value on the trade market. Any team trading for him would be adding a player eligible for unrestricted free agency next spring, without the ability to immediately sign Clowney to a multi-year contract extension.\n\nWhen the Seahawks, in contrast, traded their franchise-tagged defensive end, Frank Clark, to the Kansas City Chiefs in April, they received first- and second-round draft picks. Those two teams also exchanged third-round choices and Clark was signed to a lucrative new contract by the Chiefs.\n\nSo the Seahawks essentially are adding Clowney as a replacement for Clark in their formidable defensive front seven, in what amounts to a masterful move by General Manager John Schneider and Coach Pete Carroll. The Seahawks potentially could recoup the draft choice they surrendered for Clowney, in the form of a compensatory draft pick next year if he leaves in free agency after one season.\n\nClowney totaled 18 1/2 sacks over the past two seasons but has not developed into the dominant pass rusher he projected to be when he was drafted. But he has become a superb all-around defender who has been selected to the past three Pro Bowls.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nBills reportedly to release LeSean McCoy as NFL cutdown day shifts into high gear\n\nEzekiel Elliott could miss multiple regular season games, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says\n\nNFL power rankings, Week 1: Patriots No. 1 until proved otherwise; Andrew Luck-less Colts drop\n\n2019 NFL predictions: Division, wild card and Super Bowl pick", "description": "Houston agreed to a pair of blockbuster trades Saturday, including one that will send defensive end Jadeveon Clowney to the Seattle Seahawks.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LLQXD6GMHUI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
