(AP) - Lynn Bowden accounted for three touchdowns in his first start at quarterback, including the go-ahead 24-yard scoring run with 6:53 remaining, to rally Kentucky past Arkansas 24-20 on Saturday night and end a three-game losing streak.\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 top receiver took first-team snaps during the bye while banged-up Sawyer Smith recovered and was announced as the starter before the game. The junior led Kentucky (3-3, 1-3 Southeastern Conference) back from a sluggish offensive start with a 3-yard run late in the first half before eventually seizing the lead with a 10-yard TD pass to Clevan Thomas late in the third.\n\nBowden then directed a 75-yard drive ending with his second TD run and sealed the close victory with a 51-yard run in the final minutes. He finished with a career-best 196 yards rushing on 24 carries and completed 7 of 11 passes for 78 yards.\n\nA.J. Rose added 90 yards rushing on 16 carries as the Wildcats outrushed the Razorbacks (2-4, 0-3) 330-183 and outgained them 418-305 overall.\n\nRakeem Boyd rushed for 134 yards and two touchdowns, including a 74-yard TD run on the game\u2019s second play, as Arkansas took a 13-0 lead. His 2-yard TD put the Razorbacks ahead 20-17 but they ended up losing their 14th consecutive SEC game and third close contest in a row.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks got the start they needed with Boyd\u2019s TD run on the game\u2019s second play and Connor Limpert\u2019s field goals of 28 and 44 yards. The offense stalled from there, Ben Hicks replaced Nick Starkel and ended up leading a go-ahead TD drive, but the defense struggled to contain the quick and versatile Bowden.\n\nKentucky: After coyly avoiding answering whether Bowden would start ahead of Smith, coach Mark Stoops went with the versatile receiver. The Wildcats\u2019 execution struggled at times, but Bowden provided the needed spark. The defense also made several big plays late to preserve the homecoming win.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas hosts No. 12 Auburn on Saturday.\n\nKentucky visits No. 3 Georgia on Saturday, seeking to end a nine-game losing streak against the Bulldogs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lynn Bowden accounted for three touchdowns in his first start at quarterback, including the go-ahead 24-yard scoring run with 6:53 remaining, to rally Kentucky past Arkansas 24-20 on Saturday night and end a three-game losing streak.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary B.
