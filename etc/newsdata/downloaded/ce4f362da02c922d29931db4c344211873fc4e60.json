Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were murdered. This was a genocide \u2014and it\u2019s important that we call this crime what it was.\"\n\nTurkey has long disputed the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe what happened, calling the death toll inflated and considering those killed victims of war.\n\nEarlier this year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said nations accusing his country of committing genocide had their own \u201cbloody past.\u201d\n\nResolutions by the U.S. to recognize the Armenian genocide have been introduced multiple times in recent decades but have never reached the floor. Such instances occurred separately under the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations.\n\nOpponents of a resolution say formally recognizing the Armenian genocide risks angering Turkey, whose relationship is crucial to stability in the region. But such apprehensiveness has waned with Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeast Syria earlier this month following President Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region.\n\n\u201cI think some of us are a little bit annoyed with Turkey, and we want them to know how much annoyed we are,\u201d Engel told NPR last week.\n\nESPER DEFENDS U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM NORTHERN SYRIA AS TRUMP DECRIES \u2018ENDLESS WARS,\u2019 TOUTS SANCTIONS ON TURKEY\n\nH.Res.296 is a bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and GOP Reps.
