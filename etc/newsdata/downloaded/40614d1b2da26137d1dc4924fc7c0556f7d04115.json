But he couldn\u2019t have imagined the type of start his team had.\n\nThe Avalanche scored three goals on their first three shots, causing Washington to pull Braden Holtby eight minutes into the game, and went on to serve the Capitals a 6-3 drubbing.\n\nCapitals backup goalie Ilya Samsonov made his first regular season appearance at home, playing 52 minutes in relief but allowed two goals, including a power-play goal.\n\nThe Capitals fell to 3-2-2 while the Avalanche remained perfect at 5-0-0.\n\nWashington nearly put together a late comeback, with Alex Ovechkin rifling in his fifth goal of the season late in the third period to make it 5-3 and John Carlson nearly adding a top-shelf goal 15 seconds later. The shot in question went in, but the Avalanche successfully challenged that T.J. Oshie skated offsides in the leadup to the play.\n\nHoltby entered Monday with an .868 save percentage. By his failing to make a save on three shots, that percentage sank to .846.\n\nFurther, the first two goals he allowed came from defensemen. Erik Johnson fired the opening goal from just in front of the blue line, with former Capital Andre Burakovsky screening Holtby. When Carlson lost possession of the puck at Washington\u2019s blue line a few minutes later, the Avalanche scored in transition by setting up an easy shot for Nikita Zadorov to spin through the slot and score.\n\nOnce Nazem Kadri made it 3-0 just 7:54 into the period, Holtby\u2019s day was done \u2014 the shortest outing of his career.\n\nMikko Rantanen scored a power-play goal on Samsonov before the 10-minute mark to help Colorado pour it on, but the Capitals came out playing much more physically in the second period and mounted the beginnings of a comeback.\n\nSeveral minutes into the second, Ovechkin made a quick-instinct play to set up Washington\u2019s first goal. He got his stick in front of an Avalanche D-zone pass, and Eller collected the puck and skated in on Grubauer for the goal.\n\nOshie cut it to 4-2 with a backhand goal before the middle frame was out. Colorado\u2019s defenders lost track of Oshie as the Capitals set up in their zone, and Dmitry Orlov fed him in front of the net.\n\nIn the third, Samsonov went behind the net to collect a puck, not knowing that Colorado center Tyson Jost was sprinting into the area. Samsonov turned it over, Jost\u2019s pass to the net squirted through his legs and Matt Nieto dove to punch it in.\n\nAfter a hectic final few minutes, Nathan MacKinnon added Colorado\u2019s sixth goal on an empty net.\n\nCapitals defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler left the game after star Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon collided into him.\n\nThe Capitals have two more games in their current homestand, Wednesday against the Maple Leafs and Friday against the Rangers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
