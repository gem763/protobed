USA TODAY\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Tua Tagovailoa is expected to return to practice Wednesday, though Alabama head coach Nick Saban isn't ready to say whether that means his Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback will be healthy enough to play in next weekend's much-publicized game against No. 2 LSU.\n\n\"We'll just have to see what he can do and evaluate his mobility and his performance. You can't really predict any of those things, you've just got to let it happen and see how it goes,\" Saban said prior to his annual appearance at the Monday Morning Quarterback Club of Birmingham. \"I think Wednesday will probably be the first day he's back on the field. He's been on an AlterG (treadmill) now and progressing well on that, which is usually the protocol for how we bring players back that have lower extremity-type injuries.\"\n\nWednesday will be exactly 10 days since Tagovailoa underwent a TightRope surgical procedure on his right ankle to repair a severe high ankle sprain suffered midway though the second quarter against Tennessee. It\u2019s the second time in the last 10 months that Tagovailoa has gone through such a process, the first of which saw him play against Oklahoma in last season\u2019s College Football Playoff national semifinal 27 days after undergoing a similar procedure to his left ankle last December.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa watches from the sideline during the game against Arkansas.

The next step for Tagovailoa will be showing agility and lateral movement on the injured ankle.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty of that process, Saban isn't making any sweeping declarations regarding his quarterback's availability for No. 1 Alabama's next game Nov. 9 against LSU (8-0, 5-0 SEC).\n\n\"I've got no crystal ball, I don't know how he's going to do in Wednesday's practice,\" Saban said after being asked if there was optimism Tagovailoa will be able to play against LSU. \"I don't know how he'll do after that. So is it fair to say I don't know? Well, I don't know. Nobody knows.\"\n\nNCAA Re-Rank 1-130: Oklahoma falls to No. 9 and the American Athletic shows strength\n\nTony Dorsett vs. Barry Sanders: Who is college football's all-time greatest?\n\nSaban also made it clear he has no timetable or set conditions for Tagovailoa's return to the field, even if that means missing the LSU game.\n\n\"If he can perform, he'll be able to play,\" Saban said flatly. \"If he can't perform, then he won't play.\"", "description": "Nick Saban said Alabama will have to see how Tua Tagovailoa performs in his expected return to practice before determining if he can go against LSU.", "authors": ["Alex Byington", "Published P.M.
