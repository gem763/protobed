A golfer in his own right, Ferguson had previously worked to start a golf club on Howard\u2019s campus in lieu of a sanctioned Division 1 team.\n\n\u201cOtis [and I] connected on golf,\u201d Curry said, referencing a chance encounter the two had when Curry visited Howard\u2019s campus in 2015.\n\nHe went on to say that both he and Ferguson appreciate the life lessons golf has taught them, including the values of \u201caccountability, competition, [and] discipline.\u201d\n\n3rd-gen Bison legacy student Otis Ferguson IV was working to restore a golf club at HU when attended a panel on campus a few months ago w/ @StephenCurry30.\n\n\n\nKnowing Curry loves golf, Otis asked him to play & Curry took him up on that offer AND decided to fund an HU golf program! pic.twitter.com/1VPnJMhSQ6 \u2014 Howard University (@HowardU) August 19, 2019\n\nMany may have become aware of the Golden State Warrior\u2019s affinity only after seeing him share the links with his most famous golf partner, former President Barack Obama. But the star guard has credited his father for introducing him to the game at a young age.\n\nThe program will not only function to share the game Curry loves. During Monday\u2019s press conference, Howard University president Wayne Frederick suggested the initiative will be doing a service in changing the long-held perceptions about golf being a white sport. The world of golf has traditionally been a homogenous one, as many courses and country clubs were historically made available only to white men.\n\n\u201cThere is no field in this country that Howard University doesn\u2019t diversify,\u201d Frederick said.\n\nCurry\u2019s donation will reportedly fund the program for the next six years, granting university officials time to create a self-sufficient golf program at one of the nation\u2019s most storied historically Black universities.", "description": "In a Monday press conference, Curry credited a former Howard student for urging him to revitalize the long-shuttered program.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5adee0250000330017e4d3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
