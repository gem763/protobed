I think if you're progressing and happy where you are, if you're striving in your job and have a nice place to live and you've reached some milestones that make you feel like you're achieving more and you're more grown up that's what matters.\n\n\"It can be a little daunting when you get into your 30s and then leave them and go into your 40s and then into your 50s, but if you're feeling good then you're winning really.\"\n\nLisa also said a good support network of friends and family is key to confidence.\n\nAnd it sounds like she's won the lottery when it comes to George, who popped the question in 2017 after 14 months of dating.\n\nShe said: \"I think we're really good for each other in that way, we've got a really loving, stable relationship which I think is amazing, I can't stress how lovely it is to be in that.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"There's no drama, we're a team so I think we're really good for each other in that way and we're able to talk about everything and he's a good listener.\n\n\"It's definitely a big bonus having someone like that in your life.\n\n\"He ticks all the boxes so I'm really lucky.\"\n\n* Lisa Snowdon has partnered with Seven Seas Perfect7 to support the confidence curve campaign.
