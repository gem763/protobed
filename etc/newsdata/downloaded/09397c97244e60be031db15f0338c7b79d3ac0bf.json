Not too shabby.\n\nEarning up to \u00a312,000 for a sponsored Instagram post, the YouTuber, blogger and author definitely isn\u2019t doing too badly as she tops Heat magazine\u2019s annual guide to the UK\u2019s wealthiest stars.\n\nFood blogger Ella Mills (DeliciouslyElla) scooped up second place on the list, with an estimated wealth of \u00a32.5 million, with Tanya Burr taking the third place spot, with \u00a31.6 million.\n\nFashion blogger Victora Magrath came next (\u00a31.2 million), with cleanfluencer Sophie Hinchcliffe, also known as Mrs Hinch, racking up \u00a31 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoe has long been known as one of the most prolific internet stars in the UK \u2013 and her brother Joe\u2019s success on Strictly Come Dancing certainly hasn\u2019t hindered that.\n\nRacking up a whopping 11.6 million subscribers on her main channel, she\u2019s covered everything from beauty and lifestyle to opening up about her mental health.\n\nIn one video, she filmed her own smear test to reduce the stigma surrounding them and encourage women to go to their appointments.\n\nAfter the vlogger met with Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust she decided she wanted to help, \u2018or encourage women to feel a little more at ease\u2019, when they get their reminder letters to get their pap tests done.\n\n\u2018In all seriousness, I do feel that\u2019s its important and it\u2019s something I would have found very reassuring,\u2019 she said about the vlog, which was highly praised afterwards.\n\nMore recently, the star has celebrated her seven year anniversary with her boyfriend Alfie Deyes, with the star making a sweet photo frame for his girlfriend.\n\nWhile fans have often been keen for the pair to get engaged, they\u2019ve previously spoken out about taking it slowly and not feeling any pressure to rush into it, opening up about \u2018marriage and babies\u2019 in a 2018 video.\n\nAll in all, it seems the reign of Zoella doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
