A Chinese-language version seemed to go further, with the league saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d remarks.\n\nThat prompted a torrent of criticism in U.S. political circles, with a number of U.S. senators excoriating the league for what they saw as a willingness to allow China to censor free speech and trample other American values for the sake of profit.\n\n\u201cThe NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement. \u201cIn response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas, a self-described lifelong Rockets fan, wrote in a tweet on Sunday that he had been proud to see Morey \u201ccall out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,\u201d Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer wrote in a tweet.\n\nOther legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to U.S. politics, of a double standard when it comes to China.\n\nNBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including alleged police brutality and gun violence.\n\nPolice in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.\n\nThe Rockets\u2019 Morey, who was named NBA executive of the year in 2018, tweeted his support for the protests over the weekend. His initial tweet, which he swiftly deleted, included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMorey apologized on Monday.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d he said, adding that he had since heard and considered other perspectives and noting that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or the NBA.\n\n\u2018LONG TIME TO REPAIR\u2019\n\nMorey\u2019s support for the democracy protests, now in a fourth month, angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team\u2019s partners in a key market. Some 300 million people play the game in China, NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum told Reuters this month.\n\nNBA China, which conducts the league\u2019s business in the country, was launched in 2008. It is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nSome Chinese fans called for a boycott of the Rockets, who are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Chinese player Yao Ming in 2002. Yao became a star and helped build the NBA\u2019s following there.\n\n\u201cI watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I\u2019m still a Chinese person first and foremost,\u201d one social media user said.\n\nThe NBA logo is displayed as people pass by the NBA Store in New York City, U.S., October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by Yao, said it was suspending \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the team.\n\nSportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center suspended work with the Rockets, while the team\u2019s games were dropped by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s sports channel. Chinese technology company Tencent also said it would temporarily stop streaming Rockets games.\n\nCCTV said Morey\u2019s apology did not go far enough. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, tweeted on Monday: \u201cIf the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.\u201d\n\nJoseph Tsai, owner of the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), said the damage from Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cwill take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nThe NBA sought to contain the damage, saying in its statement that it recognized that Morey\u2019s views had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey,\u201d the league said in the Chinese-language version of its statement.\n\nThe NBA added, \u201cwe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together\u201d.\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nThe controversy over Morey\u2019s initial tweet and the NBA\u2019s handling of it arrived at a particularly delicate time in U.S.-China relations, which have soured as a result of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the two sides on each other\u2019s imports.\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched a new round of talks in Washington on Monday, with neither side showing signs of giving ground. The two days of negotiations are to be followed by the first minister-level trade talks in more than two months.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nThe NBA is also the latest example of a major brand caught in controversy over the Hong Kong protests.\n\nMany Western fashion brands, including Spain\u2019s Zara (ITX.MC), have been forced to clarify positions on Chinese sovereignty as the protests fuel nationalist fervor.\n\nChinese internet users in August blacklisted bubble tea brands from Taiwan after a Hong Kong franchise urged solidarity with protesters.", "description": "An increasing number of U.S. lawmakers voiced anger on Monday over the NBA's response to a Houston Rockets official's tweet backing Hong Kong democracy protests, raising U.S.-China tensions as talks to end a 15-month trade war resumed.", "authors": ["Paul Simao", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438167418&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961I6", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
