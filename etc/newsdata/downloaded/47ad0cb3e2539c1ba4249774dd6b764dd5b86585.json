The document \u2014 which addresses the resilience of the U.K. financial system in general \u2014 discusses innovative developments in the payments sector, noting that Libra has the potential to become \u201ca systemically important payment system.\u201d\n\nLaunch of new payment systems\n\nThe FPC pointed out that it would require payment systems like Libra to meet the highest standards of resilience and fall under relevant supervisory oversight. Moreover, the Committee urged regulators to adopt terms of engagement for innovative payment systems prior to their launch. The document further states:\n\n\u201cThe resilience of the proposed Libra system would rely on the stability of not just the core elements of the Libra Association and Libra Reserve but also the associated critical activities conducted by other firms in the Libra ecosystem such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers.\u201d\n\nWorld\u2019s regulators\u2019 skepticism toward Libra\n\nEarlier in October, Randall Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board, claimed that the potential scale of stablecoins such as Facebook\u2019s Libra could potentially bring a new scale and scope to the space, which the financial regulatory community must carefully consider. Quarles said:\n\n\u201cAlthough there is a small risk to financial stability today, there is no doubt the potential scale of stablecoins and other crypto-assets yet to emerge may pose regulatory challenges.\u201d\n\nRecently, French and German finance ministers also expressed skepticism regarding Libra, arguing that the project should not be authorized on European soil as it would imperil the countries\u2019 monetary sovereignty.\n\nMeanwhile, Lucas Geiger, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure startup Wireline, announced OpenLibra \u2014 a permissionless fork of Facebook\u2019s planned blockchain network.", "description": "The United Kingdom\u2019s central bank has singled out provisions for Facebook\u2019s yet-to-be-released Libra stablecoin", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjg3ZjRkZDI4NDM1YTA1ODQ3NTFmMzM5ZjQyOWFmOGUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
