Then, he said, \u201cthe court will expect to be addressed on the facts that present themselves\u201d.\n\nThey had also asked the court to use their unique powers, known as nobile officium, to write that letter on his behalf if he failed to do so. Carloway said they would postpone a decision on that too until 21 October.", "description": "Campaigners asked Scottish judges to order Johnson to write to EU if he fails to get deal", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebb5e978353f5607d26a16b819809ae2929aa6e/0_45_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d045ce1fcc5e0096d378b2a137a2d51", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
