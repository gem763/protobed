In fact, Barron had prohibited the young man from returning to her family\u2019s home after she caught him trying to steal from her, before he burglarized the restaurant.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it was Barron who called the police to arrest him after the burglary when she found him hiding in her home\u2019s crawlspace.\n\nThe officers arrested the teen, and Barron and Wylie thought that was the end of it.\n\nBut more than a month later, officers returned and ordered their landlord to evict them, pursuant to the city\u2019s crime-free housing ordinance.\n\nThe ordinance requires landlords in Granite City to obtain and annually renew a license to rent out their residential property. In order to obtain or renew the license, landlords must include a mandatory addendum to their leases and must evict any tenant who violates the ordinance or the addendum.\n\nThe lease addendum is the source of the crime-free housing policy\u2019s inequities. Combined with the requirements of the ordinance, it requires a landlord to evict a tenant when any member of the tenant\u2019s household commits a crime in the city, or when a guest of the tenant commits a crime on or near the property.\n\nIn order for a landlord to maintain his license, he must evict any tenant who violates the addendum.\n\nThe addendum is vague and overbroad, as Barron and Wylie\u2019s case illustrates. The police decided that their 19-year-old former houseguest was a member of their \u201chousehold,\u201d and therefore, his burglary meant that Barron and Wylie violated the addendum and had to be evicted.\n\nNot only is this outcome unjust, it discourages communities from helping troubled friends and family, and therefore encourages crime and recidivism. Without housing and a support network, it\u2019s difficult for anyone to get on\u2014or stay on\u2014the right path.\n\nAnd what of Barron and Wylie? They did nothing wrong. They didn\u2019t hide their houseguest after he committed a crime. They didn\u2019t help him commit a crime, and they didn\u2019t commit any crimes themselves. In fact, they turned him in. And yet they\u2019re set to be evicted.\n\nAnd what of their landlord? He doesn\u2019t want to evict them. He thinks they\u2019re good tenants and that the property should be his to rent out as he sees fit.\n\nBut none of them has a say in the matter.\n\nSo, all three of them, with help from the Institute for Justice, have joined forces to sue the city to stop the eviction.\n\nThey argue that Barron and Wylie are being unfairly punished for someone else\u2019s crime, which violates their right to due process. Their argument is a strong one.\n\nIt\u2019s based primarily on a Supreme Court case, Department of Housing v. Rucker. The Supreme Court ruled that when the government acts as a landlord of government-owned housing, it can evict tenants when their guests commit crimes.\n\nBut the court went out of its way to say that when the government is not acting as a landlord, but is instead \u201cattempting to criminally punish or civilly regulate\u201d members of the general public, it cannot punish people for the crimes of others.\n\nThat reasoning seems to apply in Barron and Wylie\u2019s case, so with any luck, they may not lose their home. But it\u2019s a shame that Granite City is trying so hard to punish their good deed.", "description": "Jessica Barron and Kenny Wylie, a couple renting their single-family home in Granite City, Illinois, know all too well that no good deed goes unpunished.\n\nFor two years, the parents of three children worked to make their modest home comfortable, not only for their family, but also for friends of their children who needed care, support, or simply a bed to sleep in for short periods of time.", "authors": ["Giancarlo Canaparo", "Commentary By", "Legal Fellow", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-826775276.jpg?itok=eJO0FgDA"}
