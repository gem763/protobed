Mohammed gives $50 to his family and keeps the rest as his allowance.\n\nEighteen-year-old Palestinian Ali al-Batniji is another apprentice in the same garage as Mohammed. He has seven sisters but no brothers, and his father is a farmer who does not make enough money to support them all, so Ali became an apprentice in order to help out with the family income.\n\nMohammed Yassin, 18, is a trainee in a different garage along with two of his cousins, and the three of them hope to be able to establish their own car repair centre some day. Most of the young apprentices left school at around 15 to begin their training, which may last about six years depending on how fast they learn.", "description": "Mohammed Jundeya is a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who left school to become an apprentice in a car repair garage and make some money to help support his family.", "authors": ["Mohammed Salem"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ7FG-UFE9oWR6bqJqp7xJAk0Hpw3pg9Es3dBEPB-LoPDdzf7nMk-CR4y48zeo7IQvbLFUWimUDlH756waZ6kFB8NKUUfIcNTKaJIpVQdVyzx", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
