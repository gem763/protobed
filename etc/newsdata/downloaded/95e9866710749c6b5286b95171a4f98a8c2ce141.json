Locksley would have loved to win more often, but he\u2019s in this for the long haul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Year 1 of the developmental stage of our program,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe want to win every week, that\u2019s our goal, but there are small battles within the game that we need to continue to show our players where we\u2019ve taken some steps forward as we develop the standards of how we play the game.\u201d\n\nMaryland beat Howard 79-0 in the opener and lost by six touchdowns last week, but that\u2019s not necessarily the only takeaway from then until now.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve taken some strides from the first game until now,\u201d defensive back Marcus Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of roller-coaster season, but we\u2019re only going to get better.\u201d\n\nThe Terps enter Saturday\u2019s game against No. 14 Michigan (6-2, 3-2) with uncertainty at quarterback after using three different players last week.\n\nTyrrell Pigrome hyperextended his left knee at Minnesota and is day-to-day. Josh Jackson (ankle) returned from a two-game absence to throw two passes before being benched, and third-stringer Tyler DeSue finished.\n\nWhile Pigrome adheres to a limited schedule at practice this week, Jackson will work with the No. 1 offense and DeSue, a redshirt freshman, will guide the No. 2 unit.\n\nAfter throwing seven touchdown passes in his first games, Jackson has tossed only three since \u2014 along with three interceptions. In his return last week, he was tentative and ineffective.\n\n\u201cI thought after he came off the field, I didn\u2019t feel like he had his confidence,\u201d said Locksley, who can only hope that won\u2019t be the case against Saturday against the nation\u2019s eighth-ranked defense.\n\n\u201cWith the time off and having only played limited reps Saturday, I feel like he\u2019s better,\u201d Locksley said of Jackson, a transfer from Virginia Tech.\n\nRunning back Anthony McFarland Jr. is nearly 100 percent healthy after spraining his ankle in Week 3 against Temple. He can only hope the Terps also operate at full efficiency against the Wolverines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to come out and execute,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cLooking at the film last week, we just left a lot out on the field, whether it was one person missing a block or us running wrong routes. All 11 of us have to lock in on each play.\u201d\n\nAgainst Indiana two weeks ago, the Terrapins made a game of it after falling behind 31-21. Against Minnesota, an early 14-0 deficit seemingly put Maryland into panic mode.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens sometimes to a team that needs to be taught and reminded about the right way to play.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s 14-0. We shouldn\u2019t watch the scoreboard,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI thought we took steps forward against Indiana, but we took steps back last week in the consistency of understanding that\u2019s the way you have to play. We keep trying to hammer home that philosophy and that standard.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Terrapins have lost five of six, are coping with two injured quarterbacks and must face Top 25 mainstays Michigan and Ohio State over the next weekends.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/Big_Ten_Spotlight_Football_76924.jpg-39601_c0-0-1740-1015_s1200x700.jpg?52b97285a50be64c223afc01885067279cce22b7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
