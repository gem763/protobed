Then, more briefly, it seemed that Boris Johnson, as a new prime minister, was driving towards a no-deal Brexit. When that was closed off, by the Benn Act at the beginning of September, and with Labour reluctant to agree to an election, it seemed as if we might just face many months of deadlock, dither and delay.\n\nTonight, the House of Commons finally voted for something. The first critical vote on the legislation to implement the Brexit deal was won by a margin of 30 \u2013 a stark contrast with Theresa May\u2019s third and final defeat by a margin of 58.\n\nCharacteristically for this indecisive parliament, it balanced its vote for something by voting against another thing. Thus the prime minister\u2019s great triumph, which is undeniable, is a qualified one. He now has no chance of taking the country out of the EU next Thursday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Instead of pulling the bill, he said the government would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d while it waited for the EU to respond.\n\nThat means, I imagine, that he will tell the EU leaders that, if they give him a few more weeks, he will get the legislation through parliament. Given that Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, offered to discuss a timetable, rumoured to be seven to nine days, it seems likely that something could be agreed that would get the withdrawal agreement bill done within a month.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Tonight\u2019s first vote suggested that there would be. A margin of 30 allows for several Labour MPs such as Lisa Nandy and Gloria De Piero, who voted for the principle of the bill in the hope of amending it, and who reserved the right to vote against it at a later stage if they didn\u2019t get what they wanted.\n\nSo it is worth pausing to recognise the significance of what has just happened. The prime minister was entitled to point out, in his comments after the vote, that \u201cjust a few weeks ago, hardly anybody believed we could reopen the withdrawal agreement\u201d. Johnson\u2019s repeated defeats in parliament, and his repeated insistence that he wasn\u2019t going to do things he was eventually forced into doing, distracted attention from his achievements.\n\nFirst, he negotiated a deal that few thought possible. Theresa May did that too, as everyone has now long forgotten, but she didn\u2019t get close to winning the approval of the House of Commons. Now Johnson has succeeded. He has judged the mood of the House better than most commentators. I certainly thought there was no prospect of winning a majority if the DUP remained opposed.\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t judgement \u2013 it may just have been desperation, with nowhere else to turn \u2013 but he did it. I don\u2019t know how much he understood about the mood of exhaustion among Labour MPs, but he did grasp the effectiveness of the slogan, \u201cGet Brexit Done.\u201d And he probably understood better than most people that the Tory Eurosceptics would not, after all, take their cue from the DUP \u2013 all of them voted for the bill.\n\nAs a result, we will probably be out of the EU by Christmas.", "description": "For a long time it seemed as if we might never leave the EU.
