Weaker domestic and foreign demand would lead to lower trajectories for employment, wages and household income.\n\n\"As a result of all these changes, household spending, business investment and exports would be weaker and real GDP would be about 4.5% lower by the end of 2021 relative to the base-case projection,\" the bank said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar would depreciate by roughly 15% and \"play a key role\" in the domestic economy's ability to adjust to a weaker global economic outlook by helping contain adverse effects on exports and income.\n\nThe forecast assumes no new tariffs would be imposed and that monetary and fiscal policies in Canada and the rest of the world did not respond to additional economic weaknesses.\n\nWeaker potential output associated with less business investment would negatively affect the supply side economy, the bank suggested. However, these supply effects, combined with a lower Canadian dollar, would partially mitigate the negative impact of weaker aggregate demand on inflation.\n\nOverall, the bank estimated in its scenario, CPI inflation would be 0.7 percentage points lower than in the base case in 2021.\n\nGlobal GDP would drop by 2.25% by the end of 2021 while commodity prices would plunge by approximately 20-25%.\n\nIn July, the Bank of Canada released a scenario projecting Canada's economy would shrink by around 6% by end-2021 if the United States increased tariffs on all imports by 25% and its trading partners followed suit.
