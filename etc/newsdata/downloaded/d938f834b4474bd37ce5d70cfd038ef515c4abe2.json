The Acura and a cruiser collided and at least two other officers fired at the vehicle.\n\nThe car managed to escape again and drove into Anne Arundel and Howard County, where police later found the vehicle.\n\nThe Acura had shattered windows and small amounts of blood inside, but it was not clear whether the officers\u2019 rounds struck the driver, Stawinski said. \u201cThe amount of blood we\u2019re seeing at this point is not consistent with a gunshot injury,\u201d he said.\n\nStawinski declined to say whether officers were fired upon, saying that they had yet to apprehend the driver of the Acura.\n\nInvestigators have contacted local hospitals but no one has arrived for treatment of a gunshot wound, Stawinski said.\n\nPolice were continuing to look for the 20-year-old, who they said was wanted on a warrant. Officials did not immediately release the details of that warrant.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Prince George\u2019s County police said they were trying to stop a vehicle when the driver fled.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iQzIYXbqj1pyq0MDJhl0EL1oxrY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WFAFG5S7WMI6TPZE3NFZ7NRKUI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
