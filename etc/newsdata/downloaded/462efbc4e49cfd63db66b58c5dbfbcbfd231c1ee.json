Students who are quasi-randomly assigned to schools with higher conditional suspension rates are significantly more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThis shows that early censure of school misbehavior causes increases in adult crime \u2014 that there is, in fact, a \u2018school to prison pipeline.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, correlation is different from causation, statisticians say.\n\nStudents who attended one-standard-deviation-stricter middle schools were 1.7 percentage points (15%) more likely to drop out, 2.4 percentage points (11%) less likely to go to college, 3.2 percentage points (17%) more likely to have been arrested, and 2.5 percentage points (20%) more likely to have been incarcerated, the researchers found.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics data has long shown a link between education and earnings. Median weekly earnings in 2017 for people with a high-school diploma and no college were $712; for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree, they were $1,173.\n\nMinority and male students experienced the largest negative impacts from attending schools that were stricter on suspension, \u201csuggesting that strict suspension policies expand pre-existing gaps in educational attainment and incarcerations,\u201d the researchers wrote. There was \u201csome limited evidence\u201d that white male students\u2019 academic achievement improved, on the other hand, showing \u201cthe potential to increase the achievement of some subgroups by removing disruptive peers.\u201d\n\nThe study findings also suggested that suspension rates changed with the entry or exit of a new principal.\n\n\u201cTaken together, the evidence suggests that principals and other school officials have considerable discretion over discipline policy, and when they lean toward harsher discipline it has negative long-run impacts on students, especially minority males,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe authors analyzed administrative school data, arrest and incarceration data, and college attendance records from the National Student Clearinghouse, an enrollment-verification nonprofit. Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools are \u201cfairly representative of large, urban school districts\u201d in the South despite their above-the-national-average suspension and crime rates, the study said.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that black students are suspended far more often than their white peers. A 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that while black students made up less than 16% of public-school students, they accounted for some 39% of suspended students.\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments in December rescinded Obama-era guidelines aimed at reducing racial discrimination in school discipline after a commission led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recommended their withdrawal. The commission argued that the previous administration\u2019s guidance \u201cmay have paradoxically contributed to making schools less safe\u201d and raised legal concerns, while civil-rights organizations and Democrats opposed the move.", "description": "Researchers from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School and the University of Colorado analyzed data on suspension rates.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR386_suspen_ZG_20190916125830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
