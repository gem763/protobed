That story originally claimed it was Sophie Schmidt who suggested to Alexander Nix, the former director of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company SCL, that he should get in touch with Peter Thiel\u2019s Palantir and look into using data mining techniques to bolster their political operations.\n\n\u201cAny trust I had in The Guardian was wrecked when the paper failed to stand by its own reporting,\u201d he wrote, according to an excerpt of Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America seen by The Daily Beast.\n\nA Guardian news & media spokesperson said, \u201cWe are disappointed that this book appears to contain factual inaccuracies about the Guardian which were not put to us prior to publication.\n\n\u201cWe have raised a number of concerns with the publishers and are talking to them about how they plan to rectify this.\u201d\n\nThe reporter who wrote the story, Carole Cadwalladr, said it was incredibly difficult for British media organizations to stand up to well-resourced legal threats.\n\n\u201cSchmidt bullied a British newspaper using British privacy laws. It's extraordinary that the daughter of Eric Schmidt\u2014the man who says that privacy is dead\u2014would be using U.K. privacy laws to get herself taken out of the piece,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cNews organizations have difficult choices to make, don\u2019t have an endless pot of money, and have to make hard choices. It's a measure of the difficulty of publishing this work that The Guardian decided they couldn't defend that one.\u201d\n\nSchmidt was an intern at SCL when Wylie writes that she \u201cintroduced Alexander to some of the executives at Palantir.\u201d The New York Times later reported on Schmidt\u2019s alleged suggestion. Palantir, a secretive tech company, was co-founded by Thiel, a Silicon Valley billionaire and major Trump donor, who also sits on the board of Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Cambridge Analytica had dealings with Palantir suggested by the daughter of Eric Schmidt the chairman of Google just seemed like a really massive deal because the whole piece was about the power of these Silicon Valley tech companies,\u201d Cadwalladr said.\n\nWylie wrote that he was not one of the sources who had spoken to Cadwalladr about Schmidt, but he said he did know of Schmidt\u2019s role in the history of the company.\n\n\u201cThe story wasn\u2019t remotely libelous. Schmidt threw a battalion of lawyers at The Guardian, with the threat of a time-consuming and expansive legal battle. Instead of fighting an obviously spurious lawsuit, the paper agreed to remove Schmidt\u2019s name several weeks after publication,\u201d he said. Cadwalladr emphasized that it was privacy concerns rather than libel that were raised.\n\n\u201cThen Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue over the same article,\u201d Wylie writes. \u201cAnd even though The Guardian had documents, emails, and files that confirmed everything I had told them, they backed down again. Editors agreed to flag certain paragraphs as \u2018disputed,\u2019 to appease Cambridge Analytica and mitigate the paper\u2019s liability. They took Cadwalladr\u2019s well-sourced story and watered it down. At this point, my heart sank. I thought, All right, I\u2019ve just moved back to London, I haven\u2019t got a job, and I\u2019m being asked to put my neck on the line for a newspaper that won\u2019t even defend its own journalism.\u201d", "description": "Fairfax Media/GettyLONDON\u2014Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, claims that Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, successfully campaigned for The Guardian to scrub her name from one of their bombshell data-abuse stories.In a memoir that will be published", "authors": ["Nico Hines"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H1j72ZAKsMsRa0LWycTHJQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/10377f50377794121b5d473f4af16b58", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
