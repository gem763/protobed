In return, the developers would restrict rent increases.\n\nAccording to Rochabrun, the approved program included a letter from the New York City mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, stating that rent stabilization should only apply to those who paid less than $2,000 a month for an apartment.\n\nRead more: A former NYC drug cop who bought his first property for $22,000 now has a $400 million real-estate portfolio, and he says he doesn't even track the value of it\n\nThe letter was read into record and, according to Rochabrun, accepted as the common interpretation of the law. As a result, 75% of all the apartments built under the program have been subjected to rent increases, Rochabrun reported.\n\nWhile the program ended in 2006, according to Rochabrun, many developers are still benefiting from it. In fact, he reported that the city lost around $75 million in tax revenue in 2015 as a result of the program.\n\nLawyers and tenants are now arguing that the program was misinterpreted. A program that was intended to pair tax benefits with rent regulation, according to reports, did the opposite in most cases.\n\nNow, 0ver two decades later, tenants are fighting back.\n\nAccording to the New York-based news outlet The City, in June, the New York Court of Appeals ruled in favor of tenants from two Lower Manhattan buildings who argued that since the owners benefited from the 421-g tax breaks, the rents of their apartments should have been stabilized.\n\nIn light of the ruling, current or former tenants of the Lower Manhattan buildings that received tax breaks because of the program may be able to collect up to six years of back rent, The City reported.\n\nAn analysis conducted by the news outlet found that 39 buildings received tax benefits from the program between 1995 and 2006.\n\nBut the fight for back rent isn't the only lawsuit that has loomed over New York's real-estate industry this year. As Business Insider previously reported, in January, a $21 million lawsuit was filed in New York accusing various real-estate brokers of using Airbnb to illegally rent over 250 listings to nearly 76,000 unknowing guests.", "description": "The misinterpretation of a tax-break program may force some building owners in Lower Manhattan to pay up.", "authors": ["Libertina Brandt"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d52dccfcd978408ab07a878-1920-960.jpg"}
