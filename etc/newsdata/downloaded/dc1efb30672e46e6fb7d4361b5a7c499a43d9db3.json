I did push past and got on the train and I showed him my pass.\n\n'I was on my way to another charity event so did not want to miss my train. He was a white man with a thick South African accent.'\n\nBur Mr Blanchard insisted the man was black and added: 'Jim made a couple of phone calls moaning about him and repeatedly used the same kind of dismissive and abusive language.'\n\nThe incident took place at Euston station in London, on a train headed to Milton Keynes\n\nBritish Transport Police said in a statement: ''British Transport Police are aware of a report of racial abuse on board a Virgin Trains service travelling to Milton Keynes Central. Officers await further information in relation to this incident and would ask witnesses to contact BTP by sending a text to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 448 of 06/10/2019.'\n\nIt is not the first time Davidson has faced allegations of racism after he vowed in June to never visit London again.\n\nHe accused the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan of having 'f***** up' his home town.\n\nDavidson was forced to clarify his comments after fellow social media users accused him of racism.\n\nHe said wrote: 'To all you twitter (sic) moaners re my coment (sic) on my home town. It is purely the congestion and traffic I cannot bare but all you lefties can still call me racsist (sic) if if (sic) gets you off Charlton? You can bypass London and go through Kent.'\n\nDavidson, who was popular in the 1980s, had earlier been accused of making homophobic and racist jokes.\n\nHis humour was also very critical of the working class during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street.", "description": "Jim Davidson, 65, has been accused of telling a black train attendant that he isn't 'welcome in this country' while on a train from London Euston to Milton Keynes Central.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/13/19393926-0-image-a-7_1570449763890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
