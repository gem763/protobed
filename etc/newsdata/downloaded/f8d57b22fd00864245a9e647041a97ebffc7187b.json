But we looked at our collection and noticed that there were female artists before this time.\n\n\"How did they get prominence? How did they [succeed] in getting their works into the collection of [the national gallery]? And how should you assess these paintings today?\"\n\nThe exhibition \u2013 Fighting for Visibility: Women Artists in the National Gallery before 1919 \u2013 covers various styles and formats, emphasising that there is no such thing as \"women's art\".\n\nCurator Yvette Deseyve said a visitor who looks at the pieces in the exhibition without reading the descriptions might not notice that they were all made by women.\n\nShe explained: \"There isn't such a thing as a typical female way of looking at things. There isn't such a thing as women's art. They were working just like their male counterparts with the same sorts of styles and formats.\"\n\nThe exhibition runs from October 11 to March 8, 2020.", "description": "Germany's National Gallery is celebrating 100 years since women were admitted to the Berlin Academy of Arts.
