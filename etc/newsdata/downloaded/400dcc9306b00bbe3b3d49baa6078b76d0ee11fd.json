Mr. Trump insisted on a quick and comprehensive elimination of all the North\u2019s nuclear warheads, as well as their means of delivery and production facilities, before easing any of the international sanctions.\n\nMs. Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman, said the American negotiators had traveled to Stockholm with \u201ccreative ideas and had good discussions\u201d with their North Korean counterparts. Mr. Kim, the chief North Korean negotiator, said his side had explained a \u201cpractical\u201d idea on how to end the stalemate, but he accused his American counterparts of repeating their \u201cold position and attitude.\u201d\n\nKim Dong-yub, a North Korea expert at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said, \u201cThe negotiations likely have floundered from the beginning because North Korea and the United States both sought to get too much while offering too little.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said progress could be made only when the United States ended its policy that \u201cthreatens the security of the country and hampers the rights to existence and development of its people.\u201d Mr. Kim, the North Korean negotiator, cited international sanctions and the United States\u2019 joint military exercises with South Korea as part of such policy.\n\nIn a speech in April, Kim Jong-un said he would wait until the end of the year for Washington to come up with a more flexible proposal \u2014 a deadline his Foreign Ministry reiterated on Sunday. North Korea has since issued vague warnings that it might end a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, which Mr. Trump cited as one of his biggest gains in his on-off diplomacy with the North.", "description": "The North said that it would not meet with American negotiators again until after Washington took a step toward \u201ccomplete and irreversible withdrawal of hostile policy.\u201d", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/world/06nkorea/merlin_162214968_5899b160-91c2-4023-8dba-2ecf896b14a2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
