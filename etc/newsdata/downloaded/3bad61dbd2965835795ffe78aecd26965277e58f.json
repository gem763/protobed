Any of those names look familiar? Yep, those are all major oil companies.\n\nAnd those bars represent how much carbon and methane emissions they've output into the world between 1965 and 2017.\n\nThe graph has been constructed by the Climate Accountability Institute, a group that looks to protect the world from and raise awareness about the \"social, economic, and environmental damages of climate change.\"\n\nYou see, we've traditionally measured pollution contribution levels by country. However back in 2010, researcher Richard Heede decided to instead measure this based on historical emissions of single entities, basically megacorporations. For oil companies for instance, he did this by calculating the pollution output that would correlate to the amount of fossil fuel they've extracted over time.\n\nHeede concluded that nearly two-thirds of carbon dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to the 90 largest fossil fuel and cement producers, most of which still operate today.\n\nReuters\n\nDon't Miss 101 SHARES 560 SHARES 323 SHARES 376 SHARES 337 SHARES\n\nAs you can see from the graph, Saudi Aramco tops out at a whopping 59,262 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, well about the approximately 43,000 metric tons of both US-based Chevron and Russia-based Gazprom. Even the smallest contributer here, Peabody Energy, has output at least 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the environment.\n\nWhat's even scarier though is how Saudi Aramco gets to the top of this list. Look closer, and you'll see that it starts right at the bottom in 1965, even dropping out of the top 20 list for a couple of years before reappearing around 1971. And when it does, it just rockets to the top of the list in the span of about 25 years.\n\nReuters\n\nHeede himself remarked at how fast the state-owned oil companies from the gulf rose in oil and gas production over the period studied. And part of that is because of the Oil embargo of 1973, During that time, members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries cut off their oil supplies to nations they thought supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Of course, what also matters is that oil and natural gas harvesting was brought under national governments in the Gulf in the mid 1970s.\n\nNow, Saudi Aramco is apparently responsible for 4.38 percent of all carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the 52-year period studied. That's 59.26 billion tons in total. In fact, these top 20 polluting companies alone account for 35.45 percent of all global emissions over the past half century.\n\nTwelve of these companies are state-owned, including Gazprom, Saudi Aramco, the National Iranian Oil Company, PetroChina, and Coal India. Yeah, we're not free of blame either.\n\nReuters\n\nThere is a chance to reverse this though, Heede says. According to him, one way to fix things is for these major polluting companies to reduce their emissions through carbon capture and sequestration. It's not even a 100 percent fix, just a slight improvement. But because it's expensive to implement most don't bother.\n\n\"These companies can't publicly commit to respect the science and global requirements,\" Heede says. \"In aggregate, their production and emissions are still rising when the world is calling for reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and fossil fuels.\"", "description": "See that animated graph down there with the growing coloured bars?
