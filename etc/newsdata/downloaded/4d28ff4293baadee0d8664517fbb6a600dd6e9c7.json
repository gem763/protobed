Last Thursday, the plane crashed 59 minutes after taking off from the eastern city of Goma bound for the capital Kinshasa. None of the eight people on board survived, officials said.\n\nThe passengers were identified as the personal chauffeur of Felix Tshisekedi, Congo\u2019s president, and three of his bodyguards. An armoured vehicle used by the president was also on board.\n\nA more troubling disclosure followed when two of the four-strong crew were identified. Vitaly Shumkov and Vladimir Sadovnichy, the plane\u2019s pilots, were not only Russian nationals, they both appeared to have a background in gun running.\n\nThe plane, too, has a murky past. EK-72903 was once owned by an Armenian company whose proprietor has been linked to arms smuggling elsewhere in Africa.\n\nWhether the crew were somehow furthering Kremlin interests remains unknown. However, there is no secret that Russia hopes to regain the influence the Soviet Union once wielded in Africa by wooing its leaders with arms sales, private security and \u201cpolitical technologists\u201d adept at winning elections.\n\nSuch attempts have often been linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin who has been accused of masterminding attempts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nMr Prigozhin allegedly had Congo in his sights after Russia announced in May that it was sending a team of army specialists to the country.\n\nSome Russia media outlets speculated that Mr Prigozhin, was on board the plane ahead of a meeting with President Tshisekedi.\n\nThat is almost certainly untrue. Slumming it on an Antonov is generally not Mr Progozhin\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t get into a plane like that,\u201d a Congolese government official said.\n\n\u201cThis gentleman is an oligarch and if he travels then he travels on his own plane.\u201d\n\nThe official said that while Mr Prigozhin had not been scheduled to meet President Tshisekedi, other Russian government representatives had requested a meeting to discuss the upcoming summit.\n\nIt is unclear if any were on board. At least two people described as being \u201cof eastern European origin\u201d were also on the plane. They have not yet been identified, adding to the intrigue surrounding the flight.\n\nFor the moment, whoever else was on board the plane remains unknown. With some sources saying there may have been 11 people rather than eight on board, UN officials were attempting to identify the remains of the dead \u2014 some of whom had been hastily buried \u2014 last night.\n\nEven that might not put an end to the intrigue of what happened aboard EK-72903. Congo rarely gives up its mysteries. In 1961, a plane departing the country with then UN secretary general Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld on board crashed.\n\nThree inquiries failed to determined the cause of the crash and Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death remains a mystery to this day.", "description": "The Democratic Republic of Congo has one of the world\u2019s worst aviation safety records, so reports that an aircraft had tumbled into a remote forest last week caused few international ripples.
