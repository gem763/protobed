One source with knowledge of the project reportedly described it as a \u201cshit show,\u201d and the console is reportedly shaping up to be more of a Linux PC than a dedicated games console.\n\nAtari\u2019s post sought to assure backers that the project is proceeding as planned. Amidst numerous photographs of the console\u2019s circuit boards and chassis, the company claimed that the molds for the plastic housing of the console are \u201clargely complete,\u201d that its controllers and joysticks are \u201cjust about ready for mass production,\u201d and that it expects to host hands-on preview events for the console later this fall.\n\nOne source reportedly described the console\u2019s development as a \u201cshit show\u201d\n\nThe Register\u2019s report, however, paints a very different picture of the console\u2019s development. For starters, the console\u2019s lead architect, Rob Wyatt, has quit the project and claimed that his design consultancy hasn\u2019t been paid in over six months. Wyatt\u2019s Tin Giant consultancy was hired to develop the console\u2019s hardware and software shortly before the console\u2019s $3 million IndieGoGo campaign came to a close in June last year.\n\nThe report goes on to say that the so-called \u201cconsole\u201d will actually function more like a PC in a custom-chassis, and will run on a standard Linux distribution after Atari\u2019s executives refused to approve the development of a custom operating system. It will also reportedly not feature an app store, another common feature of most consoles. Atari\u2019s post appears to partially disagree with this assessment, and mentions what it calls the machine\u2019s \u201ccustom Atari operating system.\u201d However, even Atari admits that the machine operates \u201cmore like a computer than a fully-functional game system at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe console also reportedly suffers from a myriad of other software issues. The Register claims that the console\u2019s controllers might not work consistently across games, as you\u2019d expect a console controller to, and that the promised streaming apps will actually consist of web apps accessed through a modified browser. The report says that the console, which will retail for prices starting at $250 in the US, is effectively just a Steam Machine, a Linux PC designed for gaming.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Atari disagreed with many of the claims made in The Register\u2019s report. \u201dAtari wishes to inform you that some of your questions indicate that you possess information that is incorrect and/or outdated,\u201d a statement given to The Register from Atari\u2019s PR firm read, \u201cIn addition, some aspects of the Atari VCS project clearly have been leaked to you in violation of existing confidentiality agreements, and Atari therefore hereby reserves its rights in that respect.\u201d\n\nWe have contacted Atari to ask when the campaign\u2019s backers, as well as customers who have pre-ordered the console from GameStop and Walmart can expect to receive their consoles, and we\u2019ll update this piece with its response. In the meantime it\u2019s well worth reading The Register\u2019s report in its entirety for a full catalog of the issues the console is reportedly facing.", "description": "Atari has put out a lengthy development update for the Atari VCS console.
