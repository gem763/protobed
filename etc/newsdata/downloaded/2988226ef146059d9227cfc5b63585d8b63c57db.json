It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA.

Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who told the Washington Post the G7 decision was \"politically insensitive.\" \"They should have known what the kickback is going to be on this, that politically he\u2019s doing it for his own benefit,\" he said.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who's criticized Trump for his Syria policy and allegations concerning the president and Ukraine, called the G7 decision \"a very unusual site selection,\" per Reuters.\n\nAfter the G7 announcement, the conservative anti-Trump group Republicans for the Rule of Law \"released an ad accusing Trump of using his office for personal enrichment,\" Reuters notes.\n\nGo deeper: Trump made at least $434 million from his business in 2018\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
