Innovid raised $30 million from Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing in January to support its expansion. The company is preparing for a possible IPO in the next two years, it said.\n\nThe acquisition comes as ad-tech players increasingly focus on selling more video inventory on platforms like mobile and connected TV.\n\n\u201cDisplay is a bad business,\u201d said Zvika Netter, CEO of Innovid. \u201cThis is why we stayed away from it. Everybody is gunning for TV.\u201d\n\nBut Innovid is still interested in Herolens\u2019s technology as more marketers consolidate ad-tech relationships and look for alternatives to Google and Amazon.com Inc., which recently agreed to acquire assets of Sizmek, including its ad server and creative ad technology, he said.\n\n\u201cMarketers are vetting their vendors to try to find the three-to-four really smart, good ones as opposed to having 20 or more,\u201d said Orchid Richardson, vice president and managing director of the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s Data Center of Excellence. The trend is driven in part by marketers bringing their digital advertising and data operations in-house and looking for more efficient relationships with vendors, she said.\n\nHerolens, founded in 2015, offers ad serving technology that helps send display ads to different websites based on user data, as well as a system that automates the creation of numerous versions of a display ad.\n\nThe acquisition isn\u2019t about adding another business line, but about rounding out Innovid\u2019s capabilities, Mr. Netter said.\n\nInnovid might use data gleaned from its display ad tools\u2014whether people see or engage with a banner ad, for example\u2014to inform a client\u2019s TV ad strategy, for example. Alternately, the company\u2019s TV data insights can be used to retarget users on cheaper media, such as display ads on desktop computers or mobile.\n\nInnovid plans to increase headcount at Herolens to about 60 employees from roughly 40, he said.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "description": "As many advertising-technology companies diversify beyond serving display ads, a category that is dominated by Google, Innovid is instead making its latest bet on display.", "authors": ["Alexandra Bruell", "Alexandra.Bruell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://s.wsj.net/img/meta/wsj-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
