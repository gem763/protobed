It also opens the door to obligations being imposed on internet companies to proactively monitor content and then interpret if it is \u2018equivalent\u2019 to content that has been found to be illegal,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cIn order to get this right national courts will have to set out very clear definitions on what \u2018identical\u2019 and \u2018equivalent\u2019 means in practice. We hope the courts take a proportionate and measured approach, to avoid having a chilling effect on freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nU.K. rights group Article 19 backed Facebook, saying it could lead to social platforms installing automated filters to screen out content.\n\n\u201cThis would set a dangerous precedent where the courts of one country can control what internet users in another country can see. This could be open to abuse, particularly by regimes with weak human rights records,\u201d executive director Thomas Hughes said.\n\nFacebook found itself in the dock after Eva Glawisching-Piesczek, then chairwoman of the Greens parliamentary group in Austria, sued the company in an Austrian court, asking that it delete defamatory comments posted by a user and also to remove equivalent claims.\n\nGlawischnig\u2019s lawyer Maria Windhager welcomed the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe CJEU is taking a position on this issue in that it is saying one must create and strengthen instruments for the enforcement of personal rights,\u201d she told Austrian national broadcaster ORF.\n\n\u201cIt is less about there being fewer hate postings (after the ruling) but much more about increasing awareness that we can successfully defend ourselves against this and that it will be used more and that this then strengthens all of us in the fight against online hate speech.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission said the ruling was limited to court orders and doesn\u2019t apply to wider complaints by users alleging that certain content is illegal.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling is the final judgment in case C-18/18 Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland Limited.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Facebook slams ruling, saying it's not the role of social platforms to monitor, interpret and remove speech that may be illegal in any particular country", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/facebook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
