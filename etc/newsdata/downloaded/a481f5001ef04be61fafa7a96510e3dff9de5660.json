Add the bacon and fry, 4 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Set aside.\n\nCombine the water, milk and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and stir until the butter has melted. Turn the heat down and whisk in the flour. Cook 1 minute, or until the mixture pulls away from the side and forms a ball. Remove the mixture from the heat and set aside to cool, 5 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the eggs, one at a time. The mixture will split at first. Once all the eggs have been incorporated the mixture will look smooth and shiny. Set aside.\n\n\n\nCombine the bacon, garlic, spring onions, salt and pepper in a food processor and blend until fine but slightly chunky. Stir this into the dough mixture together with the mozzarella and corn.\n\n\n\nHeat the oil for deep-frying to 180\u00b0C. Using a teaspoon or small ice cream scoop, gently drop in spoonful\u2019s of the batter. Fry until golden and crisp, 1-2 minutes per side. Drain on kitchen paper.\n\n\n\nFor the lime mayo, stir all of the ingredients together, season to taste and serve as a dip with the fritters. Serve with extra lime wedges and Windhoek beer.\n\nTIP: If you like smoky flavours, add a few drops of liquid smoke to the fritter batter before frying.\n\nIn partnership with Windhoek.\n\n", "description": "Crunchy deep-fried pastries served with a zesty lime mayo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9427/f242a379fc3c4e3db044d24b3f65e05b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
