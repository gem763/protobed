Two oil barrels have been found on two beaches off Sergipe state, local authorities said.\n\nBeachgoers and fishermen have been urged to avoid the material.\n\nTwo sea turtles rescued alive were returned to the sea by beachgoers while another was sent to a rehabilitation centre.\n\nThe situation was said to be stable in the most-affected state, Rio Grande do Norte, while efforts were now being focused on Maranh\u00e3o - part of the Amazon rainforest region - where new spills were being reported.\n\n\"We've never had an accident like this in Brazil... It's the first time we're seeing an accident with an undetermined source affecting so many states,\" Ibama co-ordinator Fernanda Pirillo was quoted by Ag\u00eancia Brasil news agency as saying.\n\nPetrobras said it would deploy some 100 employees in the clean-up effort despite not being involved in the spill.\n\nStates affected by oil spill\n\n1 - Sergipe; 2 - Alagoas; 3 - Pernambuco; 4 - Para\u00edba; 5 - Rio Grande do Norte; 6 - Cear\u00e1; 7 - Piau\u00ed; 8 - Maranh\u00e3o\n\nAnna Carolina Lobo, a co-ordinator of the marine programme at WWF conservation group in Brazil, said the case exposed how fragile the country's surveillance system was.\n\n\"Brazil has few boats and analysts to follow what happens in our waters,\" Ms Lobo was quoted by Associated Press as saying.\n\nShe said state support for such surveillance was receding even further under the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe president, who came to office in January, has repeatedly criticised the work of non-governmental groups and activists, and slashed the budget of environmental agencies, including Ibama.\n\nYou may also find interesting", "description": "At least six sea turtles have been found dead as officials still investigate the source of the oil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162E1/production/_108994809_oil2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
