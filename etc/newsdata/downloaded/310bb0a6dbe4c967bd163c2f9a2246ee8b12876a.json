RACISM' HEADLINE AFTER BACKLASH\n\n\"This is un-American,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in defense of Trump's comments. \"I've never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody's accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on her behalf, and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge.\"\n\nIn an op-ed from 1998, Times columnist Frank Rich wrote that Republicans treated former President Bill Clinton in a way that reinforced African-Americans' fear of the legal system. His use of \"lynching\" was explicitly tied to race, whereas Trump's wasn't.\n\n\"Though Bill Clinton has done little more for African-Americans than O. J. Simpson did, his support remains near-unanimous in black America,\" he wrote.\n\n\"If nothing else, this is a measure of how deeply blacks still fear that our legal machinery can be stacked in favor of a lynch mob. And it's hardly a mindless argument. The most rabid Clinton-haters in Congress are white Southerners, led by Bob Barr, who has spoken before the racist Council of Conservative Citizens. An impeachment trial's jury of 100 senators will be whites only.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWriter Maureen Dowd, also in 1998, appeared to argue that Republicans and Independent Counsel Ken Starr acted like a lynch mob.\n\n\"The Clintons attack Mr. Starr to deflect attention from the president's immoral behavior,\" she wrote. \"They appeal to decent American impulses -- we do not like lynch mobs, we do not like hate-mongering, we do not like women who rat out girlfriends, we do not like Big Brother peeking through bedroom windows. The Clintons elicit our public-spirited impulses and use them for their private political gain.\n\nFox News contacted The New York Times for comment.", "description": "As many Democrats took aim at Trump for his use of the term \"lynching\" this week, a quick look at the archives from some major media outlets show they used similar language at the time of the Clinton Impeachment.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
