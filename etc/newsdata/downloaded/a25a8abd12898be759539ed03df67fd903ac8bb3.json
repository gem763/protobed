Harvey Weinstein: his accusers 1/42 Harvey Weinstein Harry Weinstein\u2019s reputation as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading executives was long cemented in stone. The acclaimed movie mogul, who produced Oscar-winning films Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, and The Artist, clocked up box office successes and accolades aplenty. But this has quickly changed since a chorus of women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment and assault. Since the New York Times\u2019 bombshell report disclosed sexual harassment and rape allegations against the film mogul dating back decades, Weinstein has been fired from his namesake company, expelled from the Oscars and has had his wife leave him. Weinstein has apologised for having \u201ccaused a lot of pain\u201d but has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Getty 2/42 Annabella Sciorra The Sopranos actor alleged Weinstein raped her after shooting The Night We Never Met, a 1993 movie that Weinstein produced. Similar to the stories told by other women, Weinstein drove the actor home, only to reportedly burst into Sciorra's apartment and start unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cHe shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me,\u201d Sciorra said. \u201cI kicked and I yelled.\u201d Weinstein then allegedly locked her arms and forced sexual intercourse on her. After the incident, Sciorra found it increasingly hard to get work, many filmmakers saying 'We heard you were difficult', something the actor claims was because of the 'Weinstein-machine'. Getty 3/42 Natassia Malthe The model and actress, who has appeared in around 50 films, said she met Weinstein at a BAFTA after party in 2008 while she was working as a spokeswoman for LG. She told a press conference in New York that she felt pressured into telling Weinstein she was staying at the Sanderson Hotel after being put on the spot. Malthe, now 43, said after her shift on February 10 she went back to her room and went to sleep, but was awoken by \"repeated pounding\" on her door, from someone yelling: \"Open the door Natassia Malthe, it's Harvey Weinstein.\" Feeling humiliated, she said she opened the door. She alleged Weinstein began implying sex would get her a role in an upcoming film while semi-undressed and then he began to masturbate. \"I was sitting on the bed talking to Harvey when he pushed me back and forced himself onto me. It was not consensual. He did not use a condom,\" she said. AP 4/42 Sean Young The actor, best known for her role in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, said that Weinstein exposed himself to her in the early 1990s, when she was starring in the Miramax-produced Love Crimes - a production company that Weinstein headed at the time. \"I personally experienced him pulling his you-know-what out of his pants to shock me,\" she said. \"My basic response was, 'You know, Harvey, I really don\u2019t think you should be pulling that thing out, it\u2019s not very pretty.'\" Young never worked with Weinstein again after the incident. 5/42 Mimi Haleyi Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child's bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s. She said she was aspiring to work in television and film production when she was first introduced to him at the London premiere of The Aviator around two years earlier and he helped her get experience on the set of a TV show being produced by The Weinstein Company. But, she added, he repeatedly hassled her and even tried to force himself through her front door in an effort to get her to join him on a trip to Paris. At one point he allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on an aspiring production assistant while she was on her period. Getty 6/42 Lupita Nyong'o In an op-ed for The New York Times, the Oscar-winning actor said she was invited to Weinstein\u2019s family home in Connecticut on the premise of watching a film shortly after they met in 2011. But she said shortly after it started he \"insisted\" in front of his children that she follow him and she was led to his bedroom. The Kenyan-Mexican actress, now 34, said she felt pressured into giving him a massage after he offered her one. \"Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants,\" she wrote.\"I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable.

She declined and reportedly complained of his behaviour to colleagues, who later passed the information on to senior executives. An internal Weinstein Company document cited by the Times describes Nestor\u2019s encounter with Weinstein as follows: \u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour\u201d Getty 14/42 Ambra Battilana In March 2015, Battilana, an aspiring model and actress, was reportedly summoned to Weinstein\u2019s office on a Friday night to discuss her career.

The Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, later declined to press charges, and according to the Times, \u201cmade a payment\u201d to Battilana. On 5 October, the International Business Times reported that after Vance dropped the charges, he received $10,000 from Weinstein\u2019s lawyer 15/42 Lauren O\u2019Connor Lauren O\u2019Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company, penned a memo to executives alleging \u201ca toxic environment for women\u201d at the company.

When she approached the door, the producer reportedly greeted her dressed in just a dressing gown. \u201cI was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAfter declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.\u201d Theo Wargo/Getty Images 17/42 Gwyneth Paltrow The actor alleges that after he cast her in the title role of the film Emma when she was 22, he took her to his hotel room, placed his hands on her and suggested massages. \u201cI was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\u201d Paltrow told the New York Times.

When she was initially invited to a meeting with Weinstein, Judd said, she was surprised to learn the producer was in his hotel room - a tactic that recurs in other womens\u2019 accounts. Echoing the accounts of other women, Judd said Weinstein suggested she give him a massage and then invited her to watch him shower.

The Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, later declined to press charges, and according to the Times, \u201cmade a payment\u201d to Battilana. On 5 October, the International Business Times reported that after Vance dropped the charges, he received $10,000 from Weinstein\u2019s lawyer 15/42 Lauren O\u2019Connor Lauren O\u2019Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company, penned a memo to executives alleging \u201ca toxic environment for women\u201d at the company. The memo cited numerous incidents of Weinstein harassing or coercing women who worked for him. She expressed fear that Weinstein was using her and other female employees to \u201cfacilitate liaisons with \u2018vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.\u2019\u201d That same year, Weinstein allegedly reached a settlement with O\u2019Connor Getty 16/42 Kate Beckinsale The actor, who starred in the Weinstein Company films Serendipity and The Aviator, alleges that she was invited to Weinstein\u2019s hotel room at the age of just 17. When she approached the door, the producer reportedly greeted her dressed in just a dressing gown. \u201cI was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAfter declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.\u201d Theo Wargo/Getty Images 17/42 Gwyneth Paltrow The actor alleges that after he cast her in the title role of the film Emma when she was 22, he took her to his hotel room, placed his hands on her and suggested massages. \u201cI was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\u201d Paltrow told the New York Times. Rex Features 18/42 Asia Argento Italian actress Asia Argento has alleged that in 1997 Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her as she repeatedly told him to stop. \u201cWhen I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak,\u201d Argento told The New Yorker. \u201cAfter the rape, he won\u201d.

AFP/Getty 20/42 Ashley Judd Ashley Judd said she rebuffed Harvey Weinstein\u2019s unwanted sexual advances by offering to consent only after she had won an Oscar. When she was initially invited to a meeting with Weinstein, Judd said, she was surprised to learn the producer was in his hotel room - a tactic that recurs in other womens\u2019 accounts. Echoing the accounts of other women, Judd said Weinstein suggested she give him a massage and then invited her to watch him shower. After a \u201cvolley of no\u2019s\u201d she said she would only after she wins an Oscar, fleeing after making the comments. Reuters/Mike Segar 21/42 Judith Godr\u00e8che French actress Judith Godr\u00e8che said when she was 24 Weinstein invited her to his hotel room and asked to give her a massage. \u201cThe next thing I know, he\u2019s pressing against me and pulling off my sweater,\u201d she told the New York Times. Rex Features 22/42 Mira Sorvino The Oscar-winning actor said she found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein in 1995 where \u201che started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around.\u201d According to an interview in The New Yorker Weinstein subsequently arrived at her apartment late at night and she had to call a friend to come over to pose as her boyfriend in order to get Weinstein out of the house. Rex Features 23/42 Katherine Kendall The actress said Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room when she was just 23. She subsequently felt that telling others meant \u201cI\u2019ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,\u201d she told the New York Times. WireImage 24/42 Tomi-Anne Roberts As an aspiring actress and working in a restaurant in New York, Tomi-Ann Roberts encountered Weinstein who encouraged her to audition for one of his films back in 1984.

She said she left feeling manipulated. 25/42 Myleen Klass It has also been alleged that the disgraced film producer propositioned Myleene Klass with a \u201csex contract\u201d at Cannes Film Festival in 2010.

Getty Images 26/42 Sophie Dix Sophie Dix, best known for her role as Captain Sadie Williams in Soldier Soldier, described her encounter with Weinstein when she was 23 as \u201cthe single most damaging thing that\u2019s happened in my life\u201d. She told The Guardian Weinstein had pushed her to her bed and was \u201ctugging at her clothes\u201d. She rushed to the bathroom to escape, but when she came out she found him \u201cstanding there masturbating\u201d. \u201cI quickly closed the door again and locked it,\u201d she said. \u201cThen when I heard room service come to the door I just ran.\u201d Rex 27/42 L\u00e9a Seydoux The actor and director claims she had to fight off Weinstein after he brought her to his hotel room during what she remembers to be 2012. \u201cHe suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He\u2019s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted,\u201d she wrote in The Guardian. AFP/Getty Images 28/42 Claire Forlani British actress Claire Forlani wrote on Twitter that she had evaded Weinstein\u2019s advances on five occasions at the age of 25.

Mark Douet 29/42 Florence Darel French actress Florence Darel claimed Weinstein relentlessly pursued her in the mid 1990's and propositioned her while Eve Chilton, his wife at the time, was in the hotel room next door. \u201cI was astonished,\u201d she told People magazine. \u201cWhen you have someone so physically disgusting in front of you, continuing and continuing as though this was all perfectly normal\u2026 What happened to me may not be illegal but it was inappropriate. Very inappropriate.\u201d Getty 30/42 Lysette Anthony Lysette Anthony, who starred as Marnie Nightingale in Hollyoaks, has claimed Weinstein raped her in the late 1980's after turning up to her London home in the late 1980\u2019s.

Getty 31/42 Dawn Dunning Dunning said she met Weinstein in 2003 when she was 24-years-old and the disgraced film producer suggested she have a threesome with him and someone else.

Rex Features 32/42 Rosanna Arquette Rosanna Arquette was already well known for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan, when she said she met Weinstein at his hotel to pick up a script in the early nineties. Weinstein was dressed only in a dressing gown, and tried to put her hand on his erect penis. Speaking to the New York Times, Arquette said as she left she told him: \u201cI will never be that girl.\u201d Rex Features 33/42 Emma de Caunes Caunes, a French actor, claimed Weinstein took her to his hotel room in 2010 supposedly to retrieve a book he was making into a film, but once there he went into the bathroom.

Rex Features 34/42 Zoe Brock Model Zoe claimed that she had to lock herself in a bathroom at Weinstein\u2019s hotel in 1997, after the mogul had sent all of the assistants out of the room, and then appeared naked. \u201cI was alone with Weinstein, she told ITV\u2019s This Morning programme. \u201cHe very quickly left the room and came back naked. He chased me naked.\u201d 35/42 Jessica Barth Actress Jessica Barth described an encounter with Weinstein in 2011 in an interview with The New Yorker in which she said Weinstein veered between offering her roles in films and demanding a naked massage. She alleges the producer said to her: \u201cSo, what would happen if, say, we\u2019re having some champagne and I take my clothes off and you give me a massage?\u201d When she tried to leave, he then promised to give her the number of a female executive at the company. \u201cHe gave me her number, and I walked out and I started bawling,\u201d Barth said.

Getty 37/42 Heather Graham Graham claimed that during a casting opportunity in the early 2000's Weinstein had told her he had an open relationship with his wife. \u201cHe could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy,\u201d Graham told Variety. \u201cThere was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there.\u201d Graham was never hired to work in a Weinstein film. Rex Features 38/42 Jessica Hynes Spaced and W1A star Jessica Hynes tweeted about an encounter with Weinstein earlier this week, but subsequently deleted the tweet. Rex Features 39/42 Lucia Evans The actor told The New Yorker that after a meeting to discuss casting her in various projects, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. \u201cI said, over and over, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, stop, don\u2019t\u2019.\u201d She added: \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. He overpowered me. I just sort of gave up. That\u2019s the most horrible part of it, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to do this for so long to so many women: people give up, and then they feel like it\u2019s their fault.\u201d Getty 40/42 Louisette Geiss The former actress said she met Weinstein to pitch a film script she was working on. During the meeting, Weinstein allegedly went out and reappeared naked and got into a jacuzzi where he masturbated in front of her and said he would make the script into a film if she stayed and watched.

Rex Features 42/42 Louise Godbold Writing in a blog post, Louise Godbold, a non-profit director in Los Angeles, said her encounter with Weinstein took the form of an \u201coffice tour that became an occasion to trap me in an empty meeting room. She said then Weinstein was \u201cbegging for a massage, his hands on my shoulders as I attempted to beat a retreat.\u201d\n\nAs well as including accounts from those who knew Weinstein, the documentary also features anecdotes from journalists who worked to expose the story, including The New Yorker\u2019s investigative reporter Ronan Farrow.\n\nHe says: \u201cI was being told, \u2018You still need more women, these women are crazy, you need more credible women.\u2019 Over and over again, no matter how many women were saying this was happening to them.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Here are the testimonies we hear in the documentary\u2026\n\nRosanna Arquette\n\n\u201cHe grabbed my hand and he had an erection and I went, \u2018F***\u2019 and backed up. He went, \u2018Rosanna, you\u2019re making a very big mistake.\u2019 I knew I was going to be in trouble because I didn\u2019t participate, I knew it, and then when I tried to tell people they said, \u2018You better keep your mouth shut.\u2019\u201d\n\nErika Rosenbaum\n\n\u201cHe came out of the bathroom and he wasn\u2019t wearing any pants, just a shirt that covered his hips. I was very put off as you can imagine and also just nervous because he was clearly distraught about something that had nothing to do with my presence there.\n\n\u201cSo right away I said, \u2018It\u2019s a bad time, I can see you\u2019re on your way out, let\u2019s do this another day.\u2019 And I backed towards the door. And he got quite annoyed and said, \u2018You\u2019re here, take the five minutes and let\u2019s talk for a second.\u2019 He said, \u2018Come with me.\u2019 And he asked me to follow him to the bathroom. I said, \u2018No, please, this is not a good time I\u2019ll come back.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026 I stayed because I thought leaving would be worse, I followed him into the wash room. The toilet seat had been broken like it had been smashed\u2026 there was blood on the seat. He asked me to face the mirror and said, \u2018I just want to look at you.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe put his hand on the back of my neck and held me in place, staring at my own face in the mirror. He started to touch himself under his shirt behind me. I remember that like it\u2019s a scene from a bad movie, because it\u2019s hard to believe that was me\u2026\n\n\u201cI remember staring at him and thinking, \u2018If I can just stand still maybe it will all go away or maybe I will disappear.\u2019 I was too shocked to move. I noticed he had blood on his hand. I found a way to say I had to go. I don\u2019t think he finished.\u201d\n\nPaz de la Huerta\u200b\n\n\u201cI was intimidated by him and his power. He\u2019s a repulsive man physically. I saw these other actresses hanging around him so I felt like it was something you did, he asked me if I wanted a ride home and I said, \u2018Okay.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Can we have a drink upstairs at yours?\u2019 And I was too afraid to say no. We went up to my place and things got very uncomfortable very fast. He pulled my dress up I was just terrified, I didn\u2019t kick or scream. When you read about rape you read \u2018The girl screams no and kicks and screams\u2019 but that\u2019s not exactly right. The way in which he overpowered me left me no way out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I was hovering over my body and this thing was happening to me. I didn\u2019t go to the police because I was terrified he would destroy me and he would say it was consensual, and that I was a whore and I was lying.\n\n\u201cYou put on a happy face but inside you\u2019re dying. It made me feel like I had to reclaim my sexuality so I wanted to do photoshoots where I could feel beautiful and take it back, take back what I believe he stole from me\u2026\n\n\u201cI wanted to feel desirable again, people knew that this pig had violated me, that this monster had been inside me.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Dulany\u200b\n\n\u201cHarvey performed oral sex on me forcibly, or without my consent, I didn\u2019t know what to do and I was terrified he was going to rape me. I was really scared of being of being penetrated, of being raped, of having him on top of me, so I just froze. I definitely went somewhere else. I thought, \u2018This is happening and it\u2019s going to be over and I\u2019ll cut it out of me somehow.\u2019 He masturbated and finished.\u201d\n\nHope d\u2019Amore\u200b\n\n\u201cI put on a T shirt and some shorts or something to sleep in and I went to bed. Suddenly Harvey gets into bed naked next to me\u2026 I just pushed him away. He tries to cajole at first: \u2018Do you really want to make me an enemy for five minutes of your time?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe just pushed and pushed and then, he just, he\u2019s huge, I weigh about 100 pounds, probably about 110 then. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, I just thought, \u2018If I just shut up it will be over in a few minutes.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want anything from him. I didn\u2019t hit him. I didn\u2019t try to scratch his eyes out. But I said \u2018No\u2019 and I pushed him away, more than once, and then I just stopped. I was so frightened.\n\n\u201cI went back to Buffalo, I didn\u2019t tell anybody. I knew he used to say he owned the cops in Buffalo because they worked concerts, they worked security when they were off duty. He had influence, he had a lot of money, he did a lot of advertising in newspapers, nobody would have believed anything I said. I wasn\u2019t going to go to anybody and complain about that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the collateral damage, what it does to the relationships with friends, people you love and they don\u2019t know why. It steals something.\u201d\n\nZelda Perkins\n\nAssistant at Miramax London\n\n\u201cAs an assistant you had to get him up in the morning which usually would mean there was a tussle at the bedside. He showered, he expected you to be around when he was naked. He very quickly tried to normalise the situation and just told me I had to get with it and not be such a prissy and he didn\u2019t have time to worry about my delicate feelings.\n\n\u201cAt 23 in your first job you believe what they tell you, so I was like, okay, I\u2019m now in the big league and of course he\u2019s really important. He doesn\u2019t have time to do things like wear trousers when he\u2019s tired. The first time he asked for a massage I was very robust and I was always pretty cheeky and rude back to him which would make him laugh, so I didn\u2019t feel frightened, but it was mentally exhausting because you were always slightly fighting, it felt like you were always keeping your head above water.\u201d\n\nTalking about an incident involving her colleague, Perkins adds:\n\n\u201cI had recently employed an assistant to help me with Harvey. When I was interviewing people I very clearly said, \u2018He will behave inappropriately. If you deal with him robustly you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 Because that was my experience. That evening my colleague did the night shift, it was her first time with him alone and he assaulted her and attempted to rape her, which she told me the next day. I think it was probably one of the most shattering bits of news I\u2019d ever had.\n\n\u201cSo I immediately went and confronted Harvey. He told me nothing and he then swore on his wife, who was Eve at the time, and his children\u2019s lives, which to me I\u2019m afraid was an absolute admission of guilt because I\u2019d heard him only do that as a proper get out of jail card, that was his \u2018I\u2019m in trouble\u2019 lie.\u201d\n\nNannette Klatt\n\n\u201cI had gotten an audition and was going in to read for a part, he handed me the script and said, \u2018You think you can read those four pages for me?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, yes I\u2019d be happy to.\u2019 I was so happy because all I could think of is, \u2018Yes! This is the launching of my career. I\u2019m going to be working for a huge major studio, a huge person in the industry, thank you god.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2019Wait a minute, wait a minute,\u2019 he said. \u2018I need one more thing from you. I want to see your breasts.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s your breasts,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You know I can make your career or break your career? I can make it so you never work in this business again. Show me your breasts.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t do that.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018The building\u2019s locked, you can\u2019t get out that way, you can\u2019t get out at all. You should go down there.\u2019 And he pointed past him down the end of a hall where there was a stairwell door. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to come in looking for me, he knows I have total night blindness so he knew when I went down those stairs it was totally black, totally, totally black.\u201d\n\nUntouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein airs at 9pm on Sunday 1 September on BBC2", "description": "Almost two years after the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story detailing decades of allegations of rape and sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein broke, the \u201cdefinitive\u201d documentary tracking his meteoric rise and monstrous downfall arrives on BBC2.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/16/17997382-high-res-untouchable-the-rise-and-fall-of-harvey-weinstein.jpg"}
