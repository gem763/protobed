The Abrams camp sides more with Democrats who want to drive turnout among nonwhites and suburban or urban college-educated whites. Those constituencies could put states like Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona in play while helping in Trump\u2019s Upper Midwest footprint.\n\nGeorgia has added 2020 emphasis because both of its Senate seats are on the ballot, including a surprise special election because Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson is retiring, along with two competitive suburban Atlanta congressional districts key to determining House control.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, did not put a price tag on a 2020 campaign in Georgia, but noted the combined Democratic investment in Georgia last year was $42 million, compared to $70 million in Ohio and $32 million in Iowa, where Democrats lost statewide midterm races two years after Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by nearly double-digit margins.\n\nAbrams\u2019 play Monday also underscores her mounting influence in the party. She was a rising star in her campaign against now-Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. After her loss, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York tapped her to deliver Democrats\u2019 response to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address and tried unsuccessfully to coax her into challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in 2020.\n\nIn recent months, Abrams, 45, has met with at least nine Democratic presidential candidates and launched a drive for voter protection hotlines in 20 states while enjoying speculation that she\u2019ll be on any nominee\u2019s short list for vice president \u2014 particularly if former Vice President Joe Biden, a 76-year-old white man, wins the nomination. Central to Biden\u2019s candidacy is his perceived appeal with white moderates and swing voters who voted for Trump in those Midwestern battlegrounds.\n\nIn the packet sent Monday, Abrams took pains to say she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cdiminish the importance or winnability of any state,\u201d and the memo, which Groh-Wargo wrote, said Democrats should reject \u201cfalse choices\u201d between chasing white Obama-Trump voters and Democratic-leaning minorities who are considered unlikely voters.\n\nBut the documents laid out the case that Democrats\u2019 greatest potential gains are found in the latter groups.\n\nIn 2018, Abrams got more than 1.92 million votes, about 45,000 more than Clinton, but 55,000 shy of Kemp\u2019s 1.98 million. Republicans had been winning statewide races by about 200,000 votes, with the GOP\u2019s presidential totals stabilizing between 2 million and 2.1 million since 2008 while Democratic totals climbed.\n\nThe shift is mostly about demographics: Georgia\u2019s nonwhite population is growing faster than its native white population. Its electorate is now about one-third African American, a higher proportion than any perennial presidential battleground.\n\nGroh-Wargo wrote that Abrams was able to take advantage because the campaign spent time and money reaching irregular voters. With new registrations since 2018, Groh-Wargo put the number of such voters for 2020 at 1.7 million \u2014 more than six times the GOP\u2019s typical advantage in Georgia and 30 times larger than Abrams\u2019 margin of defeat last year.\n\nThe universe of truly persuadable \u201cswing voters\u201d in Georgia, comparatively, is about 150,000, Groh-Wargo said. The campaign spent money targeting those voters, she added, but not nearly as much as traditional campaign tactics would have required for television advertising in the expensive Atlanta market.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have narrowed GOP margins with urban and suburban whites through a combination of new residents moving in and some realignment, as in other states, among college-educated white women disenchanted with Trump. Rural whites have moved even more overwhelmingly to Republicans, though Groh-Wargo called it a \u201cmyth\u201d that Abrams didn\u2019t campaign to rural whites. In aggregate, Groh-Wargo, Abrams still garnered more of the white vote in 2018 than other recent Democrats at the top of the Georgia ticket.\n\nThe takeaway in 2020, Groh-Wargo said, is Democrats\u2019 messaging, infrastructure, advertising and one-on-one outreach cannot be focused on a narrow universe of swing voters and erstwhile Democrats who aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\u201cDemocratic committees, consultants and the media do not factor unlikely voters into their polling, strategy and prognostications,\u201d Groh-Wargo said, instead \u201crel-itigating the prior election as if nothing had changed in the electorate since.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP", "description": "The former Georgia gubernatorial candidate made her case in a letter and strategy memo obtained by The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7727923b00002b88d0c41b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
