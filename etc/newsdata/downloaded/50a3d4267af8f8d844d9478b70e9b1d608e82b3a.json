But the mother's photos are especially tragic: They show the heartbreaking devastation of addiction on her oldest son, Cody Bishop.\n\n\u201cThe face of heroin and meth \u2026 is reality for so many people and families in the world today,\u201d Salfen-Tracy wrote on Facebook. \u201cI have learned along this path that so many people and families deal with the same heartache but just do not talk about it.\u201d\n\nTaken only seven months apart, the first picture of Bishop shows a healthy young man with broad shoulders, a muscular build and blond hair. The later photo reveals what looks like the ghost of the first man. Bishop still has the telltale blond hair but he is emaciated, his collarbones poke out of a tank top and sores cover his skin.\n\nWhile Salfen-Tracy is not only concerned by her son\u2019s sickly appearance, she's consumed by worry because she has lost touch with him.\n\n\u201cCody is still homeless in Las Vegas and I have not heard from him in weeks now. Hearing how bad he is doing is hard but not hearing at all is worse. The unknown is what makes a person not sleep at night. It is hard to understand how someone who has families and children who love and need them live the life they do,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.\n\nSalfen-Tracy is sharing her pain and frustration as a way to raise awareness about addiction.\n\n\"This is a true issue in our world today that we need to pull together and focus on to fix,\" she wrote.\n\nThe post has gone viral with 41,000 reactions to it, 18,000 comments and 46,000 shares. While many people offered prayers and encouragement, others shared stories about their own loved ones grappling with addiction. One woman explained that she lost her husband to heroin.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what I could have done to change the outcome,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cI pray your son sees the light and love you are offering and goes to rehab.\"\n\nAnother woman noted she and Salfen-Tracy have something in common: Both have sons struggling with addiction that they can\u2019t find.\n\n\u201cI have a son that\u2019s out there on heroin. And he\u2019s been missing for a month now. I\u2019m tired of worrying but I can\u2019t help myself not knowing if he is dead or alive,\u201d she said.\n\nAmerica is caught in a terrible epidemic of addiction and drug overdose deaths. Almost 1 million Americans had a methamphetamine use disorder in 2016 and heroin use has been on the rise in the U.S. since 2007, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nSalfen-Tracy thanks the people she\u2019s met that knew Bishop and have tried to help him and urges the nation to address addiction before ending with a personal plea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a hold of this issue America and help each other. Thanks again for everyone\u2019s love and support. And, Cody if you see this please call us,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe love you!\u201d", "description": "Jennifer Salfen-Tracy shared before and after picture of son Cody Bishop's addiction to heroin and the pain she feels.
