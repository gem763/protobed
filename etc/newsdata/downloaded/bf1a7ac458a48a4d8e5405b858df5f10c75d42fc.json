Jerrold Nadler and Doug Collins, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, respectively, announced legislation Wednesday that would \u201cfix\u201d the tortuous process in current law.\n\nThe issue flared up over the summer when Homeland Security announced it had been operating outside the law, and was changing its policy to comply. Though the change only affected a tiny universe of people \u2014 perhaps several dozen a year \u2014 it spawned inaccurate headlines accusing the Trump administration of denying military families birthright citizenship.\n\nThe new bill clears up any confusion.\n\n\u201cAmerican citizens who are deployed members of our military or government officials working abroad should have confidence their children will receive U.S. citizenship,\u201d said Mr. Collins.\n\nThe change would apply to a case where a U.S. citizen adult working for the government is stationed overseas and adopts a child. Under the law, those government employees, during that duty, are not considered \u201cresiding\u201d in the U.S. for purposes of acquiring citizenship.\n\nFor someone who gained citizenship at birth from American parents, but lived outside the U.S. their whole life, they would not have enough residency for an adopted child to automatically be considered a citizen.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had been ignoring that complicated situation and had considered those children citizens. But the State Department was more closely following the law and would not issue them U.S. passports.\n\nUSCIS made the decision to conform to the law and the State Department\u2019s operations. The agency said military families did have other avenues for obtaining citizenship for their children.\n\nUSCIS said over the summer that perhaps 20 to 25 persons a year are affected.\n\nThe change pushed by Mr. Nadler and Mr. Collins would put military and other government families on the same path as everyone else.\n\n\u201cThis small but important change is the least we can do for the men and women who serve our country in the U.S. armed forces and in federal government positions overseas,\u201d Mr. Nadler said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
