On October 24, Facebook founder and Turing Test dropout Mark Zuckerberg testified to U.S. Congress for five hours about the cryptocurrency that Facebook wants to launch next year \u2014 but which now might never launch at all. Here\u2019s what went down.\n\nWhat was this hearing about?\n\nZuckerberg appeared before the 62-member United States House Committee on Financial Services, for a hearing titled \u201cAn Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.\u201d Representatives mostly focused on Libra, data privacy, Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing disinformation in political ads, and the company\u2019s violation of housing anti-discrimination laws.\n\nReal quick, what\u2019s Libra again?\n\nLibra is Facebook\u2019s would-be cryptocurrency, aimed at making international online payments frictionless, fee-free, and available to people around the world without bank accounts. Facebook announced it this June and wants to launch it in 2020.\n\nIn crypto terms, Libra is a stablecoin, since it would be pegged to existing government currencies (half U.S. dollars, plus a variety of currencies and \u201clow-risk assets,\u201d all still under discussion.)\n\nIt\u2019s technically not just Facebook\u2019s. Facebook is one of several founding members of the Libra Association, which is based in the global financial centre of Geneva, Switzerland. But everyone agrees that Facebook is the de facto controller of the operation, and that the U.S. government is the one it has to please.\n\nPlus Facebook entirely owns Calibra, a digital wallet for holding your Libra coins. What a confusing combination of names! Anyway, other people can also make wallets, but Calibra will probably be the default, and only cool nerds will use someone else\u2019s wallet.\n\nFacebook\u2019s stated goal is to enable billions of unbanked people to access digital payments for the first time, in underdeveloped or unstable places like Venezuela and India, as well as their friends, family, and business contacts in more developed countries.\n\nWhat happened up to now?\n\nLibra\u2019s in trouble. Since Facebook announced it this June, things haven\u2019t gone well. Seven of the 27 other partners backed out earlier this month, including Visa, MasterCard, eBay, Stripe and PayPal, before the Libra Association\u2019s first meeting, but just after senators sent them letters boiling down to \u201cYou are entering a world of pain.\u201d Zuckerberg spent Thursday in that world.\n\nPreviously, the Financial Services committee questioned David Marcus, CEO of Calibra. Zuckerberg has testified before other Congressional committees before, but this is his first hearing since Facebook announced Libra.\n\nDemocrats on the Financial Services committee are developing a \u201cKeep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\u201d that would explicitly prohibit large tech companies from acting as financial institutions or issuing currencies, so Zuckerberg knew he was talking to politicians who want to stop Libra from happening.\n\nThe Bank of England, central bank for the UK, announced rules that Libra would need to follow, while the EU finance commissioner announced he would create new regulations for Libra and other crypto.\n\nFacebook has said repeatedly that it wants to play by the rules, and that it will get regulatory approval in the U.S. before launching Libra. But this statement, as several representatives pointed out today, is more ambiguous than it sounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s the U.S. government\u2019s problem with Libra?\n\nIs Libra money? Would that make Facebook a bank? The government\u2014or at least the Democrats on the committee, plus some Republicans and Donald Trump\u2014think so. They believe Facebook is trying to avoid the regulations that govern existing financial institutions.\n\nWhat happened at the hearing?\n\nThe entire five-hour hearing, led by committee chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), is on video here. I\u2019ll break it down in slightly less than five hours. Let\u2019s talk about the Libra discussion first.\n\nIs Facebook competing with the U.S. government?\n\nFacebook says they want to be regulated, but by whom? Zuckerberg told Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) that Libra shouldn\u2019t be regulated as a bank, or by the SEC. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) asked Zuckerberg if a Calibra wallet is like a bank account. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bank,\u201d Zuck replied. \u201cWe\u2019re not applying for a bank charter.\u201d Perlmutter interrupted: \u201cThat\u2019s the problem!\u201d\n\nZuckerberg calls Libra a \u201cpayment system.\u201d Several representatives don\u2019t see it that way: Why not just make a coin that fully follows the dollar? (Chris Dixon, who heads the crypto fund at Libra partner Andreessen Horowitz, has suggested pegging Libra to the dollar alone.)\n\nWhat do they care? Because it threatens the dollar\u2019s supremacy. Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Penn.) called Libra a \u201cshadow currency that would operate more like a government.\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) pointed to the dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s main reserve currency, and said this demand for dollars is profitable for the U.S. Treasury, and thus for tax-paying Americans.\n\nCrypto lawyer Felix Shipkevich, principal at Shipkevich PLLC, tells Lifehacker that financial institutions are so heavily regulated because otherwise they threaten to usurp the role of government. When people buy Libra coins, they\u2019re handing over their local currency. What happens, for example, if Libra is a huge hit in Venezuela, and Facebook ends up owning 10 per cent of the bolivar? Facebook would be heavily invested in the success of Venezuela, and vice versa. What happens, he says, if Facebook becomes too big to fail?\n\nConcerns about Facebook\u2019s international currency exposure weren\u2019t raised at the hearing, but representatives pressured Zuckerberg about the choice\u2014his choice, as they see it\u2014to base Libra in Switzerland. Why not in the good old U.S. of A., where Facebook is based, along with its biggest (ex-)partners? (Facebook, like many U.S.-based companies including Google and Apple, \u201cbases\u201d its international operations in Ireland to avoid U.S. taxes. Unlike Google and Apple, it does not operate in China.)\n\nIs Facebook in charge of Libra?\n\nZuckerberg kept insisting that Facebook is just part of a larger group controlling the currency\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re a part of it, we don\u2019t control it.\u201d Representatives kept insisting that oh come on, we all know you\u2019re in charge.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) pointed out that Zuckerberg has a controlling vote in Facebook, and that Facebook has control of Libra: \u201cLibra is Facebook, and Facebook is you.\u201d\n\nRep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) said Zuckerberg could move the association to the U.S. if he wanted. When someone said that Zuck \u201ccontrols\u201d Calibra CEO Marcus, Zuck laughed and said well, Marcus is his employee, but \u201ccontrol\u201d is strong. Cute, but not really a rebuttal.\n\nMore Libra concerns\n\nCongress is troubled by the prospect of end-to-end encryption enabling illegal transactions, particularly money laundering, funding of terrorism, and sex trafficking. Zuckerberg wouldn\u2019t commit to any safety measures that could hobble the frictionless, I.D.-less process of buying and selling Libra\u2014and that\u2019s the problem. Rep. Sherman lit into Zuckerberg and Libra in a West Wing-level rant:\n\nYou\u2019re gonna be making powerful burglary tools, and letting your business partners commit a burglary. You\u2019re going to create a currency\u2026I call it the Zuckbuck\u2026and say \u2018Oh, it\u2019s our business partners!\u2019\u2026The poor and unbanked need pesos, they need dollars, so they can buy something at a local store. You\u2019ve done no effort to help the unbanked anywhere else, at any other time. You should, you should create a payment system with a close-to-zero fee. But the real money is in the tax evaders, to some extent the drug dealers\u2026.For the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world, and say that\u2019s who you\u2019re trying to help? You\u2019re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency: the drug dealers, terrorists, and tax evaders.\n\nZuckerberg said multiple times that Libra isn\u2019t primarily about making money for Facebook. But it doesn\u2019t really matter if that\u2019s true. Facebook\u2019s Calibra plans to avoid fees\u2014but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a loss leader. It\u2019s become obvious that a free valuable digital service will have other, more insidious costs. What Congress fears is that Libra will be worse for the world than transaction fees.\n\nWhy are all these questions from Democrats?\n\nU.S. Republican representatives were a lot friendlier to Zuckerberg. Their main narrative was that the world needs a U.S.-friendly competitor to China\u2019s planned state-backed cryptocurrency, which is exactly what Zuckerberg said in his prepared statement. (Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Oh., rejected this \u201cLibra vs. China\u201d framing.)\n\nThey also helped Zuckerberg repeat his main talking point: The current financial system is stagnant, and even if Facebook isn\u2019t the \u201cideal\u201d entity to shake it up, someone has to. And they\u2019re the ones with the resources to kindly bestow this gift upon the world.\n\nThere\u2019s truth here, of course; existing financial institutions are greedy and corrupt, and regulations don\u2019t stop them from repeatedly endangering the world economy. They underserve the poor, except to squeeze more money out of them. While the answer isn\u2019t necessarily a new cryptocurrency controlled by one of the few institutions worth more than any bank, it\u2019s not like the status quo is in line with Democratic values. Which is why it was weird to see Republicans supporting the guy who wants to fight the banks, and Democrats telling him to stop.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg overreached, implying (by way of gentle denial) that Libra wants to build a whole new financial system to replace the old one, Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) tried to cover for him. Even the Republicans\u2019 support was trying to frame Libra as not so big a deal.\n\nRepublicans did have some issues, but these frequently spilled outside the discussion of Libra.\n\nWhat happened besides Libra?\n\nBecause Facebook is involved in every part of public and private life, there\u2019s a lot that Congress wants to say to it.\n\nThis is where Republicans were more worried. Multiple representatives complained about Facebook censoring speech\u2014leading Zuckerberg to say Facebook doesn\u2019t censor legally permissible speech (other than sexual activity, which no one mentioned), only de-emphasise it with tactics like demoted search results, labels attached to known disinformation sites, and algorithmic ranking.\n\nRep. Bill Posey (R-Fl.) asked why Facebook was censoring posts on the dangers of vaccinations. (It\u2019s not.) In other words, Florida Man Goes Anti-Vax.\n\nDemocrats, of course, are worried Facebook is allowing too much speech\u2014specifically disinformation from political ads, which Facebook recently declared that it wouldn\u2019t fact-check. The committee was not pleased.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez put it best when she asked specifically which lies she could tell in political ads. Zuckerberg said no, she couldn\u2019t pay to target black neighbourhoods and tell them the wrong election date, because Facebook would ban disenfranchising or vote-suppressing ads.\n\nThen Ocasio-Cortez asked if she could run an ad against Republicans in primaries, claiming they voted for the Green New Deal. Zuck mumbled, \u201cI think probably.\u201d\n\nRemarkable. Zuckerberg tells @AOC that he DOES NOT KNOW if she could run ads in a GOP primary saying one of the candidates supports the Green New Deal What @AOC is doing is breaking down the distinction Facebook is trying to make between \"fact checking\" and \"voter suppression\" https://t.co/fhKTisgEJX \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 23, 2019\n\nThe hearing\u2019s stated scope included housing discrimination violations, and these were not neglected. Several representatives yelled at Facebook (again) for letting housing advertisers illegally target ads by race and other protected classes. They quizzed Zuckerberg on civil rights and the diversity of his own teams, and what sounded like gotcha questions ended up proving that he was pathetically unprepared to talk about his own company\u2019s biggest legal violations and what it\u2019s doing to fix them.\n\nThe most blistering 2 minutes from today\u2019s Facebook hearing (supposedly about Libra) is Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH) absolutions lighting in to Zuckerberg (and Sheryl Sandberg) about civil rights pic.twitter.com/4cd28Tyg2O \u2014 Marcus Gilmer (@marcusgilmer) October 23, 2019\n\nRep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) described dismal conditions for the Facebook content monitors who crawl through the frequently disturbing banned content on the site, with just nine minutes a day designated for emotional coping. She asked Zuck to volunteer to spend an hour a day for a year as a content monitor (like his past year-long projects). He said it didn\u2019t seem like a good use of his time.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of anger over the Cambridge Analytica data breach, so that came up a few times, especially to question Facebook\u2019s ability to securely manage people\u2019s money. (Fun fact, Cambridge Analytica dabbled in its own cryptocurrency, which was supposed to \u201chelp people store and sell their online personal data.\u201d)\n\nAlso Zuck asked Maxine Waters for a pee break.\n\nActual quote: \"Can we have a break after this next round [...] after the next five minutes? I'm up here, I'm drinking a lot of water...\" \u2014 Nick Douglas (@toomuchnick) October 23, 2019\n\nWhat will happen now?\n\nRep. Sherman predicted the next step in his bullshit-cutting speech: \u201c[You say] you\u2019re going to wait for regulators to sign off. Regulators are working with old statutes. Your lawyers are gonna show that there\u2019s a loophole in the 1940 Investment Company Act that gets you where you want to go, and the regulators can\u2019t stop you. You\u2019re gonna call that regulatory approval, as if the people in 1940 knew what you had in mind.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBut not if the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act passes, specifically targeted at Facebook (and at any competitors like Amazon that toy with their own competing coins).\n\nNot if Libra compromises, and governments are happy with a compromise like multiple cryptocurrencies, each tied to an existing currency.\n\nAnd not if Facebook and its remaining partners get so sick of fighting governments that they give up, and Facebook looks for a different way to make itself the financial layer that you just can\u2019t afford not to use.\n\nBecause until governments take heavy anti-trust actions against tech giants, like breaking up Facebook as presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren plans\u2014and breaking up Amazon and Google while we\u2019re at it\u2014these heirs of Ma Bell and Standard Oil will continue to swallow the world. Maybe some people will be better off that way. Will you?", "description": "Libra season is over.
