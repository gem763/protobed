And that recovered progress left production for the first three quarters of 2019 at 243 million tonnes, which is just 3 per cent below the 2018 performance.\n\nIn short then, a repeat of the September production and shipments effort would see Rio glide ever so slightly beyond the upper end of the 2019 forecast range.\n\nThat performance is given further gloss by the fact that it was generated from a mine system that was in the opening phase of the review and redesign that was flagged when Rio trimmed its outlook in June and inconvenienced by about two weeks of heavy duty rail track maintenance.\n\nIt is creditable too that material volume rehab occurred while work on new mines (Koodaideri) and sustaining projects across the Robe River system continued.\n\n'Alternate products'\n\nThe slightly less than good news though is that Rio\u2019s iron ore people have needed to cut a few quality corners to make sure it runs to guidance. And that, surely, stands a lingering embarrassment to a company whose mantra is value over volume.\n\nRio noted that its third quarter sales numbers included 6.7 million tonnes of \u201calternate products\u201d and that this trend to the alternative would extend into the December quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what are \u201calternate\u201d products?\n\nWell, we are assured that these are the \u201ccertain lower grade products\u201d that were identified in the fateful June announcement that signalled the mining plan lapses in the Greater Brockman.\n\nBack in June Rio excised an estimated 1.5 million tonnes of Greater Brockman production to protect the integrity of its Pilbara Blend, which is Australia\u2019s 62 per cent product, and flagged that \u201cadditional sales of these products will be made during 2019\u201d. They sure got that right.\n\nThrough the September quarter the volume of those \u201ccertain lower grade products\u201d seems to have grown more than four-fold.\n\nGiven 6.7 million tonnes is not an incidental volume \u2013 it is just shy of eight per cent of total shipments - we asked Rio on Wednesday for guidance on just how much lower the quality of this ore was and just where those volumes appeared in the overall production numbers.\n\nFrom what we understand, the quality of the \u201ccertain lower grade products\u201d is inconsistent and thus hard to make a call on beyond the fact that it isn\u2019t good enough to be fed into the Pilbara Blend mix.\n\nMore importantly, it seems that 6.7 million tonnes of \u201calternate products\u201d is accounted for in the Pilbara Blend fines production volumes number. If that is so, then this lower caste product \u2013 which surely must earn a discount of some kind or other from the 62 per cent benchmark \u2013 accounted for something more than 20 per cent of Pilbara Fines production through the September quarter.\n\nCombine that with the unhappy fact that the cost of recovery work has rendered Rio the highest cost Pilbara producer and you get a business that, temporarily at least, is not quite the value over volume iron ore monster that chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques wants it to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear on that, while competitors BHP and Fortescue are pushing below the $US13 a tonne level, Rio will this year add at least $UD1 a tonne to its Pilbara costs base, which is forecast to average $US14-$US15 a tonne.\n\nJust incidentally, Rio reconfirmed on Wednesday that the reshaping of its Pilbara mining plan, which requires uncovering more of its ore bodies and bringing forward the pit development schedule, would continue into 2020.\n\n\u201cOur increased focus on waste material movement and pit development will continue over 2019 and 2020 to improve mine performance and sequencing,\u201d Rio\u2019s September production report noted.\n\nThe good and the bad\n\nOutside of iron ore, Rio is a business of two very big pillars, copper and the aluminium chain. The company reported that copper is travelling nicely to plan with production on track to hit annual guidance of between 550-600,000 tonnes on the back of recovered grades at its 100 per cent owned Bingham Canyon mine in the US and improved throughput at its 30 per cent owned Escondida mine in Chile.\n\nProgress in aluminium and its raw materials has not run so smoothly with annual guidance trimmed across the board for reasons that demonstrate what a complicated thing a life in the legendary light metal can be.\n\nRio\u2019s forecast share of annual bauxite production was cut by up to five million tonnes to 54 million tonnes because of lower production from its Australian alumina refineries and because of constraints in Brazil forced first by environmental issues and then by a review of a broad community of tailings dams.\n\nForecast alumina production was trimmed by up to 700,000 tonnes to 7.7 million tonnes in part because of maintenance issues at the same refineries that reduced demand for Australian bauxite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd aluminium production will come in a the lower end of guidance (3.2 million tonnes) because a potline in Rio\u2019s Iceland smelter (ISAL) was turned off in the name of safety concerns.\n\nOn a much, much brighter note, it is interesting to note that Rio\u2019s quarterly exploration spend through the September quarter surged by 34 per cent to $US464 million on the back of increased commitment to the Resolution copper project in Arizona and Order of Magnitude studies in Australia and North America.\n\nAustralia back in the exploration race\n\nIt is that second driver that interests me. Order of Magnitude studies is an originating gateway for project development at Rio. It is the precursor of the pre-feasibility and feasibility work that hopefully leads to final investment decisions.\n\nFrom what we understand, the new projects adding weight to the Order of Magnitude spend at the Winu copper discovery in Australia\u2019s far north-west and a Canadian diamond discovery of two names \u2013 Rio calls it Falcon while its original owner (Star Diamonds) calls it Star Orion.\n\nCall me crazy but I am rather more interested in the Winu\u2019s copper potential than the diamond thing. For mine the Patterson Range discovery\u2019s rapid-fire progress into Rio\u2019s study stage is affirmation of recent commentary by growth & technology boss Stephen McIntosh.\n\nMcIntosh has predicted a more nimble and flexible future approach to project development by Rio Tinto and offered Winu\u2019s potential progress as an example to this new way.\n\nTo my mind, Winu along with BHP\u2019s one-drill copper and uranium find at Oak Dam in South Australia are lead indicators of a wider technology-led revival of base metals prospectivity in Australia.\n\nInterestingly, S &P Global\u2019s latest annual study of international mining\u2019s base metals exploration budgets seems to confirm this shift. The study reveals that, for the first time since 2001, investment in the search for non-ferrous metals in Australia outstripped that of Canada.\n\nExploration investment in Australia in 2019 will rise by $US199 million to $US1.53 billion while in Canada it has fallen by $US134 million to $US1.31 billion, according to S &P.\n\nAnd, just for good measure, the local exploration spend will outstrip the commitment in the US (US$1.44 billion) for the first time since 2003.", "description": "Rio\u2019s iron ore people have needed to cut a few quality corners to make sure it runs to guidance.
