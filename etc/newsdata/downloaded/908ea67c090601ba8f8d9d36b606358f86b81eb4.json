Out of nowhere, a mysterious figure starts hunting him, who turns out to be a young clone of himself (also Smith, with some motion capture trickery). Harry now must seek out his former boss (Clive Owen), the man behind all this, and avoid his younger self\u2019s bullets without killing both of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill and Jada are 23 years strong in their marriage, and also share daughter Willow, 18, however they recently revealed they were finally learning how to be in an \u2018adult\u2019 relationship with one another.\n\n23 years strong (Picture: Getty Images North America)\n\nJaden showed off his fresh pink hair (Picture: INSTAR Images)\n\nSpeaking to her mum Adrienne Banfield-Jones and Chelsea Handler on her Facebook show Red Table Talk, the 48-year-old actress said: \u2018I feel that I\u2019m just now entering an adult relationship with Will.\n\n\u2018After 23 years. We finally are learning to have an adult relationship.\u2019\n\nRed Table Talk has become known for celebrities opening up and The Smiths, well, being The Smiths.\n\nThe actress previously revealed why she and the rest of her family are always so honest about their lives and relationships when they go on her show.\n\nIn a chat with Stephen Colbert, she admitted they both wanted \u2018to kind of get rid of the idea that people in the public eye have perfect relationships\u2019.\n\n\u2018We were kind of sick of living up to that,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We were real sick of it. And then second of all, really having myself and Will come and talk about our relationship \u2013 sometimes you see just women do it alone or you just see a guy do it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemini Man is in UK cinemas 11 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
