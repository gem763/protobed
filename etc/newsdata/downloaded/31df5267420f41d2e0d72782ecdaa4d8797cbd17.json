It followed a US-brokered ceasefire struck last Thursday to allow Kurdish forces to retreat from an agreed safe zone\n\nTurkey launched a military offensive into northeast Syria on October 9 with the purported aim of creating a safe zone along the border to relocate the more than 3.6 million refugees it is hosting.\n\nThe offensive was launched within days of Trump pulling US troops from the area, held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and YPG, which are affiliated with Turkish Kurdish political groups Ankara considers to be terrorist organisations.\n\nThe incursion was widely condemned by Western countries, which had worked with Kurdish forces to dismantle the so-called Islamic State and led to sanctions against Turkey including an arms embargo from several EU member states.\n\nIn his address, Trump added that \"ISIS is under very, very strict, lock and key\" and that the \"small number\" of suspected IS fighters had been \"largely recaptured\".\n\n\"Now Turkey, Syria and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It's their neighbourhood,\" he said.\n\nHe also called on European countries to repatriate their foreign fighters.\n\nAhead of his speech, the American president had written on Twitter: \"Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border.\"\n\n\"Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE: Kurds will be removed from Turkish 'safe zone' in Syria", "description": "\"Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border,\" President Trump tweeted ahead of his address from the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/21/22/1000x563_cmsv2_eccbe2b1-95ee-5c86-ad87-7e8dd85d6834-4252122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
