But it also represents a small step toward what Lamborghini hopes will be the future of electric cars.\n\nOr, at least, electric supercars.\n\nI spent a few minutes talking with Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborghini's chief technical officer, as we stood next to the car. He's had strong feelings about hybrid and electric supercars. He's never been a fan of battery power in supercars. His stance is that batteries are just too big and heavy. Weight is the enemy of performance and, if you've ever sat inside a supercar, you know there's not a lot of room to spare.\n\nBut over the past couple of years, Reggiani has started talking about supercapacitors. That's what the Si\u00e1n has instead of a battery pack. It's located behind the seats, in front of the engine.\n\nSupercapacitors store power using an entirely different method from batteries. Think about it this way: when you rub your feet on a carpet then give someone an electric shock, or when you see lightning strike, those are examples of natural capacitors storing and releasing electricity. (The word \"si\u00e1n\" means \"lightning bolt\" in the traditional Bolognese dialect of Lamborghini's home in Italy.)\n\nRead More", "description": "Lamborghini's newest supercar, the $2 million Si\u00e1n hybrid, will be the fastest and most powerful Lamborghini ever made.
