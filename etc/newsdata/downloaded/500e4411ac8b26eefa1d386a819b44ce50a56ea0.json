It is most definitely not easy living with this dark secret that I feel so ashamed of.\"\n\nMr Thind, from Havant, Hampshire, said doctors in Ghent, Belgium, and Munich, Germany, confirmed he had nerve damage.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n(Image: Tom Wren SWNS)\n\nHe has undergone a minor operation which he hopes will fix his problem, although it is too early to know whether it has been successful.\n\nThe electrician told The Star : \"It\u2019s very difficult to come to terms with the fact things aren\u2019t working as they should.\n\n\"It\u2019s particularly difficult to deal with as someone who\u2019s only 26 years old and otherwise fit.\n\n\"(But) there\u2019s no point in me being depressed about what\u2019s happened.\"", "description": "Nat Thind, from Havant, Hampshire, said his inability to get an erection has become his 'dark secret'", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Tom Wren Swns", "Nat Thind Swns", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534118.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_ERECTION_PROBLEM_31.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
