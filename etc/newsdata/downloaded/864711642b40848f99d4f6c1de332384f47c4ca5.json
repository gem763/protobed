REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\n\nFast forward to the present, and Jiang finds himself wrestling with new challenges as stingy consumers and price wars have done little to boost earnings in an economy growing at its slowest pace in a decade.\n\nMoreover, even a welcome revival in the property market has only served to highlight a conundrum for policymakers as the \u2018wealth effect\u2019 of rising home prices has hardly been felt across the rest of the economy.\n\nThat has not only meant sales at businesses such as Jiang\u2019s continue to run on a low boil, but it also raises the risk that already-high household debt could worsen without a broader recovery the central bank is trying to engineer with lower rates.\n\n\u201cThe liquor business is kind of my silver lining,\u201d Jiang said of the high-margin category from his corner shop in Pyrmont, an inner-city Sydney suburb.\n\n\u201cWithout that I\u2019d have closed down years ago,\u201d he added, underscoring the persistent weakness in Australia\u2019s economy even as it is set to enter a 29th straight year of recession-free growth. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to spend. They are tightening their wallets to save for a house because interest rates are so low now.\u201d\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which delivered back-to-back rate cuts in June and July, has its work cut out given the official cash rate is already at an all-time low of 1%.\n\nThat leaves it with limited room to stimulate growth though it is still in an enviable position compared to the likes of Japan and the euro zone where policymakers have been forced to adopt negative rates to juice their economies.\n\n(Home prices, loan approvals jump after RBA rate cuts... here)\n\nMORE STIMULUS\n\nThe RBA easings have boosted the housing market with mortgage approvals up 5% in July, the strongest in four years while auction activity in the biggest markets of Sydney and Melbourne has been solid after two years of tepid sales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say whether the boom times in housing will return but the potential is there,\u201d said Miriam Sandkuhler, Melbourne-based CEO of Property Maven. \u201cIf we start getting high auction clearance rate against high volumes it\u2019s a sign the market is moving swiftly again.\u201d\n\nAnalysts and investors <0#YIB:> widely expect two more rate cuts by the RBA to 0.5% by early 2020 though there is growing doubt over how effective further easings would be when rates are already so low.\n\nEconomists overwhelmingly agree Australia\u2019s ruling center-right coalition must embark on an expansionary fiscal program but Prime Minister Scott Morrison is wedded to the idea of delivering a surplus this year.\n\nA return to surplus will be lost on many as activity outside of real estate is hardly encouraging - gross domestic product (GDP) growth has slowed to decade lows, retail spending is contracting, car sales collapsing and consumer and business confidence is falling.\n\nPolicymakers will also be concerned about the increasing number of Australian companies filing for bankruptcy. Government data showed the number of companies entering external administration jumped by a staggering 15% in the quarter-ended June from March. Just in July, that number surged to the highest since November 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning to see minimal impact from the government\u2019s tax cuts and interest rate cuts,\u201d said Sydney-based Diana Mousina, senior economist at AMP. (AMP.AX) \u201cWe think that more policy stimulus is necessary to lift Australian growth and inflation,\u201d he said.\n\n(Australia's sliding consumer, business sentiment: here)\n\nASSET BUBBLE?\n\nGrowth in the A$1.9 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy slowed sharply in the second-half of 2018, largely because Australia\u2019s indebted households cut spending on everything from clothing and footwear to eating out.\n\nThat leaves policymakers walking a tight rope as any over-exuberance in the housing market could further push up the household debt to income ratio in Australia, which at 190% is already among the highest in the world.\n\nFILE PHOTO: New houses are seen in surburban Melbourne May 12, 2010.

The deterioration was most pronounced for loans more than 90 days due.\n\nWith the corporate sector struggling and wages growth persistently weak, credit quality could come under further stress, S&P said.\n\nReflecting these concerns at a meeting of global policymakers late last month, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said: \u201cmonetary policy cannot deliver medium-term growth. We risk just pushing up asset prices.\u201d", "description": "When Michael Jiang scored a liquor license four years back, he had hoped it would help drive more sales at his struggling small grocery business in Sydney.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430301220&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F02F", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
