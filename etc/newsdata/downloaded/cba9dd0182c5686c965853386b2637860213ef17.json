They are looking for a balance of influencers who engage with their fans, create authentic content, and partner with brands authentic to them, rather than anyone who will just pay them.\"\n\nBrands will usually come back after a campaign is over and ask for certain performance metrics from the influencer. These metrics vary based on platform, like YouTube or Instagram, and will often determine whether or not that brand will continue a relationship with an influencer.\n\nBri and I had a blast at EA Play over the weekend! It was so great getting to meet everyone and I am SO EXCITED for the new Star Wars! #SponsoredByEA #EAPlay A post shared by Preston (@realtbnrfrags) on Jun 12, 2019 at 9:32pm PDT Jun 12, 2019 at 9:32pm PDT\n\nPerformance metrics on Instagram, from saves to comments\n\nOn Instagram, brands often want to see that an influencer's followers are engaging with the post. They can measure this by asking for metrics like saves, comments, and likes.\n\nKaty Bellotte, a YouTube creator (470,000 subscribers) and Instagram influencer (166,000 followers), earns money through a variety of ways online, with brand sponsorships at the top, she told Business Insider. In Bellotte's experience, brands pay more for a package than a single post, she said. A package typically includes one post on Instagram, a story, and sometimes a 30- to 60-second mention in a YouTube video.\n\nBellotte said that after she posts sponsored content to Instagram, a company typically comes back and asks for specific performance metrics, and recently, she has noticed companies asking for how many views a story got and how many people saved the post to their personal account.\n\nRead more: An Instagram influencer with 166,000 followers breaks down how much money she earns from a sponsored post\n\n\"You'll notice there are some creators out there who are getting smart about this,\" Bellotte said. \"Saying, 'To enter my giveaway, you have to save the post and then do X, Y, Z.' Then, when brands ask for the save numbers, they have an inflated number because they'll do things like that.\"\n\nAsano said brands were now looking at comments as a part of engagement, and if a majority of the comments are in a different language, then it's possible the influencer bought comments. He said brands also track if followers are mentioning the company within the comments, or have any intent on purchasing the product mentioned.\n\nPerformance on YouTube, from links to viewer demographics\n\nAnother way influencers earn money is by promoting products within a YouTube video. In a YouTube sponsorship, a brand can request a timed mention (typically 60 seconds) or a dedicated video.\n\nDan Levitt, the CEO of the digital-talent management firm Long Haul Management, told Business Insider that he has noticed more brands tracking how many viewers are clicking on a brand's website after a YouTube video sponsorship.\n\n\"Let's say a creator is doing a video about new product X. In the past, the brand might only care about views, especially in the demographic they care about,\" Levitt said. \"Now, in addition, they might include a trackable Bitly link to the brand website to buy the product and would track how many visitors to the website the link brought, and how many of those visitors actually made a purchase.\"\n\nMathew Micheli, a cofounder and managing partner at the influencer marketing agency Viral Nation, said brands still have a hard time understanding the value they are receiving from an influencer campaign. He said Viral Nation provides tools to measure in-depth video and post information, like which platform a viewer is watching from, where they are, and which point in a video they are dropping off at.\n\nOther industry insiders told Business Insider there has been an increase in brands asking about the geographic information of an influencer's audience. Typically, a YouTube manager or agent will send the brand their client's demographic percentage from their YouTube analytics page. US brands are looking for a majority of viewers to be from the US.\n\nReed Duchscher, the CEO of the digital-talent-management firm Night Media, told Business Insider that brands ask his clients for channel demographics.\n\n\"Most want to see the percentage based in the US,\" he said. \"A few have also asked for the mobile watch time, like on apps. We get a lot of inquiries about case studies and past brand collabs as well.\"\n\nFor more on the business of influencers, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "But even with these new measurements, some influencers are getting smart, and have figured out tricks for inflating these numbers.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf6b144af90904735320c6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
