We will not be doing this if we are instructed to do this by a governor who feels he wants to be politically correct. A prisoners could be in possession of a weapon or drugs which could be hidden if we have to knock first.'\n\nThis follows a report that shows that child criminals are being 'set up to fail' on release from custody because there is inadequate support in place to help them turn their life around, according to inspectors.\n\nThe probation and prison watchdogs reviewed the support boys aged 12 to 17 received from services in their first three months after release.\n\nThey followed 50 who had all committed serious crimes or were repeat offenders and had been sentenced to detention and training orders, which meant they served half their time in custody and half in the community.\n\nThey all served time in the five young offender institutions (YOI) across England and Wales \u2013 Parc in Wales, Cookham Wood in Kent, Feltham in London, Werrington in Staffordshire and Wetherby in West Yorkshire.\n\nIn the three months after release, half of the group had been investigated by police, 10 had been convicted of more crimes and six of the group had gone missing.\n\nThose who had reformed were 'the exception rather than the rule', inspectors said.\n\nRichard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, called for the number of children sent to prison to be reduced, adding: 'On just about every measure \u2013 housing, education and training, physical and mental health, drug and alcohol services, social services \u2013 the state is failing children and young people leaving prison.\n\n'Unsurprisingly, many of them get into further trouble with the law and go back to prison.'\n\nChief inspector of probation Justin Russell, who took on the role in June, said the results of the review painted a 'grim picture', adding: 'This is certainly the most disturbing report I've read since starting in my new role.'", "description": "The Youth Custody Service has completed a review into the detention of young people and claims they want institutions to respect the privacy of inmates and operate with a 'child focus'.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/11/19418036-0-image-a-4_1570877025074.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
