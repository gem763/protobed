The demonstrations have become increasingly violent, as protesters have clashed with police, who are using tear gas and rubber bullets to dispel them.\n\nDespite Wednesday\u2019s brutal attack, Sham and his colleagues say they won\u2019t be intimidated, and are pushing ahead with plans for another mass protest march on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe lost lives in the course of protests, we have more than two thousand protestors being arrested, many are injured by police brutality or state-sponsored thugs, and even lawmakers and activists were attacked,\u201d Eric Lai, a colleague of Sham\u2019s at the CHRF, told VICE News. \u201cBut people in Hong Kong are not afraid of expressing their demands and beliefs in the face of political violence.\u201d\n\nREAD: Beijing thinks Washington has 'sinister intentions to destroy' Hong Kong\n\nSham said he was walking to a CHRF meeting at around 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday when he was surrounded by four people wielding hammers. They attacked him, targeting his head and limbs. A group of people at a nearby garage attempted to intervene, but the attackers threatened them at knifepoint.\n\nSham said the attackers then fled in a seven-seater car.\n\nSham was brought to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries, which included three wounds on his head, each about 1-2in long. He did not suffer any fractured or broken bones, though his knee and elbow joints were swollen.\n\nREAD: Hong Kong protester says she was sexually assaulted by police after being arrested\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack. The police told a press conference late Wednesday night they are investigating the incident and said the attack was conducted by four masked men of \u201cof non-Chinese descent\u201d who were dressed in black.\n\nThe CHRF said there\u2019s a clear connection between the assault on Sham and the ongoing political turmoil in the city.\n\n\u201cThe Civil Human Rights Front strongly condemns the acts of the perpetrators. It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,\u201d the Front said in a statement.\n\nOthers have connected the attack to up-coming local elections in November. The assault on Sham, who is a candidate for the Sha Tin District Council\u2019s Lek Yuen constituency, came a week after two candidates running for the upcoming District Council election were assaulted while canvassing in their districts.\n\n\u201cThe recent blatant attacks on Jimmy Sham and other District Council candidates are attempts to spread white terror across the city,\u201d Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong activist who helped lead the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, told VICE News. \u201cAll of them intentionally targeted pro-democracy figures, showing that assailants and the authority behind them worry about the high turnout in the upcoming election which benefits pro-democracy candidates.\u201d\n\nBut Wong believes the attacks won\u2019t succeed in silencing opposition voices:\n\n\u201cThe assaults only add fuel to the fire, even though they are used to create a chilling effect on protesters with force and fear. More people realize democracy is the only way out. Injustice will only make Hongkongers more determined, resolute and tenacious in our cause for democracy.\u201d\n\nProtesters are adamant that a mass march will go ahead as planned on Sunday. The CHRF is calling on the police to publicly grant permission for the march to go ahead..\n\nOn Wednesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s embattled chief executive, was shouted down in parliament while delivering her state of the union speech, finally having to deliver it by video.\n\nREAD: China called the app Hong Kongers use to avoid tear gas 'poisonous.' So Apple removed it.\n\nHer speech attempted to begin to address some of the issues at the heart of the conflict, but protesters dismissed it, saying it didn\u2019t address their five core demands, which include a fully independent investigation into police behavior, amnesty for those arrested, universal suffrage and a halt to the characterization of protests as \u201criots.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Legislative Council chamber once again descended into chaos when 12 pro-democracy lawmakers were forcibly removed after repeatedly chanting slogans such as \u201cfive demands, not one less.\u201d and holding up placards showing Lam with blood on her hands.\n\nCover: A protester holds a sign outside Legislative Council as Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam delivers her speech in Hong Kong Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019. In chaotic scenes, furious pro-democracy lawmakers twice forced Hong Kong's leader to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy objectives and then clamored for her to resign after she walked out of the legislature on Wednesday.
