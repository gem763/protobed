I just put my full trust in them. It was just hurry, just sign this and send it back today,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJ Daniels argues that it never promised to help her refinance but merely act as an advocate for her with her dealings with NAB. Lawyers acting for J Daniels submitted taped recordings of phone calls between Ms Wade and its employees as evidence and argued she had a gambling problem.\n\nUnder cross-examination by lawyer Shaun Clement it emerged Ms Wade was regularly making unexplained cash withdrawals inside and nearby poker machine venues when she was behind in her mortgage payments. Ms Wade accepted she gambled but never more than $50 at a time.\n\n\u201cOver the space of four days you\u2019ve withdrawn $1300 in cash. That\u2019s more than your monthly home loan. You could have afforded your home loan payments,\u201d Mr Clement said.\n\nMs Wade accepted she played the poker machines but did not believe she had a problem. Brendan Esposito\n\nMs Wade said she didn\u2019t know what she spent the money on but was sure she didn\u2019t gamble the lot.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s your evidence that over this period you had cash funds to pay for your home loan but chose to spend it on something else?\u201d Mr Clement put to her.\n\n'High-risk case for modest reward'\n\nA damaging exchange took place soon after where Ms Wade admitted to acting as a shareholder, director and secretary for a company named Asset Protective Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder protection of a certificate that gave her privilege from self-incrimination, Ms Wade admitted to acting as a dummy director for four companies, of which three had been placed into administration.\n\nMs Wade said she signed a number of documents supplied to her by an accountant named Anthony, including one that was undated.\n\n\u201cI was asked if I wanted to take the money and I said yes, I was going bankrupt, I couldn\u2019t pay my rent and I was going to be evicted,\u201d she said.\n\nShe admitted the ATO had filed a writ against her and was seeking $1.3 million in unpaid liabilities and penalties, which she will most likely escape because of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMs Wade alleges she was buried in paperwork by the company when she gave them authority to act on her behalf. Supplied\n\nJ Daniels director Robert Mancy was in court for the proceedings but did not appear. Mr Mancy \u2013 who has previously worked as a debt collector at Telstra \u2013 declined to comment to questions about his relationships with other companies mentioned in the case.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearings, Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan stood closings over for two weeks and recommended both parties do their best to arrive at a settlement, suggesting they had more to lose than gain.\n\n\u201cThis case remains, in my view \u2013 and I say that for both parties \u2013 a high-risk case for modest reward,\u201d Justice O'Bryan said.\n\nTwo months after Justice Nye Perram\u2019s now famous responsible lending judgment, the drama playing out in Melbourne\u2019s Federal Court is more kitchen sink than high stakes.", "description": "A case involving a vulnerable home owner and a debt advocacy firm took an unusual turn after a surprise confession.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1914%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/204a5397445f05dbecee8554f35c975e7c5059b5", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
