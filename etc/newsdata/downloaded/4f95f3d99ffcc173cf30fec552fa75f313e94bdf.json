Walt, a Harvard scholar. He argues that the hard-to-swallow reality behind the withdrawal is that Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s brutal regime has won the civil war.\n\n\u201cThe dirty secret is that allowing Bashar Assad to regain all control over Syria is going to solve a number of vexing problems,\u201d Mr. Walt said. \u201cSaying that is a horrible thing because Assad is a war criminal and should be on trial for atrocities.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s execution \u2026 was extraordinarily clumsy,\u201d said Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute. \u201cHowever, his objective \u2014 reducing the risk exposure of those troops and taking the initial step toward ending Washington\u2019s Syria military mission \u2014 is not only appropriate, but overdue.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s critics offer nothing more than a compendium of policy cliches that would keep America mired in a murky, multisided conflict for decades,\u201d Mr. Carpenter told The Washington Times. \u201cWe already have a forever war in Afghanistan. The American people don\u2019t need another one in Syria.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Wash Times", "Washingtontimes.Com News Oct Donald-Trump-Syria-Withdrawal-Not-Only-Appropriate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
