'There are so many and they sometimes nudge the boat.\n\nSeveral other fishermen said more attacks on tourists are expected over the coming summer months as thousands of backpackers flock to the Great Barrier Reef from Europe and America.\n\nGrunter McCormack, 45, the skipper of a boat that fishes for coral trout, said he was not surprised by the recent attacks.\n\nHe told Daily Mail Australia: 'I see them all the time, especially bull sharks. They come for the bait and then they get caught and we have to deal with them. They are everywhere up here.\n\n'My brother got bitten on the arm by a bull shark out to sea. He just taped it up and he was fine but he had a nasty scar.'\n\nFisherman Chris Woodward said he has also seen plenty of sharks in the area recently.\n\n'There are a lot of them and they can be very aggressive', he said.\n\n'The bull sharks are very aggressive,' the fisherman said. 'There are so many and they sometimes nudge the boat\n\nGrunter McCormack (pictured), 45, the skipper of a boat that fishes for coral trout, said he was not surprised by the recent attacks\n\nLast month, more than 150 drum lines \u2013 baited hooks that stop sharks attacking tourists - were hauled out of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park after the federal court ruled killing the beasts was inhumane.\n\nThey were removed after conservation group Humane Society successfully challenged the shark control program in the federally-controlled area.\n\nBut the latest attack has revived debate about how to protect people from sharks in their habitat.\n\nFisherman say they need to be considered in the Whitsundays to save tourists from any more savage maulings.\n\nCommercial trout fisherman Kyle Black, 16, said drum lines should be put in as soon as possible.\n\n'That's why it's happening, they need to put drum lines in. I see sharks all the time,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'There will be more attacks this year if something isn't done.'\n\nFisherman Chris Woodward said he has also seen lots of sharks in the area recently. 'There are a lot of them and they can be very aggressive', he said.\n\nCommercial trout fisherman Kyle Black (pictured), 16, said drum lines should be put in as soon as possible\n\nAnother fisherman, Travis Collins, also said he was not surprised by the attacks.\n\n'I've seen so many sharks, I saw a couple of hammerheads not far from the beach the other day,' he said.\n\nAnd it's not just commercial fisherman who are wary of the danger that sharks pose.\n\nFormer gas fitter Greg Phillips, 58, has been fishing for fun in the area all of his life.\n\nHe told Daily Mail Australia that drum lines should be installed to protect tourists from attacks.\n\n'They've got to install drum lines to take out the rogue sharks and stop the attacks,' he said.\n\n'The drum lines would target the aggressive sharks that come close to shore. You wouldn't have to kill many of them to stop the attacks.\n\n'If they don't take action I would say we're going to see a lot more attacks happening this year.\n\n'I do believe in conservation - and they should only target a certain number of sharks - but protecting humans is also important.'\n\nFormer gas fitter Greg Phillips (pictured), 58, has been fishing for fun in the area all of his life\n\nWhitsunday MP Jason Costigan believes governments at all levels are failing to protect locals and tourists.\n\n'We are going to have more and more of this happening until governments put public safety as their number one priority,' he said.\n\nBULL SHARKS ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF Bull sharks are considered opportunistic feeders. They are believed to migrate to the Great Barrier Reef in warmer months. Many consider the bull shark to be the most dangerous in the world, due to its aggressive temperament.\n\nOn Tuesday Queensland Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Mark Furner said it was 'near impossible' to control sharks in the Whitsundays.\n\nHe said that the area where tourists swim and snorkel is too big to police effectively.\n\nBut Deputy Opposition Leader Tim Mander slammed the government for pulling up the drum lines.\n\n'The Palaszczuk Labor government has taken drum lines out of north Queensland with no plan B, leaving swimmers unprotected,' he said.\n\nMr Maggs suffered severe lacerations to his right calf during the attack, which happened while he was playing and 'thrashing' in the ocean with friend Alistair Raddon\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon Mr Maggs, from Plymouth, and his friend Mr Raddon, from Southampton, were recovering well in Mackay Base Hospital.\n\nKeith Maggs, Danny's father, said his son spent four hours on the operating table to make initial repairs, before going back under the knife a second time.\n\nMr Maggs said his son, a plumber, called him between the operations and described his ordeal as 'terrifying' and said he was glad his injuries were not worse.\n\nDanny's grandfather, Terry, said: 'He could have been killed. We're all feeling relieved that it wasn't any worse.\n\n'Danny qualified as a plumber in Plymouth and then he went travelling. He has been away from home for more than a year now and working along the way.'\n\nThe attack happened at 10.17am while the pair were swimming in the ocean off Hook Island, part of Queensland's Whitsunday Islands, which is a popular spot for tourists.\n\nBoth men were taking part in a snorkelling boat tour, with medics saying they were playing and thrashing in the water at the time.\n\nGrant Bollington, who was part of the helicopter crew which flew the pair to hospital, told the Queensland Times: '[Alistair] said they were wrestling in the water.\n\n'He thought his mate grabbed him really hard by the leg and turned around and saw blood in the water.'\n\nMr Raddon (pictured) had his right foot bitten off during the attack, which happened when he was play-fighting in the water with Mr Maggs\n\nMr Raddon had his right foot 'amputated' when he was attacked by a shark while snorkelling near the Great Barrier Reef in eastern Australia\n\nSanjeev Grewall, who was also part of the helicopter team, told how the men made it back to their tour boat where their lives were likely saved by quick-thinking tourists who also happened to be a medics.\n\nHe said the men - believed to be either German or Belgian nationals - applied tourniquets to both victims which stopped the bleeding.\n\nThe pair were then rushed back to Abel Point Marina at Airlie Beach, where their tour had departed from, where they were met by ambulance crews.\n\nFrom there, they were driven to the town of Proserpine, around 10 miles away, where they were met by a medical helicopter and airlifted to Mackay Base Hospital.\n\nThe Whitsundays region has been the site of five other shark attacks since last September.\n\nVictorian Daniel Christidis, 33, was fatally attacked last November at Cid Harbour during a trip with friends and colleagues.\n\nThat incident followed separate attacks within 24 hours in September at Cid Harbour on Tasmanian Justine Barwick and 12-year-old Victorian Hannah Papps.\n\nIn October 2018, a fisherman was bitten on his shoulder as he hauled a reef shark into his boat.\n\nEarlier this year a man was bitten on the thigh at Hardy Reef, about 50km northeast of Hamilton Island.", "description": "Local fishermen have told Daily Mail Australia they are not surprised by the recent shark attack in the Whitsundays which left one tourist without a foot and another with serious injuries.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore In Mackay For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20367714-0-image-a-2_1572429205271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
