Maybe he does that instinctively, because he doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with what he\u2019s admitting to. Possibly he does it strategically, because he realizes that people are less likely to view something as scandalous if the accused is willing to admit to it straight out.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been his approach to the Ukraine case in every particular. For instance, he\u2019s never admitted to the most damning allegation, that he deliberately withheld Ukraine\u2019s military aid to put pressure on them to launch an investigation of the Bidens. He knows that evidence of him trying to extort Zelensky directly would move this into dangerous waters. But as to the simpler allegation, that he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to \u201crequest\u201d that a foreign government investigate a potential general election opponent \u2014 sure, he\u2019ll cop to that, even though some Democrats (and not just Democrats) insist that that alone would be big trouble. Trump\u2019s approach is to confess and shrug. What about it? What\u2019s the problem?\n\nHere he is this morning going all-in on saying the proverbial quiet part loud. Not just with Ukraine this time, either. China too.\n\nPresident Trump: \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\" pic.twitter.com/Xia8vLUVT2 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 3, 2019\n\nI didn\u2019t see the question before this but a CNN reporter claims that the \u201crequest\u201d to China also came in the context of a threat:\n\nTrump at 10:37:24 a.m., talking about trade negotiations: \"I have a lot of options on China, but if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous power.\" Trump at 10:37:54 a.m., asked about Ukraine probe: \"Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\" \u2014 Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) October 3, 2019\n\nJoe Biden is out with a statement noting that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has publicly solicited a foreign adversary to make trouble for a Democratic candidate. When he did it in 2016, he was still a private citizen and his \u201crequest\u201d was played off as a joke\u2026\n\n\u2026but this morning\u2019s request obviously isn\u2019t a joke and he isn\u2019t a private citizen anymore. He\u2019s a man with the power to end the trade war that\u2019s wrecking China\u2019s economy if Beijing \u201ccooperates\u201d with him.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to say that his new \u201crequest\u201d to Ukraine doesn\u2019t matter because the quasi-transcript of his July call with Zelensky already quotes him asking about the Bidens. All he did this morning was repeat his interest. There\u2019s nothing new there. But it\u2019d be more accurate to say there\u2019s nothing new about it *to you and me*, because we follow this story closely. A poll out earlier this week of the general public, though, found that just 40 percent of Republicans believe that Trump brought up Biden during his chat with Zelensky even though the White House\u2019s own document confirms that he did. By doubling down on it in front of the cameras this morning, Trump handed Democrats video proof that can be laid in front of skeptical voters of his willingness to solicit foreign aid in going after a political enemy.\n\nThe defense to this will be that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the president investigating possible corruption by a former high-ranking U.S. official, even if that means input from foreign governments. That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s passing strange that Trump\u2019s interest in Biden\u2019s corruption bloomed so late, right around the time Biden was inching towards entering the 2020 presidential race. POTUS and the GOP enjoyed total control of government for two years; where was the House Republican investigation of Biden and Ukraine then? For that matter, if the president\u2019s worried about corruption in the abstract instead of benefiting himself electorally by damaging Biden, it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s not \u201crequesting\u201d that China investigate Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao. They were also a subject of Peter Schweizer\u2019s book \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d one of the prime sources for the current allegations about the Bidens. And unlike Biden, McConnell and Chao are both current government officials with tremendous power. What\u2019s the \u201cneutral\u201d explanation for investigating Biden but not the McConnells if all Trump is doing here is draining the swamp very belatedly?\n\nI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s still talking about the Bidens and Ukraine or China at all. He has a million cronies on the Hill and in righty media who\u2019d be happy to hammer this message for him day and night so that he can keep his fingerprints off of it. Biden\u2019s probably done anyway, as his lead over Elizabeth Warren has all but disappeared in the RCP poll average. If Bernie Sanders is forced to leave the race for health reasons, most of his support will likely migrate to her and she may become a prohibitive frontrunner before long. All Trump is doing by providing soundbites like this at this point is handing Democrats material to use against him and meanwhile he reaps no corresponding benefit from it in damaging the likely nominee, Warren. Probably he thinks he has to lead the PR effort because he\u2019s convinced no one around him can deliver his message as effectively as he can. If that means staring squarely into a camera and saying sure, I\u2019d love for foreign governments to investigate Joe Biden, then hey.", "description": "Great.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-5.jpg"}
