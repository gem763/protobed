This then-nascent technical achievement gave rise to a still-ongoing debate over the survivability of the U.S.\u2019s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, as the DF-21D outranged the strike planes serving on carrier decks. This further compelled the U.S. Navy to introduce anti-ballistic missile capability to its destroyers and cruisers in the form of the SM-3 missile.\n\nBallistic missiles travel in an arcing trajectory to maximize range and velocity, sometimes even exiting the Earth\u2019s atmosphere before plunging down towards their targets at unthinkably fast speeds\u2014in the DF-21\u2019s case, up to ten times the speed of sound. However, until a decade ago there were no operational anti-ship ballistic missiles (though one was developed by the Soviet Union, but did not enter service) because it\u2019s a lot easier to program a ballistic missile to hit a city or military base, than to have one strike a small, moving target\u2014ie, a ship.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Tehran has lots of missiles.
