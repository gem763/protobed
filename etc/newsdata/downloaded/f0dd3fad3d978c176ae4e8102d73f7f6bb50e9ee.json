The activists also sprayed the slogan \u201cStop funding climate death\u201d on the walls of the building.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury has been frustrating efforts by other government departments to take action against climate change because it cares only about economic growth,\u201d one of the activists, named Ben, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t see that eternal economic growth leads to climate death,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThe red symbolises the people dying now in the global south and also the people who are going to start dying from climate change all around the world if we do nothing.\u201d\n\nPolice said they arrested four people on suspicion of criminal damage and that some roads had been closed. At the scene, police puzzled over what to do with the fire engine as the driver removed the keys.\n\nThe fire engine was purchased on eBay, the activists told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nExtinction Rebellion wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.\n\nThe group disrupted London with 11 days of protests in April that it cast as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history. Iconic locations were blocked, the Shell building defaced, trains stopped and Goldman Sachs targeted.\n\nThe British Treasury, which traces its history back to William the Conqueror, is located in a grand building between Buckingham Palace and the British parliament.", "description": "Climate change activists used a fire engine to spray red paint at the facade of the British finance ministry on Thursday in an attempt to draw attention to what they said was the government's failure to avert a looming climate cataclysm.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436604937&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920O6"}
