That wood can end up anywhere across Europe, from furniture to paper or building materials.\n\nLiviu Pop had gone out to investigate a possible case of illegal logging in a mountainous region of Maramures in north Romania when his colleagues became concerned.\n\nImage copyright Facebook/Liviu Pop Image caption Liviu Pop had three children and is thought to be the sixth ranger to die in recent years\n\nThey tried to reach him by phone but received no response, according to local media reports.\n\nThe body of the married father of three was found by police in a forest gorge on Wednesday night. An investigation has been opened but there are no suspects at this stage, case prosecutor, Bogdan Gabor, told the BBC.\n\nHe may have been shot with his own gun, the prosecutor added.\n\nRaducu Gorcioaia, 50, was found dead in his car last month, a short distance away from an illegal logging site in Pascani forest district in the north-east of the country.\n\nThe forest ranger had suffered serious head injuries reportedly caused by an axe. Three people, including two teenagers, are suspects in the case.\n\n'Thugs tried to kill me'\n\nGabriel Paun knows all about the violence associated with illegal logging.\n\n\"The forest mafia has tried to kill me several times,\" the head of environmental group Agent Green told the BBC. He has spent decades trying to protect Romania's wilderness.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why one of Europe's last great beech forests is facing the chop.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that forest rangers and activists like us are being killed while investigating illegal logging in Romania.\"\n\n\"Four years ago I was investigating close to Retezat National Park and a bunch of thugs attacked me and tried to kill me. They broke my ribs, cracked my head open and broke my hand before I managed to escape by running,\" he said.\n\nAlthough there are suspects in his case case, the prosecution has been slow and no-one has yet been convicted. However, this month the suspects will finally face a court.\n\n\"All this time they were free and I feared for my life,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Levente Peter Image caption Romania's forests are home to bears, wolves and lynx but are being chopped down at an alarming rate\n\nRomania's state-owned forest management company, Romsilva, which manages 48% of the country's forests, strongly condemned the latest killing and cited alarming numbers of attacks against forestry workers who were trying to protect against \"wood thieves\".\n\nIt has counted 16 attacks on its forestry workers this year alone.\n\nThe head of the Silva Trade Union Federation, Silviu Geana, complains that rangers are unable to defend themselves and six rangers have now lost their lives in recent years.\n\n'Chipboard for furniture'\n\nRomania's forests are being chopped down at an alarming rate and the murder of forestry workers trying to protect the wilderness may do little to slow it down.\n\nImage copyright Inquam Photos/George Calin Image caption Forestry unionists protested outside parliament in Bucharest last month over lack of resources and safety\n\nResearch by Greenpeace Romania estimates that Romania is losing as much as three hectares of its total forest cover every hour as a result of degradation, illegal and legal logging \u2014 including swathes of its pristine old-growth forests.\n\nLast month three NGOs, Agent Green, ClientEarth and EuroNatur, filed a complaint to the European Commission against Romania's government, alleging that its logging practices often contravened EU law on nature protection.\n\n\"There is a lot at stake because Romania is home to the last, vast old-growth and primeval forest cover \u2014 but they are simply becoming chipboard for furniture.\" Gabriel Paun said.\n\nImage copyright Agent Green Image caption This is a legal sawmill but activists complain Romania's government is not regulating the industry properly\n\nThe government in Bucharest says it has boosted efforts to fight illegal logging, with better inspection and monitoring, but the EU says big challenges lie ahead.\n\nThe day after Liviu Pop was shot dead in a forest in Maramures, he was out investigating a logging site in the Eastern Carpathians by one of the biggest commercial logging companies operating in Romania.\n\n\"They have removed much more wood than was legal to cut, but the question here is why the government allows an old-growth forest that was formed after the last ice-age to be completely removed?'\"\n\nHe was later chased away by the loggers. He escaped without harm, but the risks for those fighting to defend Romania's forests is clear.", "description": "Liviu Pop died last week, the second forest ranger killed in the past month.", "authors": ["Stephen Mcgrath"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12D99/production/_109290277_f45d2490-7362-4ef7-9568-24abb8a7a54a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
