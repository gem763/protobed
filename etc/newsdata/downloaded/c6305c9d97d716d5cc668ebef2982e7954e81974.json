More rallies are expected this weekend.\n\nOn Friday, organizers said the Hong Kong Open women\u2019s tennis tournament scheduled Oct. 5-13 was being postponed indefinitely. The event was to be held at Victoria Park, a gathering point for many previous protests.\n\nEarlier this week, protesters in the stands at a World Cup soccer qualifier match between Hong Kong and Iran booed the Chinese national anthem and chanted slogans for their cause. Iran\u2019s request for a venue change had been rejected.\n\nLunchbox Theatrical Productions called off a monthlong run of the London West End musical \u201cMatilda\u201d at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Acts that was to open Sept. 20.\n\n\u201cSadly the 14 weeks of civil unrest in Hong Kong have decimated ticket sales, and more importantly we cannot guarantee the safety and wellbeing of our international company, which comprises a large number of young children,\u201d CEO James Cundall said in a statement. He said he hopes the show can be staged next year.\n\nThe protests began in June over an extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent China for trial. Many saw the bill as an example of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy eroding since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nThe government last week promised to withdraw the bill, but the protesters\u2019 demands have widened to include direct elections for their city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been arrested in the protests, which have further battered Hong Kong\u2019s economy reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. Tourist numbers have plunged, and businesses have been hit by the protests that show no signs of abating.\n\nProtest-related activities are expected to continue Friday, when Chinese celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival with lanterns and mooncakes. Police banned a planned major march in central Hong Kong on Sunday, but many protesters have said they will turn up anyway.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A tennis tournament and a London musical are the latest events postponed in Hong Kong out of concerns over safety and disruptions from more pro-democracy protests.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/hong_kong_protests_94717_c0-236-5000-3151_s1770x1032.jpg?215f57f6fbae0ac77c672a26c19891b8293c4cfc", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
