Samuel Patten, whose work took him to some of the world\u2019s most exotic and dangerous locations, found himself last winter in a Washington gym populated with carjackers and crack dealers.\n\nThe longtime Republican political consultant had pleaded guilty to charges spun out of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russian election interference investigation. Patten avoided prison, but he sought the advice of ex-convicts when he thought he was going to serve time.\n\n\u201cI was mentally and physically preparing to go to prison,\u201d he told The Washington Times. \u201cI was learning how to behave in prison. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be there for long, but I was ready for it.\u201d\n\nInstead, Patten was sentenced to serve three years of probation, pay a $5,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service for failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In pleading guilty, he admitted to but was not charged for securing tickets to President Trump\u2019s inauguration on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch. That act, made through an American \u201cstraw purchaser,\u201d violated laws barring foreign money from flowing to presidential inauguration committees.\n\nPatten remains among a handful of people convicted of violating foreign lobbying laws in the past 50 years. A jury last month found Obama White House counsel Greg Craig not guilty of similar charges. Last week, the Justice Department ended its foreign lobbying investigation into Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta and former Republican Rep. Vin Weber without bringing charges.\n\nAvoiding jail time gave Patten a jump-start on stitching up a reputation tarnished by the Mueller probe, which turned up plenty of wrongdoing. The special counsel filed 34 indictments, including against nearly two dozen Russians accused of election meddling. On Monday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the Internet Research Agency and its financier, who were among those indicted by Mr. Mueller.\n\nBut mere witnesses caught up in the investigation had their lives wrecked as business clients walked away and death threats piled up. For those tainted by a guilty plea, the road is even tougher.\n\nUnlike others, however, Patten sees his scarlet letter as an asset, not an albatross.\n\n\u201cIn this town, to survive an investigation like that is actually a plus,\u201d he said. \u201cFew people have looked the dragon in the face and survived.\u201d\n\nStill, the conviction stings, and there is a twinge of bitterness over becoming ensnared in an investigation into a president whom Patten says he didn\u2019t support.\n\n\u201cI held my nose and voted for the witch who later destroyed me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to vote for [Libertarian Party candidate] Gary Johnson, but my wife persuaded me to vote for [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton.\u201d\n\nPatten is trying to rebuild his life by creating a better one. He has quit drinking, attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and has dropped 40 pounds. He jokingly refers to his weight loss as the \u201cBob Mueller diet.\u201d\n\nBut challenges remain.\n\nA political junkie, Patten longs to return to the consulting work that has evaporated. He sees that avenue as unlikely.\n\nThe saga also has taken an economic toll on Patten and his wife, Laura. Legal fees have wiped out his retirement savings, and the stigma of a conviction hangs over him as he ponders his next opportunity.\n\nThe lack of work has left him to focus on completing his community service obligations. He is tutoring inner-city youths, cooking meals for the homeless and working to help formerly incarcerated people in the District find work. Some groups rebuffed his assistance because of the Mueller stain.\n\nSome of the wounds are starting to heal, Patten said, and it helps that the Mueller investigation did not find any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cTime does make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the rancor, bitterness and resentment does start to fade a little bit because the worm is turning. I think the national perspective and public opinion is changing and more people are seeing it for what it is.\u201d\n\nPatten said he hasn\u2019t decided on his next steps. He grew up in Maine and has floated the idea of running against Sen. Susan M. Collins, a moderate Republican from that state. He worked on her failed gubernatorial bid in 1994 and her successful Senate run in 1996.\n\nThe former newspaper reporter also is writing a book.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how he ended up this position.\n\nHe was raised in a blue-blooded Washington family. As a child, he attended dinner parties whose guests included Supreme Court justices, ambassadors and journalists. Those parties were hosted by his grandmother, Susan Mary Alsop, who was dubbed \u201cthe grand dame of Washington Society\u201d by the Los Angeles Times upon her death.\n\nObsessed with politics after the Collins campaigns, he moved on to George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2001, Patten moved to Moscow, where he worked for a pro-democracy nonprofit headed by Sen. John McCain. He met Konstantin Kilimnik before Mr. Kilimnik became an associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, another Mueller target. Patten and Mr. Kilimnik eventually formed a consulting business, which received more than $1 million for Ukrainian lobbying work, according to court documents.\n\nMr. Kilimnik was later indicted by Mr. Mueller, who said he had ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nPatten disputes that assertion.\n\n\u201cIt continues to be my belief that he\u2019s a hustler like I am,\u201d he said. \u201cMueller said he had a diplomatic passport. I never saw it or was aware he had one. If he had one, that is a question, but Russia is a mercenary country where you can get anything for a fee.\u201d\n\nPatten\u2019s consulting work led to Ukraine, where he worked alongside Manafort to advise a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. In 2014, Patten wrote op-eds on behalf of his Ukrainian clients and introduced them to members of the executive branch and Congress. Federal prosecutors said those activities violated foreign lobbying laws.\n\nThe activities included buying four inauguration tickets paid for by Ukrainian oligarch Vadim Novinsky, who has business interests in the U.S. Although Mr. Novinsky did not attend the bash, Patten said, he was at President Obama\u2019s inauguration. Patten attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration with another wealthy Ukrainian and noted that he wasn\u2019t the only foreigner there.\n\n\u201cNone of this struck me as high treason,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some devilish conspiracy. I was doing a favor for a client. Because I\u2019m an international political consultant, I didn\u2019t have this \u2018oh my God they\u2019re foreigners\u2019 mentality, but in retrospect maybe I should have. I just thought we were a more sophisticated country.\u201d\n\nThe identity of the American straw purchaser will remain secret, Patten said.\n\n\u201cThis dogs\u2013 narrative has hurt enough people, and this person was simply doing me a favor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a town full of snitches, but I won\u2019t be one.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Patten voluntarily testified before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He later admitted in court that he \u201cmisled\u201d the committee by withholding documents that would have disclosed foreign money was used to purchase the tickets.\n\nPatten\u2019s Senate testimony attracted the attention of the special counsel\u2019s team.\n\nUnlike others grilled by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, Patten doesn\u2019t have animosity toward them. He agreed to cooperate and provide assistance with other investigations.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at the basic decency of the people on the Justice Department side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not fun and sort of terrifying, but my general sense is they were diligently going through a bunch of stuff foisted upon them to try to figure out what happened.\u201d\n\nHowever, Patten\u2019s view of the Senate intelligence committee is vastly different. He called his hearing a \u201csetup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe viciousness and nastiness of the people on the Hill is stunning,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the people who pushed the [Russian] investigation based on wishful thinking, innuendo and lies to destroy people.\u201d\n\nPatten admits he withheld \u201ca handful\u201d of emails detailing how he bought the inauguration tickets from the more than 1,300 documents he turned over to the committee, but he paints the omission as a mistake rather than an attempt to conceal.\n\n\u201cI should have turned them over and I didn\u2019t, and I admitted my wrongdoing. But I made judgment calls and thought, stupidly, that I was giving them enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave them the full flavor without every little detail.\n\n\u201cAlso, they said they were investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, not Ukrainians attending the 2017 inauguration. I would submit there is a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nPatten said the Senate committee misled him. He said he and his attorney were assured he would not be asked about the Foreign Agents Registration Act \u2014 the federal law Patten later admitted to violating \u2014 but instead the investigators asked him about it multiple times.\n\n\u201cThis is unequivocally, categorically false. As court documents have noted, it is Mr. Patten who lied to the committee \u2014 never the other way around,\u201d said Rachel Cohen, a committee spokeswoman.\n\nPatten sees it differently. \u201cMy honest responses to those questions are what the government used to prosecute me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he hopes there will eventually be some accountability for the runaway investigations and has even filed a complaint with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, but he added, \u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
