Larry Hogan participates in the Yahoo! Finance All Markets Summit at Union West on Thursday in New York. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the latest Republican elected official to say he supports an impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\n\u201cI think we do need an inquiry because we have to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Hogan told Margaret Hoover of PBS\u2019s Firing Line, in an interview that was taped Thursday night and will be aired in full on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t see any other way to get to the facts.\u201d\n\nThe popular two-term governor said he is \u201cnot ready\u201d to say he supports an impeachment or a removal of the president, but thinks an inquiry of his conduct is warranted. House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry just over two weeks ago, focusing on Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nHogan joins fellow Republican Govs. Phil Scott (Vermont) and Charlie Baker (Mass.) in backing an investigation. But Hogan, who is term-limited and decided against a primary challenge to Trump earlier this year, also raised concerns about the process moving forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about can we have a fair and objective one, and I\u2019m not sure we can in this Democratic Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nHogan, an outspoken critic of Trump, reiterated that he did not vote for the Republican nominee in 2016. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t support the president the first time,\u201d he told Hoover in the interview. \u201cHe has certainly done nothing to make me, you know, more supportive.\u201d\n\nEarlier Thursday, Hogan was asked during an event hosted by Yahoo! Finance in New York City whether Congress should move forward with articles of impeachment. He answered that it was too early to say but he is \u201ctroubled\u201d by allegations.\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo Republican governors say they support impeachment inquiry of Trump\n\nHogan, in New Hampshire, says he\u2019s seriously considering a primary challenge to Trump\n\nHogan will not challenge Trump, leaving Trump\u2019s GOP critics with limited options\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "But the Republican governor say he is concerned about whether the process will be fair and objective.", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Oz3luq9cSxOgjvpifcnIIkbddXg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GM6YDHXMFYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
