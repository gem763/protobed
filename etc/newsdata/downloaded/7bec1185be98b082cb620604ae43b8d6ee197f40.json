She\u2019s criticized him in the past for proposing a rule that would allow federal contractors to make employment decisions based on religious convictions, and she\u2019s pushed back against tweets from the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump about the city\u2019s gun violence.\n\nTrump has frequently slammed Chicago for its gun problems, describing the shootings as \u201chorrible carnage,\u201d calling the city a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d and comparing it to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on new Americans,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe bad blood runs deep between Trump and politicians in the Windy City, which Democratic rival Hillary Clinton took by more than 70 percentage points in 2016.\n\nDays into his presidency, Trump warned that if Chicago did not stem the violence, he would \u201csend in the Feds.\u201d In 2016, the city recorded its bloodiest year in nearly two decades, with more than 760 homicides.\n\nThe Trump administration has followed up on the threat with action.\n\nOver the last two years, the Justice Department has added a dozen criminal prosecutors to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago. In 2017, the department also created the Chicago Gun Strike Force, a partnership with the Chicago Police Department that led to 20 agents being added to the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office.\n\nMost of the gun violence occurs in a handful of low-income, predominantly African American neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South and West sides.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago reports a 44% increase in the number of defendants it has charged with gun-related offenses in 2019 compared with last year, a 15-year high for new prosecutions.\n\n\u201cWe are using every available federal law enforcement tool to reduce violent crime and help keep our citizens safe,\u201d U.S. Attorney John Lausch said.\n\nThe number of homicides in the city has dropped 31% thus far in 2019, compared with the same point in 2016, and shooting incidents have decreased by 38% over that time period, according to Chicago Police Department data.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Trump\u2019s Justice Department deserves credit for helping the police department make strides in reducing gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a partnership as with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office as we\u2019ve had with John Lausch,\u201d Guglielmi said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone on ride-alongs with the superintendent on holiday weekends. He\u2019s at all the gun stat meetings.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to skip Trump\u2019s address angered the city\u2019s police officers\u2019 union, the Fraternal Order of Police, which said in a Facebook post that \u201csuch a gesture would be an insult to both President Trump and the office of the presidency itself and would be a mark of disgrace upon the city throughout the entire nation, including Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u201d\n\nThen FOP Lodge 7, which represents rank-and-file Chicago police officers, announced that it had cast a vote of no confidence in Johnson.\n\nThe vote might please Trump, who likes to tell officers not to treat crime suspects so gently and was cheered at last year\u2019s gathering of the same police chiefs\u2019 organization in Orlando, Florida, when he advocated the use of the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing tactic that has been deemed unconstitutional.\n\nThe president\u2019s visit also comes at a complicated moment for the city. More than 25,000 members of the Chicago Teachers Union have been on strike since Oct. 17.\n\nJohnson is also under an internal investigation opened after he was found earlier this month sleeping in a city-owned vehicle.\n\nLightfoot said the superintendent, who called for the investigation, told her he had \u201ca couple of drinks with dinner\u201d before he fell asleep at a stop sign while driving home. Johnson said the episode was related to a change in his blood-pressure medication.\n\nIn addition to his address to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Trump is also scheduled to hold a campaign fundraiser.\n\nThe last time Trump visited Chicago was as a presidential candidate in 2016 for what was supposed to be a campaign rally on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago. But after fights broke out between supporters and protesters awaiting his arrival at the arena, Trump canceled the event before taking the stage. He said that he consulted Chicago police before making the decision.\n\nThe city\u2019s top cop at the time, interim Superintendent John Escalante, said Trump\u2019s telling was not true.\n\nEscalante said he believes the organizers of the rally canceled it because they could see that about half of the people inside the arena were anti-Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they saw that, and they didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed,\u201d Escalante said. \u201cThey could see it wasn\u2019t going to look good and told him, \u2018You are going to get shouted down,\u2019 and they made up this thing about safety concerns.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBabwin reported from Chicago.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's visit to Chicago is stirring up a tempest even before he arrives in the city that he's repeatedly derided as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/081893_trump-chicago-45074-donald-trump-file-in-oct-21-2019-file-photo-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
