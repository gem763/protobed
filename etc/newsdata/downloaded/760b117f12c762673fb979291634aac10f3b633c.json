At Alibaba\u2019s 20th anniversary party in Hangzhou, Alibaba\u2019s headquarters, over 140,000 employees and clients gathered to watch Ma, wearing a studded leather jacket and wig, end his legendary career by singing an inspirational Chinese rock song, \u201cA Life in Full Bloom.\u201d\n\nJack Ma performs onstage during Alibaba's 20th anniversary party at a stadium in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer More\n\nHe also sang \u201cYou Raise Me Up\u201d with the incoming chairman Zhang. Zhang is known as the brains behind Singles Day, the biggest shopping holiday in the world that brought in $30.8 billion in sales last year.\n\nMa, who has a strong interest in music and movies, is known for performing at Alibaba\u2019s anniversary galas. Two years ago, the video of Ma dancing to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBillie Jean\u201d in the signature golden outfit went viral.\n\n\u201cAlibaba is just one of my many dreams,\u201d Ma said on stage before his performance. \u201cThe world is so good. I live a busy and active life and there are so many opportunities. I wouldn't retire when I am so young.\u201d\n\nIn his farewell speech, the 55-year-old entrepreneur spoke highly of the succession plan he helped put into place, and promoted opportunities to serve consumers in China as well as globalization.\n\nMa said he had been thinking about the succession plan for 10 years to ensure Alibaba can carry on the corporate culture he helped build. In 2010, Alibaba introduced a unique governance body called Lakeside Partners. The group currently consists of 36 people, including original founding members and senior management. The partners have the exclusive right to nominate a simple majority of Alibaba\u2019s board of directors, subject to shareholders\u2019 approval during the annual general meeting.\n\nMa\u2019s future\n\nDespite the well-planned farewell, Ma is likely to continue to have an influence on Alibaba going forward. Most partners will leave the group once they leave Alibaba, except Ma and vice executive chairman, Joe Tsai. The company\u2019s board structure enables partners to assert control over a majority of the board, despite their minority equity positions. Ma, who will also serve on the company\u2019s board of directors until next year, now holds 6.2% of Alibaba shares, according to latest filings.\n\nThe vision Ma and his partners established for Alibaba is to serve 2 billion customers by 2036 and keep the company alive for at least 102 years, so its lifespan can spread across three centuries. The company also recently published a new set of corporate values, including putting customers first, employees second and shareholders third.\n\nSeptember 10 is not only Ma\u2019s birthday (he turned 55), but it is also known as Teacher\u2019s Day in China. The former English teacher said he will focus on philanthropy and education going forward, areas that he has already been working in the past few years. On Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, Ma\u2019s account name is Village Teacher Ma Yun. He has over 24 million followers.\n\nKrystal Hu covers technology and China for Yahoo Finance.
