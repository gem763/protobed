Thunberg delivered an impassioned climate plea at the Climate Action Summit earlier in the day, but it was Knowles's reference to Thunberg's Asperger's that prompted the backlash.\n\nWhile discussing the partisan politics of climate change, Knowles said, \"The climate hysteria movement is not about science. If it were about science, it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.\"\n\nKnowles's \"mentally ill Swedish child\" reference to Thunberg was immediately refuted by fellow guest, progressive radio host Christopher Hahn. \"How dare you,\" called out Hahn, adding, \"You're a grown man and you're attacking a child. Shame on you.\"\n\nKnowles defended his statement by claiming that he was attacking Thunberg's parents, but Hahn didn't have it. \"Relax, skinny boy. I got this. OK? You're attacking a child. You're a grown man. Have some couth when you're on television,\" fired back Hahn.\n\nHahn continued blasting Knowles, \"Maybe on your podcast, you can get away and say whatever you want because nobody's listening. You're on national television, be a grown-up when you're talking about children. She's trying to save the planet because your president doesn't believe in climate change.\"\n\n\"You're despicable,\" said Hahn, demanding Knowles take back his comments about Thunberg, but Knowles just doubled down on his \"mentally ill\" statement, citing a book Thunberg's mother wrote.\n\nFollowing the interview, Fox News issued a statement, saying: \"The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful \u2014 we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\"\n\nIn statements to THR, autism advocate groups slammed The Daily Wire's Michael Knowles after he called teen activist Greta Thunberg a \"mentally ill Swedish child\" https://t.co/b23cW2irM5 \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) September 24, 2019\n\nBut, it doesn't seem like that statement from Fox fully circulated the news division, because on The Ingraham Angle later that night, host Laura Ingraham continued to shade the young climate activist. After playing multiple clips of the 16-year-old's climate address from Monday, Ingraham asked, \"Does anyone else find that chilling?\"\n\nIngrahm juxtaposed footage of Thunberg's speech with a clip from Stephen King's Children of the Corn, adding, \"I can't wait for Stephen King's sequel: Children of the Climate.\"\n\nThe Story With Martha MacCallum airs weekdays at 4 p.m. on Fox News.\n\nSee Sean Spicer goes political on 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
