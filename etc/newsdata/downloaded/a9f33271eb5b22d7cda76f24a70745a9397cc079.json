You can't compare them to Man City. They are a completely different team.\n\n\"They are relentless and they should win a title playing the football and amassing the points they have.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut whilst those comments will come as music to the ears of Liverpool fans, Neville left them upset by labelling Mohamed Salah \"theatrical\" for going down in the box.\n\nHe was branded \"biased\" by some Reds fans, who voiced their displeasure at the former United player on social media.", "description": "Gary Neville has compared Liverpool with the Premier League title-winning Manchester United sides he was involved in", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20006816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Aston-Villa-v-Everton-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
