Still, there are greater and lesser works within that filmography, and \"Country Music\" -- an eight-part, 16-hour epic about a lot more than done-me-wrong songs -- distinctly falls into the latter scale.\n\nOver the last 30 years, Burns' signature war trilogy -- \"The Civil War,\" \"The War\" (about World War II) and \"The Vietnam War\" -- provides the spine of his work for public television. Yet the collaboration also has devoted admirable time to \"The National Parks,\" \"Baseball\" and \"Prohibition,\" albeit with less operatic heft.\n\n\"Country Music\" is at its best, not surprisingly, in the early going. Burns goes back to the 1920s, charting the birth of the genre, the way different groups placed their stamp on it, and its impact during the Depression.\n\nMoving assiduously through history, the documentary connects individual artists to the development of the form, which evolves into subgenres like bluegrass and rockabilly. As writer Dayton Duncan observes in the press release, the music \"sprang from diverse roots, and it sprouted many branches.\"\n\nSome of those stories are fascinating, and as always, Burns' work is peppered with meticulously researched anecdotes. Those tend to be most engaging when charting rags-to-riches stories associated with country stars from Johnny Cash to Elvis Presley -- like Willie Nelson, after receiving his first royalty check, planting a kiss on the singer who made his song a hit.\n\nRead More", "description": "'Country Music' review: PBS documentary registers on lower scale of Ken Burns histories", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190915075201-country-music-cash-and-carter-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
