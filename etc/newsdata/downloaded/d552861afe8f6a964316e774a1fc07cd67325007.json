Autumn Nicole Walker\n\n\u201cA winter bride tends to have a really different attitude to her wedding dress than the bride who gets married in the summer,\u201d Brear says.\n\n\u201cOften the winter bride favours a more directional fashion led look and really wants to be more covered. Looks I recommend for autumn tend to involve lots of styling additions, you can really go to town when you don\u2019t need to consider being too hot!\u201d\n\nWhile picking a winter wedding wardrobe is supposed to be fun, the dress still needs to tick a lot boxes, from being chic yet warm to holding up against the elements while still maintaining a sense of occasion.\n\nConfused? Don\u2019t be because luckily for you and your what-to wear woes, we\u2019ve spoken to several industry experts about the must-have trends to keep in mind when honing in on your style for the aisle.\n\nSay \u201cI do\u201d in separates\n\nBridal separates are having a moment right now with big, swooshy ballgown skirts being paired with crop tops, jackets and even caftans.\n\nAdding layers is one of the most practical and stylish ways to weather-proof your wedding day outfit, with many deigners now offering detachable sleeves, tops and overskirts that will work for the service and can be removed or swapped out ready for an evening of dancing.\n\nHowever, according to Rock the Frock, an alternative bridal boutique based in Essex, the coolest way a bride can greet her groom down the aisle is dressed as a superhero.\n\n\u201cCapes are fast becoming more and more popular, as it gives a different option for the bride in terms of styling. Particularly as the length of the cape can be altered, as well as the colour and the embellishment.\u201d\n\nKate Halfpenny, the founder of British luxury bridalwear brand Halfpenny London, agrees adding that the need for extra layers doesn't mean you have to be weighed down by heavy fabrics.\n\n\u201cAs the season changes, I find my brides reaching for something to cover up some of their skin, nothing too heavy. It seems not about warmth but a light coverage,\u201d Halfpenny says.\n\n\u201cIn our new Songbird collection we have a gorgeous tulle cape which is perfect for covering the shoulders and taking something that would look very summery and light into more of an autumn look.\u201d\n\nStatement sleeves\n\nWedding dresses with sleeves aren\u2019t exactly a novel idea but they are given a new lease of life at this time of year as the temperatures justify the desire for a bride to cover her arms.\n\nFashion loves a statement and this season it has translated to bridal in brand-new ways with Alice Temperley, founder of Temperley Bridal, extolling the virtues of OTT sleeves.\n\n\u201cA bride should look like herself on the day, so choose a dress that reflects your personal style even when there is a change of season,\u201d Temperley says.\n\n\u201cHowever, sleeves can add drama to a dress such as a bell or long sleeve and help take away any chill.\u201d\n\nRock the Frock agrees, adding that whether you opt for dainty lace for decorative coverage or cashmere for total cosiness, you\u2019re guaranteed to be on trend with a sleeve throughout the coming months and into next season.\n\nThe best part? With showstopping sleeves, you can probably skip the need for a fussy veil or heavy earrings if you so wish.\n\nSkip the white wedding\n\nWhile colourful wedding dresses are commonplace on the runway at Bridal Fashion Week, the concept is yet to catch on in the mainstream.\n\nHowever, designers are doing their best to change that. While Temperley recommends embracing the soft autumnal colour palette that comes with the new season through intricate details in your dress, Brear suggests going for opulent golds.\n\n\u201cBrides tend to also be more daring in the winter opting for metallics with our gold Nyika dress a best seller for this time of year thanks to its relaxed kimono style which covers the arms but still gives plenty of skin with its cut away front,\u201d Brear says.\n\nForgoing the tradition of a white wedding is certainly catching on with a recent study by wedding venue Newbury Racecourse discovering that almost 40 per cent of Brits agree that the custom is under threat of disappearing.\n\nLift the veil\n\nYou might have chosen your wedding dress but the sartorial dilemmas don\u2019t stop there.\n\nAccessories are a great way to add a finishing touch to your bridal look and, while traditional veils promise to add a touch of old world drama to your ensemble, more and more brides are skipping them in favour of more stylish alternatives like headbands.\n\n\u201cAccessories are key for styling, headbands adorned with gold detailing and floral detailing are popular amongst our brides as it can help tie together the entire theme of the wedding by adding a pop of colour,\u201d Rock the Frock says.\n\nWed2B, a nationwide bridal retailer with stores across the UK, agrees, adding that many of its autumn/winter brides are switching to more subtle hair accessories.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to accessories many brides are choosing to echo the beautiful autumnal leaves outside with a pretty hair vines or delicate hair pins,\u201d Wed2B says.", "description": "While spring and summer might seem like an obvious choice when it comes to booking a date for your big day, more and more brides-to-be are choosing to say \u201cI do\u201d in the golden months of autumn.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/15/halfpenny-songbird-editorial283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
