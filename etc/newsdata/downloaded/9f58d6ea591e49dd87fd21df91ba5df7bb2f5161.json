The only encouragement for the runners came from team delegates and reporters near the finish line.\n\nParaguay\u2019s Derlys Ayala hared off at the start and gave himself a 150 metre-lead over the rest of the field within the first kilometre. He managed to keep the lead for around an hour before being swallowed by the pack and then dropping out.\n\nEventually, Desisa, Geremew, Kipruto, Stephen Mokoka and Zersenay Tadese broke away from the rest and took control of the race.\n\nAfter several kilometres of cat and mouse, they were caught by Dawkins with three kilometres left to set up an enthralling finish.\n\nMokoka and Tadese were the first to be dropped before Dawkins also lost contact around one kilometre from the end. Kipruto was also unable to keep up and it ended with Desisa charging away to claim the gold.\n\n\u201c(I\u2019m) gutted,\u201d said Hawkins. \u201cMaybe I just gave too much in the middle stages. But I couldn\u2019t do any more.\u201d", "description": "Lelisa Desisa ended an 18-year wait for Ethiopia when he triumphed in a sprint finish against compatriot Mosinet Geremew to win a midnight marathon at the World Athletics Championship on Sunday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437538400&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940OJ", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
