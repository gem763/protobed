They basically suffocated my brother, while they're doing this, they have others holding him down and kicking him and my brother's in handcuffs at this stage,\" she said.\n\nLetsoba told The Xolani Gwala Show on Radio 702 on Wednesday that an autopsy revealed that her brother \"died of unnatural causes due to the physical injuries he sustained\".\n\nBut the City of Johannesburg said it would be premature to speculate on the cause of death.\n\nOn #XolaniGwalaShow NOW Letoaba Selahle, the sister to Tshegofatso Selahle(who died in police custody). She tells me autopsy report is out, it confirmed Tshegofatso died of unnatural causes due to physical injuries he sustained. JMPD next to explain what on earth happened \u2014 Clement Manyathela (@TheRealClementM) 21 August 2019\n\nMMC for Public Safety, Micheal Sun received an interim report from the acting head of the public safety department on Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\n\"It is alleged that on the night in question, the motorist had disregarded a red light at William Nicol Drive and Sandton Drive. The motorist had then failed to stop when indicated to, rather opting to speed off.\n\n\"This resulted in the JMPD giving chase. The motorist is said to have then collided with a curb, resulting in the vehicle stopping in a nearby park. The man in question was allegedly under the influence of alcohol and was arrested by the JMPD,\" Sun said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAfter his arrest, the man told officers that he was having difficulty breathing.\n\n\"The motorist was then taken out of the JMPD vehicle and medical assistance was called onto the scene. Sadly, upon the examination by medical teams arriving on site, the man was declared dead,\" Sun added.\n\nThe City said it would \"be premature to speculate on the precise cause of death\" due to ongoing investigations.\n\nThe Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and the South African Police Services (SAPS) are investigating the incident.\n\n\"I have been assured that the JMPD will give their full co-operation to these investigations.\n\n\"I would like to convey my sincerest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased and [we] wish to extend our hand in assisting the family to overcome this difficult time,\" Sun said.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
