Falwell denied the visit and said the photos were \u201cphoto-shopped,\u201d but one day after the Politico story appeared, the owner of Miami photography firm World Red Eye published even more photos of such an incident. Liberty University does not allow students to engage in co-ed dancing or drinking.\n\nStatement in response to yesterday's @politico story on Jerry Falwell Jr. that included our photographs. Additional photographs of Mr. Falwell and his son are posted here: https://t.co/szq7nAFkP0 pic.twitter.com/Y8t36Qpfqa \u2014 Seth Browarnik (@worldREDEYE) September 10, 2019\n\nFalwell told The Associated Press that he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cdignify the lies that were reported\u201d in Politico\u2019s piece and dismissed the reporter as a \u201clittle boy.\u201d He also said he\u2019s asking the FBI to investigate what he claimed was a \u201ccriminal\u201d smear campaign against him by disgruntled former employees as part of an \u201cattempted coup,\u201d which he further claimed was at least partially motivated by his support for President Donald Trump.\n\nDozens of students at Liberty University protested last Friday in the wake of the Reuters and Politico reports, some calling for an investigation and others defending the university president. Falwell tweeted after the protest that he was \u201cso impressed\u201d with how students behaved at the demonstration. That was a half-hour after he tweeted a meme making fun of people who protest against him.\n\nCorry, the general counsel, provided HuffPost with the university\u2019s lengthy statement in response to the recent media reports. The university alleges that it provided that information \u201con the record\u201d to Politico, Reuters and The Washington Post for their stories.\n\nLiberty University was founded nearly 50 years ago by Falwell\u2019s father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. The senior Falwell was a Southern Baptist pastor, televangelist, Moral Majority leader and political activist who helped fuel the rise of today\u2019s religious right.\n\nFalwell Jr. has followed in the footsteps of his father \u2015 who died in 2007 \u2015 by combining religious, educational and political activities. Liberty, an influential institution in conservative politics, has more than 100,000 students (most of whom are enrolled online, according to Politico).\n\nUnlike his brother, Falwell Jr. never became a pastor. When their father died, Falwell Jr. took over the university while Jonathan Falwell took over Thomas Road Baptist Church, the megachurch in Lynchburg that their father helped found in the 1950s. But in the larger public sphere, Falwell Jr. is still seen as a leader in the evangelical community.\n\nHe is an ardent supporter of Trump, who has divided the evangelical community, with progressive evangelicals and evangelicals of color speaking out against a president they believe doesn\u2019t fit their moral standards. Trump has spoken at Liberty University several times, at one point encouraging students to rally in Washington in support of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSteve Helber/ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump speaks with Jerry Falwell Jr. during commencement ceremonies at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, on May 13, 2017.\n\nBut the recent allegations against Falwell have almost nothing to do with his support for Trump, and the reporting dates back further than the stories published last week.\n\nLast year, BuzzFeed reported that a Florida lawsuit highlighted the relationship between the Falwell family and Giancarlo Granda, a young pool attendant they befriended while staying at a Miami Beach hotel in 2012 and later backed in a business venture involving the purchase of a hostel. Falwell filed an affidavit saying he used his own money to lend $1.8 million to the $4.65 million hostel project, which is co-owned by his son.\n\nIn January, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump\u2019s former personal fixer Michael Cohen hired Liberty employee and private consultant John Gauger to manipulate some polls to favor Trump ahead of his presidential campaign. Half a dozen high-level sources at the university told Politico that Gauger was accompanied by Falwell\u2019s son Trey when traveling to New York to collect payment from Cohen.\n\nIn May of this year, Reuters reported that Cohen \u2015 who helped arrange Falwell\u2019s endorsement of the president during his campaign \u2015 gave Falwell a hand in getting rid of what Cohen reportedly called racy \u201cpersonal\u201d photos in someone else\u2019s possession in 2015. Cohen, who is now in prison, recounted the alleged favor in a March 25 recording secretly made by comedian Tom Arnold and reviewed by Reuters. Falwell declined to comment to the news organization, though he told Todd Starnes of Fox News Radio that there were \u201cno compromising or embarrassing photos.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 27, Reuters reported that Falwell and his wife, Rebecca, helped steer a $1.2 million piece of university property to their personal trainer and Liberty graduate Benjamin Crosswhite. Records reviewed by Reuters showed that Falwell had approved a deal in 2016 to sell Crosswhite an 18-acre fitness facility owned by Liberty. The deal was reportedly financed by the university, with the trainer putting no money down. Liberty told Reuters the deal was beneficial for the school. The university\u2019s response regarding Crosswhite is also detailed in its media statement.", "description": "The political evangelical leader and Trump loyalist is facing multiple allegations about his stewardship of Liberty University.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ec82b2300001c0554b429.jpeg?cache=lxejmjtclr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
