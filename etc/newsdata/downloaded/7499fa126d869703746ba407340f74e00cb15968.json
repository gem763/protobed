Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it.\n\n\"And this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first - I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.\u201d\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nBoth Mr McDonnell and Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Prime Minister's behaviour could end up being challenged in court.\n\nSir Keir - the former Director of Public Prosecutions - told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"I\u2019m sure there will be court proceedings.\n\n\"But the first thing we\u2019re going to do in Parliament is deal with that issue.\n\n\"The second thing is then if he brings in a Bill to implement his deal we will fight amendments on that because the deal is a very very bad deal and it has within it a trapdoor to no deal at the end of next year.\"\n\nBranding the PM \"childlike\", Sir Keir said: \"The law is very clear he should have signed one letter in accordance with the law.\n\n\"He\u2019s being childlike and if I don't think it\u2019ll happen but if we crash out because of what he\u2019s done with the letters in 11 days\u2019 time without a deal he bears personal responsibility for that.\n\n\"That\u2019s the first fight.\"\n\nAsked if the behaviour could be challenged in court, Mr McDonnell added: \"It may well be. Others will decide that matter.\n\n\"But a number of lawyers have already commented that this is seeking to undermine a decision of Parliament and therefore flies in the face of both Parliament and court decisions.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEven Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was \u201cnot very prime ministerial\u201d.\n\nA senior No10 source told the Sunday Telegraph Remain campaigners \"will say this is illegal [but] we don't think it is.\"\n\nBut a former Tory Cabinet minister told the Observer it was \"against the spirit of the Benn Act\u201d, the law which forced him to ask for a delay.\n\nThe ex-minister said: \u201cI think this will end up in the courts again.\n\n\"It will also put government law officers in a very uncomfortable position.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nTwo weeks ago, Scotland's Court of Session ruled against campaigners who wanted an order to stop Boris Johnson \"frustrating\" the delay request with a second letter.\n\nThe UK government won over the court by finally promising, in writing, that it would obey the Benn Act after all. Campaigners could now argue that, in effect, Mr Johnson did not obey the law.\n\nOne prominent Remainer told the Mirror Scotland's Court of Session is due to sit again tomorrow, but there is a difference of opinion.\n\n\"There appear to be two genuine sets of views about the second letter,\" they said.\n\n\"One is the second letter is unlawful, the other is that it\u2019s legally irrelevant.\n\n\"Either way everyone agrees the legally significant one is the first one and the EU will just ignore the other.\"\n\nThey added: \"The fact the Benn letter is unsigned is a total red herring and childish behaviour by Johnson.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Gove said the Government had triggered the next stage of Operation Yellowhammer no-deal plans because the Letwin amendment had increased the chances of leaving without a pact.\n\nNo10 hopes to stage another Meaningful Vote tomorrow on his Withdrawal Agreement, if Commons Speaker John Bercow gives the go-ahead.\n\nBut Mr McDonnell said another vote would be \u201cpointless\u201d and a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d.\n\nThe PM received a boost when former Tory Cabinet Minister Amber Rudd revealed she would back his deal.\n\nDowning Street is expected to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament today, with debates beginning on Tuesday.\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer indicated Labour would back an amendment for a second referendum.", "description": "Campaigners are preparing for a hearing on Monday after Boris Johnson undermined his own request for a Brexit delay by branding it 'corrosive'", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Kiran Ridley", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656217.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Peoples-Vote-Campaign-Rallies-For-Final-Say-On-Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
