The president opened his campaign with a rambling February 5 State of the Union address, in which he declared, \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d A month later, in March, Trump appeared with Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing strongman who recently became Brazil\u2019s president, and announced that \u201cThe twilight hour of socialism has arrived.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nThat was wishful thinking on the president\u2019s part.\n\nThe numbers are in. The president is down. Socialism is up.\n\n\u201cTrump Approval Edges Down to 42%,\u201d read the headline from a May 17 Gallup review of its latest polling on the president\u2019s appeal.\n\nThree days later, Gallup reported that \u201c43% of Americans say socialism would be a good thing for the country.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014after months of attacking socialism, Trump came into mid-May with a 42 percent approval rating while socialism scored a 43. In fairness to Trump, these recent polls have margins of error, and surveys of presidential popularity and ideological alignment measure different apples and oranges. But it is still striking, as Trump\u2019s approval numbers are ticking downward, socialism seems to be holding its own. Indeed, Gallup now notes, \u201cabout four in 10 Americans are accepting of some form of socialism or socialist policies.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even more striking are the measures of who likes socialism. The ideology is narrowly ahead with women, 48 percent of whom say that socialism is good for the country, as opposed to 47 percent who say it\u2019s bad. (Men go 56 percent \u201cbad,\u201d versus 38 percent \u201cgood.\u201d) And the Gallup survey suggests socialism is way ahead with nonwhite Americans, 57 percent of whom say its good for the country, versus just 35 percent who label the ideology bad. Current Issue View our current issue\n\nSocialism is especially popular with young people. Among the Americans aged 18\u201334 who were surveyed by Gallup, 58 percent say it\u2019s good for the country.\n\nSo if the future is female, if America is growing more diverse, and if today\u2019s young people are destined to become more influential in our politics, it is entirely reasonable to suggest that socialism is \u201ctrending.\u201d\n\nGallup\u2019s analysis is correct when it suggests that \u201cAmericans\u2019 views on socialism are complex. While some recent data can easily lend to overstated conclusions, there are marked changes in Americans\u2019 views of socialism when taking a longer, more historical look at the data. However, exactly what Americans mean by the term is nuanced and multifaceted.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. For instance, does it matter if the word \u201cdemocratic\u201d is attached so that the ideology is identified as \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d? That\u2019s how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez identifies, as do many of the new members of city councils and state legislatures who have been elected with the support of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).\n\nThe polls tell us that a good deal of socialism\u2019s appeal has to do with a sense that capitalism isn\u2019t working, and DSA addresses this sentiment. \u201cDemocratic socialism fights inequality by giving power back to the workers through unions and true representation. It overcomes alienation and inequality by strengthening civil rights and building solidarity among the many,\u201d the group argues. \u201cNo system is perfect, but the one we live in now is needlessly cruel and unfair\u2014and millions want something new, something better.\u201d\n\nBut is it imaginable that Americans might choose a democratic socialist over a socialism-bashing president? The latest national survey from the Emerson College polling group has the nation\u2019s best-known democratic socialist, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, beating Trump by eight points. When Trump started his campaign against socialism in February, Emerson\u2019s polling had Sanders leading the president only narrowly: 51-49. Three months into the campaign, Trump\u2019s support has fallen to 46 percent, while the democratic socialist has risen to 54 percent.", "description": "The president is campaigning against socialism.
