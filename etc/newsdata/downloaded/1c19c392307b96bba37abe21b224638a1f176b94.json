More broadly, technical damage has been inflicted, and the bigger-picture backdrop is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nBefore detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, -1.56% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.\n\nAs illustrated, the S&P has registered a sizeable early-October whipsaw.\n\nAmid the volatility, the rally attempt has stalled at the 2,960 mark, a level matching the top of the September gap.\n\nSeparately, recall that major resistance matches the August range top (2,943) and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,938. Monday\u2019s close (2,938.8) matched the inflection point, and selling pressure has surfaced early Tuesday.\n\nSimilarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.19% has struggled to sustain a rally atop notable resistance.\n\nHere again, the index has reversed back under its 50-day moving average, currently 26,470, early Tuesday.\n\nSlightly more broadly, recall that the Dow rallied last week from a successful test of the 200-day moving average.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s COMP, -1.67% backdrop is equally jagged.\n\nIts corresponding rally attempt has stalled near the 8,000 mark, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 7,992.\n\nWidening the view to six months adds perspective.\n\nOn this wider view, the Nasdaq\u2019s six-month backdrop remains the weakest of the big three U.S. benchmarks.\n\nThis was the first index to break back to the former August range, and it subsequently failed a retest of the breakdown point (8,059) from underneath. The Nasdaq\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bearish pending a rally atop this area.\n\nSeparately, the Nasdaq successfully retested its 200-day moving average at the October low, preserving a bullish longer-term bias.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off to a comparably volatile October start.\n\nTo reiterate, the index has struggled to sustain a rally atop the 50-day moving average, currently 26,470.\n\nDelving deeper, recall that an intermediate-term inflection point matches the August range top (26,427) and the bottom of the October gap (26,438).\n\nHere again, the Dow maintained its 200-day moving average at the October low, preserving a bullish longer-term bias.\n\nNot surprisingly, the S&P 500 has registered an equally jagged fourth-quarter start.\n\nTactically, an intermediate-term inflection point matches the August range top (2,943), and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,938, levels also detailed on the hourly chart.\n\nMore broadly, consider that the S&P 500 has alternated ranges across four straight months \u2014 July, August, September and October.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nAs detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks continue to whipsaw amid a prolonged early-October volatility spike.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, technical damage has been inflicted, and the bigger-picture backdrop is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nOn a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite has asserted a bearish intermediate-term bias, while the Dow industrials and S&P 500 have vacillated near key inflection points \u2014 the S&P 2,940, and Dow 26,430 areas.\n\nMoving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has maintained its range bottom.\n\nStill, the subsequent rally attempt has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, and the small-cap benchmark remains capped by its major moving averages. Bearish price action.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has whipsawed at its 200-day moving average, currently 344.00.\n\nHere again, the upturn from the October low has been punctuated by decreased volume.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has reverted to the August range to start October.\n\nOverhead inflection points match the 50-day moving average, currently 293.60, and the May peak (294.95).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the S&P 500 has more or less nailed major resistance.\n\nAs detailed repeatedly, an intermediate-term inflection point matches the August range top (2,943) and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,938.\n\nMonday\u2019s close (2,938.8) matched the inflection point, and respectable selling pressure has surfaced early Tuesday.\n\nTactically, the S&P\u2019s backdrop supports a bearish intermediate-term bias to the extent it\u2019s capped by the 2,940 area.\n\nConversely, the August gap spans from about 2,898 to 2,912 and is followed by the 2,873 support, an area that effectively underpinned last week\u2019s downdraft. (See the hourly chart.)\n\nDelving deeper, the 200-day moving average, currently 2,845, is followed by the 2,817 support, a level defining the late-2018, mini-crash range top. The S&P 500\u2019s longer-term bias remains bullish barring a violation of these areas.\n\nAlso see: Charting a shaky October start, S&P 500 challenges key support.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Watch List\n\nThe charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.\n\nDrilling down further, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, -2.62% remains a pocket of relative strength.\n\nTechnically, the group is rising from a bullish ascending triangle pinned to the May low.\n\nWithin the pattern, the 50-day moving average closely matches trendline support, circa 115.50. A breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Delving deeper, major support matches the 110 mark, an area also illustrated on the three-year chart.\n\nConversely, the range top matches the group\u2019s record peak. Eventual follow-through higher opens the path to an intermediate-term target in the 132 area.\n\nMoving to specific names, Dow 30 component Apple, Inc. AAPL, -1.17% continues to act well technically.\n\nAs illustrated, the shares have tagged 52-week highs, reaching the 230 projected target, detailed repeatedly. (See the Sept. 9 review, and the Oct. 1 review.)\n\nMonday\u2019s session high (229.93) closely matched the target. Apple\u2019s slightly more distant all-time high (233.47) \u2014 established Oct. 3, 2018 \u2014 is increasingly within view.\n\nTactically, a near-term floor matches the breakout point, circa 217.00, and is followed by trendline support roughly matching the 210 inflection point. Apple\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains firmly bullish barring a violation.\n\nTJX Companies, Inc. TJX, -0.56% is a well positioned large-cap retailer. (Yield = 1.7%.)\n\nTechnically, the shares have staged an orderly pullback from the range top, an area matching record territory, also illustrated on the three-year chart.\n\nTactically, the 50-day moving average has marked an inflection point, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. A near-term target projects to the 60 area on follow-through.\n\nProfiled Aug. 29, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, -0.11% has returned 17.6% and remains well positioned.\n\nThe shares initially spiked three weeks ago, knifing to 12-year highs after the company reported strong preliminary quarter-to-date new orders.\n\nThe ensuing pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to build on the initial breakout. Tactically, the top of the gap (42.00) closely matches the range bottom, and the prevailing uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.\n\nFinally, PriceSmart, Inc. PSMT, -0.35% is a well positioned discount retailer.\n\nLate last month, the shares gapped sharply higher, rising after the Sept. 23 announcement that the company will be added to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. (PriceSmart was subsequently added to the index on Sept. 26.)\n\nThe ensuing pullback places the shares 11% under the September peak. Tactically, the top of the gap (65.25) closely matches the breakout point, and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.\n\nStill well positioned\n\nThe table below includes names recently profiled in The Technical Indicator that remain well positioned.
