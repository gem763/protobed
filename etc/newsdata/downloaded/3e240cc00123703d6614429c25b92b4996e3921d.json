You've made your point on that. Unless you want to make it hundreds of times.\"\n\nHolly Willoughby then asked if the decision by Extinction Rebellion to not conduct further tube disruption was an \"admission you got it wrong this time\".\n\nSarah then turned the tables on This Morning and insisted they needed stronger action after being \"bumped\" from the This Morning line-up.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe replied: \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got it wrong necessarily because today I\u2019m sitting in this studio and we\u2019ve been bumped three times from This Morning in the last 10 days.\n\n\"It's taken us to be this disruptive to get on your programme to talk about the emergency that we're facing.\"\n\nStunned Phil said: \"Is that why you did it?\"\n\nAdmitting he didn't want to interrupt her, Phil added: \"So that man glued his hand to one electric train for his grandchildren and so you could get on This Morning?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nSarah claimed they were bumped for not being \"newsworthy enough\" so their methods had worked.\n\nPhillip then suggested that someone was going to get hurt during the protests.\n\nDefending their actions, Sarah said: \"Your analysis may be right. Someone may get hurt.\n\n\"The activist today realised the risk they were in. They felt they needed to do that. We are watching life on earth dying.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis Morning viewers raced to Twitter to defend Phillip against Sarah.\n\nOne viewer said: \"How can this women sit there and talk like that to Phillip Schofield?????? Behaving like that isn\u2019t going to get her anywhere.... hahahah what a delusional woman\"\n\n\"Phillip Schofield is doing bits against this #ExtintionRebellion protester - she hasn\u2019t got a clue,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Phillip is making a mug of this extinction rebellion on this morning, thoroughly enjoying it\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Phillip Schofield clashed with the Extinction Rebellion co-ordinator, who said crippling the tube network was necessary after they were bumped from This Morning three times", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_This-Morning-Extinction-Rebellion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
