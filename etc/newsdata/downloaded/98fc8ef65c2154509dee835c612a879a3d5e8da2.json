And lobbying groups for beef producers are calling out some plant-based producers\u2019 marketing tactics.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe they should be able to use the term beef, and they should be marketing their products on the positive attributes of their products, and not by disparaging our products \u2013 specifically Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat,\u201d Colin Woodall, CEO of the Colorado-based National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, a trade group, told FOX Business Tuesday, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t use the term beef, because you\u2019re not beef.\u201d\n\nBeyond Meat and Impossible Foods, the makers of plant-based burgers on sale at grocery stores and at fast-food chains like Burger King, White Castle, Dunkin and KFC, target meat-eating consumers looking to eat less meat and diversify their protein intake. Their products are marketed as being environmentally friendly alternatives.\n\nImpossible Foods and Beyond Meat did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThere have been 45 bills introduced in 27 states aimed at challenging food labeling of plant-based products to not allow them to call their foods meat or milk, the Journal reported.\n\nSales of plant-based milk including varieties like soy, almond, oat and others have grown 6 percent over the past year, now making up 13 percent of the entire milk category, according to data from The Good Food Institute and Plant Based Foods Association. Sales of cow\u2019s milk, meanwhile, have declined 3 percent, according to the same report.\n\n\u201cLabeling integrity is important for consumers to understand what something is, and what something isn\u2019t. Milk is a much more nutritious beverage than its plant-based imitators, and their misuse of dairy terms misleads consumers into thinking those beverages benefit them in ways they do not,\u201d Alan Bjerga, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation said in an email.\n\nSome states have recently imposed stricter food labeling laws that side with the animal agriculture industry. Arkansas lawmakers created a food labeling law earlier this year that forbids companies from using meat names like burgers and sausages if the product isn\u2019t actually made from animal products.\n\nAs a result, Tofurky, the faux-meat substitute made from imitation turkey and tofu, sued the state of Arkansas on Monday over its labeling law, asking a federal judge to temporarily put it on hold, arguing that consumers understand that veggie burgers aren\u2019t real beef and that alternative dairy products, like almond milk, don\u2019t come from cows. Tofurkey has not changed its labels.\n\nThe law would impose a $1,000 fine on plant-based or alternative meat products that are packaged and marketed as meat, like \u201ctofu dogs\u201d or \u201cveggie burgers,\u201d despite also being labeled as vegetarian or vegan.\n\nAdvocates for plant-based foods have said the proposed state laws are a violation of the First Amendment's right to freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cThese laws are unconstitutional. The First Amendment protects labels as long as they\u2019re truthful and not misleading. All of these labels are using proper qualifiers like veggie and plant-based. This idea that consumers are confused is ridiculous,\u201d Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, said. \u201cThere\u2019s no consumer complaint; the complaining is only being done by the industry that\u2019s threated by the competition.\u201d\n\nWoodall says the rise of plant-based foods has posed increased competition for the meat industry.\n\n\u201cWe do see them as being as a force. You can\u2019t watch TV without seeing an Impossible Whopper ad. We know there is demand for their product, we do see them as a competitor. We welcome them as competitors as long as they\u2019re going to be upfront with the consumer. If we level the playing field we welcome the competition,\u201d Woodall said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Cattle ranchers and dairy farmers want plant-based producers to stop labeling products as meat and milk.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/food-wars-2.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
