The launch was first deferred to October 2018, then delayed by a further six months.\n\nIn late April 2019, the inaugural overnight rail journey from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London using the new trains arrived in the English capital over three hours late because of Network Rail problems.\n\nIn June 2019, \u201cwheel flats\u201d were responsible for a series of train cancellations.\n\nThere have also been repeated complaints about the lack of hot food on some services.\n\nWhile the Edinburgh and Glasgow trains, known as the Lowland sleeper, now have the new Spanish-built trains, on the \u201cHighlander\u201d services to and from elsewhere in Scotland 40-year-old carriages are still being used.\n\nSerco says it hopes to have the new rolling stock running across its network by the end of September \u2013 though this may be affected by the strike.\n\nThe union says the train operator has \u201creneged on pledges to address a raft of serious concerns raised by staff\". It claims that these issues \u201chave ruined working lives and placed the workforce under intolerable pressure\u201d.\n\nIt has also instructed members not to work overtime or on rest days, and not to act up to cover for higher-grade colleagues, from Wednesday 2 October.\n\nThe RMT says: \u201cMiddle management have been openly hostile to finalising a settlement.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201dRMT members have been put under intolerable personal stress as a result of the company's mismanagement of the sleeper service.\n\n\u201cThey know it, they have promised to do something about it but they have failed to deliver. The move to strike action is entirely Serco's fault and the public will understand that. Everyone knows that when it comes to failure they are global specialists.\u201d\n\nBut Ryan Flaherty, Serco\u2019s managing director of the Caledonian Sleeper, hit back, saying: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed and frustrated at this industrial action by the RMT, but most of all we are bemused as they have been unable to explain what will bring this dispute to a resolution.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that the problems we had introducing the Lowland Sleeper were challenging for everyone involved and we are very grateful to all our staff for their efforts and the way they rose to meet the challenge, but we are pleased that in the past weeks the situation has been steadily improving.\n\n\u201cThis action is completely unnecessary and we urge the RMT to come back and tell us what they want. We are ready to go to mediation and hold further discussions.\u201d\n\nOnline searches by The Independent suggest that all trains on 29 and 30 September have been taken off sale.\n\nThe RMT has also called an overtime ban on CrossCountry trains from Friday 27 September to Tuesday 1 October, inclusive, over what it calls \u201cbreaches to the collective bargaining agreements\u201d.", "description": "Sunday 29 September looks like being a troubled day for many travellers by air and now rail.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/13/09/caledoniansleepernew.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
