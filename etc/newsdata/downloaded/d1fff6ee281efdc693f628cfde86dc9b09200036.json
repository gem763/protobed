And the same is true for other activities that do damage, such as murder. I don\u2019t see why I should have to reduce the number of people I hack to pieces, when Isis won\u2019t cut down on their slaughter rates. I\u2019m just being made a fool of.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis must be why our prime minister dismissed the protesters, with his typically well-crafted prose, honed and polished through years of studying classics in the finest school in the world, when he said they were \u201ccrusties\u201d who live in \u201chemp-smelling bivouacs\u201d.\n\nIn a few neatly chiselled words, he refuted their premise. The teachers and bus drivers, the retired civil servant who said on the news \u201cI\u2019ve never protested before but we have to do something for our grandchildren\u201d and Benedict Cumberbatch and all the others, it turns out, live in bivouacs too. This is enough to invalidate anything they say about fossil fuels, but it\u2019s not just any bivouac they live in, it\u2019s ones that stink of hemp.\n\nMaybe Boris Johnson took into account the great debate of the Ancient Greeks, when Plato argued all earthly life was an imperfect copy of a perfect God, and Aristotle disproved this, by arguing \u201cYou live in a hemp-smelling bivouac, you stinky f****r\u201d, and that settled it.\n\nThe International Panel on Climate Change have made their calculations. They have analysed carbon emissions and their impact upon climate, the ice sheets in Greenland, the diminishing Gulf Stream and its likely effect on air pressure and sea levels, but what they haven\u2019t told us is how many of them live in hemp-smelling bivouacs, because we can write off all the graphs made by those pungent crusties for a start.\n\nTo be fair, Johnson has an admirable record in investing in new industries that reduce energy consumption. While he was mayor he funded a technology company so determined to use as little energy as possible, that it didn\u2019t actually exist, so he should be given credit for that.\n\nMaybe he should get that woman who received the money to run all the other companies, such as Shell and Ford. They\u2019d get rid of all their factories and oilfields and replace them with a dancing pole in a flat, and we\u2019d reach our carbon emissions target by Christmas.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

So they\u2019re told, \u201cif you really cared about the environment, you\u2019d cut down on your own consumption, by killing yourself with a whittled twig and laying in the woods to be eaten by badgers\u201d.\n\nThis has become more difficult now the movement\u2019s global leader is Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. So middle-aged millionaire businessmen find themselves saying \u201cthis girl is a sickening narcissistic disruptive menace obsessed with her own image, as I agreed with my good friend Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nThe stardom of Thunberg has already reshaped society, partly because middle-class parents ambitious for their kids no longer force them to rehearse a solo on the oboe all night. Instead, they scream \u201ccome on, you\u2019ll never get a Nobel Peace prize if you don\u2019t practice making a speech about the decline of the sea lion while glueing yourself to the wing of a Boeing 737\u201d.\n\nThe trouble is, we\u2019re not helped in the quest to make life more carbon-friendly. For example, a plane from London to Newcastle is usually about 30 quid, whereas the train will be 700 quid unless you book it nine years in advance.\n\nThen, in solidarity with Thunberg\u2019s suffering as she sailed across the ocean, there are 90 people to a seat and the air conditioning is broken. So at least this creates space, as those who suffocate can be thrown off at Peterborough, the water runs out at Watford, and the toilet tries to tell jokes, which is so disheartening that anyone reasonable would decide to wet themselves, as it\u2019s far less uncomfortable. Subsidies for solar panels have also been cut, and you can hardly buy a packet of Hula Hoops without driving to World of Snacks in the Out-of-Town complex off the M40.\n\nSo the protesters can make their point, they should just do it without disrupting anything, maybe by drawing a turtle or looking out of the window. Only then can we contemplate the sacrifices we might have to make \u2013 such as taking less flights \u2013 in order to save the planet. It\u2019s a tricky choice, similar to the sort of dilemma we face every day, such as \u201cI want to live a long healthy life, but on the other hand I really like the taste of crack\u201d.", "description": "The lesson from these Extinction Rebellion protesters, that all sensible people have drawn, is they might be trying to warn us we\u2019re killing off every living thing on the planet, but I COULDN\u2019T GET TO DEBENHAMS, THE BASTARDS, so I appreciate their message about all of us dying but I WAS TRYING TO ORDER A SET OF CURTAINS so they should KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, THE TW**S.", "authors": ["Mark Steel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/10/Extinction-Rebellion-City-Airport-17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
