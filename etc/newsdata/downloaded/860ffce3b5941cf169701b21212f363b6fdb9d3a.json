The lyrics are simply a long list of major personalities and issues that have pleased, pained, and plagued my generation\u2014the Baby Boomers\u2014since our parents started to have children during the late 1940s. The lyrics include brief, rapid-fire allusions to more than 100 domestic and global headlines during the Cold War, from 1949 through 1989. Many of them refer to troublesome events during that period.\n\nToday, Billy Joel would have no trouble updating his list of troublesome events: Red China, North Korea, South Korea, vaccine, Ayatollah\u2019s in Iran, foreign debts, homeless vets, China\u2019s under martial law, impeachment, MMT, negative rates, deflation, inverted yield curve, M-PMI and many more. Actually, the first eight items were in Joel\u2019s original lyrics.\n\nWednesday\u2019s cause for concern was the release of September\u2019s report. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was weak across the board\n\nUS ISM Manufacturing PMI\n\nConsider The Following:(1) Weak, but still no recession. The overall index fell to 47.8 from 49.1 during August. These are the first readings below 50.0 since 2016. There was no recession back then. The latest readings don\u2019t signal a recession now according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which conducts the PMI survey:\n\nA PMI\u00ae above 42.9 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the September PMI\u00ae indicates growth for the 125th consecutive month in the overall economy, and the second month of contraction following 35 straight months of growth in the manufacturing sector. The past relationship between the PMI\u00ae and the overall economy indicates that the PMI\u00ae for September (47.8 percent) corresponds to a 1.5-percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis.\n\n(2) Regional surveys also mostly down and out. The three major components of the M-PMI were all below 50.0 during September: (47.3), production (47.3), and (46.3), as Debbie reviews below. The weakness in the M-PMI was confirmed by the composite and orders averages for the regional business surveys conducted by five Federal Reserve district banks.\n\nNational And Regional Manufacturing\n\nHowever, the regional average employment index rebounded during September, while the of the M-PMI fell to the lowest reading since January 2016.\n\nNational, Regional (blue) Manufacturing Employment\n\n(3) Trade war hits exports index. Also standing out on the weak side was the M-PMI\u2019s new exports component, which plunged from last year\u2019s peak of 62.8 during February to 41.0 during September.\n\nManufacturing Exports, Imports (red)\n\nThat was the lowest reading since March 2009. Trump\u2019s escalating trade war has depressed US exports, according to the latest ISM survey. The imports index, however, edged up from 46.0 during August to 48.1 last month.\n\n(4) Bad news for revenues. The growth rate in S&P 500 aggregate revenues, on a y/y basis, is highly correlated with the M-PMI.\n\nS&P 500 Revenues And Manufacturing (blue)\n\nSeptember\u2019s reading for the latter suggests that the former could turn negative. That would imply negative earnings growth too. Aggregate revenues were up 3.0% during Q2.\n\nThe good news is that aggregate revenues growth is also highly correlated with the , which remained above 50.0 in September for the 122nd month, though is showing a slowdown in service-sector growth. September\u2019s reading fell to a three-year low of 52.6 from 56.4 in August and a recent peak of 60.8 a year ago. However, ISM notes that an NM-PMI above 48.6, over time, generally indicates an expansion in the overall economy.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Ed Yardeni covering: S&P 500.
