Louise Kennerley\n\n\"What they are going to do at the front is exactly what we would have done,\" says former mayor Sally Betts.\n\n\"What's ironic is the previous opposition was calling it a privatisation yet there is more commercial in the new plan than we proposed,\" says Liberal councillor Leon Goltsman, who expects to vote for the plan.\n\nThe Pavilion is where Bondi's tourism industry runs into its proprietorial residents.\n\nThe building is a centre of community activity. Dance classes, pottery firing, singalongs and film festivals are all held there. For the 35,000 people who can visit the beach on a hot day, the building offers the closest shade, refreshments and toilets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabor and Greens activists cleverly framed the plan to provide more services for the latter as an attack on the former. \"Makeover not takeover,\" read a banner draped from the Pavilion.\n\nPlaying on local anti-tourist sentiment, the campaign was led by Kilty O'Brien, the daughter of former Greens senator Lee Rhiannon.\n\nRealising the community was confused by the plan, the Liberals scaled back the development from $36 million to around $15 million and dropped the restaurant.\n\nThe shift was too late to change public perception. The Liberals lost control of Waverley Council in September 2017, and Wakefield became mayor. One of his first acts was to rip up his predecessor's Pavilion plan.\n\nRate rises\n\nWakefield, a co-founder of CPM property research, was replaced last month by a fellow Labor councillor and a former director of SBS radio, Paula Masselos.\n\nAround the same time, Waverley Council lodged detailed plans for the Pavilion with itself, which suggests they will be approved. Among the changes will be the conversion of an internal courtyard, which is used as a car park, into a paved park for bathers to shelter on hot days. The idea was a centrepiece of the original plan.\n\nThe Save Bondi Pavilion organisation has celebrated the new proposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I am proud of this project and that we are delivering on what the community asked us to do,\" Masselos says.\n\nWaverley, which extends from Bronte to Vaucluse, covers some of Sydney's most Instagrammed and valuable real estate. The council's healthy financial base hasn't been matched by budget discipline, which raises the level of risk in relation to the $26 million renovation.\n\nThe popular Icebergs swimming pool at Bondi Beach. Louise Kennerley\n\nRates have increased by 77 per cent since 2004, twice the rate of inflation. Because of spending on projects such as the Pavilion, the council's financial reserves are forecast to fall from $161 million to $66 million by 2025-26.\n\nWithout extra borrowing or a special rate increase - which council officers suggested be dubbed an environmental levy - the municipality will be vulnerable to an unexpected crisis, a council report this year concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pavilion will have to be closed for the mostly cosmetic work. The potential to create a great asset for the city's third most popular destination will have been lost, and taxes will likely go up.\n\nAs Australians debate how to grow the economy, tourism is regarded as one of the great successes.\n\nSometimes, though, a perverse incentive of local politics - to kill developments that would leave more people better off - undermines the national good.", "description": "The campaigners who fought against privatisation of Bondi's Pavilion are turning to private enterprise for financial support.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8660dd7652b7e761fbf910c3019ee510101d9b43", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
