Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), in particular, has been in contact with Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhen reached for comment about the vice presidential buzz, a Warren campaign official said, \u201cthat is baseless and not at all true.\u201d\n\nBut two sources said the talks between Warren and Gillum resemble the kind of courtship that happens when a leading presidential candidate is exploring potential vice presidential contenders. One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that there is a \u201cstrong impression\u201d that Gillum is a possible vice presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a frontrunner in the 2020 primary, the source said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d a second source familiar with the conversations said.\n\nOthers said the conversations are broader in scope and that Gillum, who narrowly lost a gubernatorial bid by less than a half a point to Republican Ron DeSantis in 2018, is a key player in the biggest battleground state, which President Donald Trump won by less than two percentage points in 2016.\n\nA source close to Gillum\u2019s political team would not confirm specific talks, but stated that Gillum is in communication with many of the candidates and noted that Florida is a critical state to win the presidency.\n\nBut hours after The Daily Beast posted this story, Gillum tweeted, \"Many of my friends running to beat @realDonaldTrump call me often \u2014 about one thing: how to win Florida.\"\n\nHe then included a pitch and a link to his new effort to register 1 million new voters in Florida.\n\nGillum, 40, ran a tight race that attracted significant national attention in the height of the 2018 midterm elections, even bringing in former President Barack Obama to rally for him in Miami. But his race was dogged by Trump\u2019s outsized influence in Florida and Trump himself, who attacked Gillum as a \u201csocialist\u201d and a \u201cstone cold thief\u201d in reference, Trump said on Fox News, to a federal corruption probe that ensnared top officials in Tallahassee. Gillum maintained that he was not the focus of the investigation and had done nothing wrong.\n\nBut even after his loss to DeSantis, Gillum\u2019s name was among the rising Democratic stars listed as potential presidential material. After his announcement in March that he would not run for president, his name has continued to be part of the national conversation, primarily centered on his voter registration effort.\n\nIn 2018, several Democrats\u2014who later launched 2020 bids\u2014played an active role in boosting Gillum\u2019s campaign. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom have been in touch with Gillum in recent months. Warren recorded a video endorsement for Gillum during his race, saying, \u201cAndrew\u2019s the leader the Sunshine State needs.\u201d\n\nBetsy Woodruff Swan contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d a source familiar with the conversations said.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570734954/191010-trudo-warren-vp-tease_bwhaza", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
