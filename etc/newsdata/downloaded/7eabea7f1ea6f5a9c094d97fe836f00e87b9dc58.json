I really feel the burden of guilt.\u201d\n\nAnother person that burden weighs on is Phillip Lane, a builder and army veteran who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\n\nIn recent years the grandfather of eight has become increasingly alarmed by the weather in his hometown of Marsden in West Yorkshire.\n\n\u201cWe used to get snow every year for one or two weeks at a time,\u201d the 66-year-old said.\n\n\"If it does snow at all now it doesn\u2019t settle. It\u2019s just slush.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n\u201cI find it very strange and extremely unsettling. It\u2019s the same temperature all year round now.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to raise awareness about climate change Phillip has twice got himself arrested.\n\nWhile he found his two 22 hours stints in a cell unpleasant, he still plans on throwing himself into future actions at Leeds Bradford Airport and in Huddersfield.\n\n\u201cMy grandkids are between ten months and eight years old, and I just want them to have a decent life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government is failing us, but I feel optimistic we can get them to approach this (climate change) differently.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare my grandkids, but the weather is not going to go back to how it was. All we can do now is mitigate the damage.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nJudy Hardman is a granny of two who joined XR last October after reading the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s report.\n\nShe was scared by the panel\u2019s prediction that only 12 years remained before devastating global heating wreaks irreversible environmental havoc.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent to me we have such a very small amount of time left to stop this,\u201d the Gloucester woman said.\n\n\u201cBack then my oldest granddaughter Rosa was 3. She will be 15 at the point when we can do nothing to stop runaway climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a social worker by profession, and social work is all about protecting children from harm.\n\n\u201cI need to tell her I tried to do something.\"\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nFor the 65-year-old doing something came in the form of her first ever act of civil disobedience in April, when she refused police orders to leave Parliament Square.\n\nFor 80-year-old John Scott doing something means spending the time he \u201chas left\u201d raising XR\u2019s profile.\n\nThe former Merchant Navy captain has twice been arrested to that end - once while blocking Waterloo Bridge, once while on the way to shut down London City Airport.\n\nDespite finding himself on the wrong side of the law, he continues to have \u201cthe greatest respect\u201d for police officers who handled him \u201cprofessionally, correctly and gently\u201d.\n\nJohn\u2019s motivation to keep getting arrested stems, as for most of the XR Grandparents, from a fear of leaving a toxic legacy.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are blessed with enough health and energy to enjoy ourselves at our home in Dartmouth,\u201d he said.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n\u201cBut it has become apparent to us that in the time we have left we have to raise the profile of climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the major issue facing humanity and life on Earth.\n\n\u201cYou have to stand up and be counted, particularly at my age. The consequences are less for me.\u201d\n\nWhile the grandfather of eight and great-grandfather of three is aware of the challenges the movement faces, he is positive.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t overburden young people into thinking the planet we\u2019re on is doomed,\u201d he said when asked about whether XR\u2019 arguments are alarmist.\n\n\u201cBut these are real problems that will affect us all.\n\n\u201cI am quietly hopeful that as more and more people become aware of the problems we have to face, there will be a rising tide of people demanding change.\n\n\"Small commitments like using less plastic and walking more are just as important, but the change has to be led by the government.\u201d", "description": "Grannies and grandads have picketed outside the Queen's home in central London in Extinction Rebellion's latest call for action", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Tim Merry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586525.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Extinction-Rebellion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
