He's really pushing forward.'\n\nThis Question Time audience member sparked a huge reaction last night when he claimed Boris Johnson was 'knocking things out of the park and people just can't stand it'\n\nBy 9am this morning, a clip of those comments which was posted on the BBC's Question Time Twitter feed had got 3,000 likes and more than 500 retweets.\n\nSome of those who watched commented 'spot on mate' and 'well said that man'.\n\nTwitter user Mark Hussell posted: 'Absolutely correct. There are massive amounts of bitterness and jealousy involved.'\n\nBut some were less impressed by other comments on Ireland which the man went on to make on the show, which were not included in the BBC's tweet.\n\nHe said he was tired of the conversation about Brexit revolving solely around arrangements in Northern Ireland, and suggested that maybe the solution was to have 'an island of Ireland'.\n\nA clip of the man's comments on Twitter quickly collected 3,000 likes, with some of those responding praising his comments\n\nBut others were less impressed and accused of BBC of carefully editing a clip on Twitter\n\nNone of those on the Question Time panel took the time to explain whether or why they were opposed to a united Ireland. SNP MP Philippa Whitford responded with comments about Scottish independence, minister Matt Hancock responded by praising Boris Johnson and Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney used the question to attack other parties.\n\nBut commenters on Twitter were angry that the BBC had posted only the section of the man's comments in which he praised Boris Johnson, and not his remarks on Ireland.\n\nLeft-wing critics claimed the editing was an example of the corporation's bias, while others claimed the man was a 'Tory plant' in the audience.", "description": "The man, who appeared when the flagship BBC show broadcast from Leicester last night, said he supported the Prime Minister and felt he was doing a good job.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19874056-0-image-a-17_1571385625804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
