The storm\u2019s strongest winds are usually close to the eye.\n\nAt least five people were killed in the Abaco Islands, in the northern Bahamas, Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told a news conference on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of our northern Bahamas,\u201d Minnis said. \u201cOur mission and focus now is search, rescue and recovery.\u201d\n\nHe added that the U.S. Coast Guard was on the ground in Abaco and had rescued a number of injured individuals. Critically injured people were being taken to hospitals on New Providence, the country\u2019s most populous island.\n\nA Reuters witness staying in the hotel at the Abaco Beach Resort on the island of Great Abaco said winds tore off the shutters and part of the roof, and the site was surrounded by a lake of water.\n\nDorian threatened to unleash a storm surge that could raise water levels by as much as 12 to 18 feet (4-5 metres) above normal on Grand Bahama Island, the NHC said.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.\n\nRelated Coverage Floridians evacuate and grumble as Hurricane Dorian slowly nears\n\nHouses in a neighbourhood in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island were engulfed by 6 feet (1.8 m) of water. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re boats on top of the water,\u201d said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter.\n\nThe hurricane, which was downgraded late Monday morning to Category 4 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, packed maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour (240 kph), the NHC said.\n\nDorian was expected to drift to the northwest late on Tuesday and stalk the coasts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia, it said.\n\nStrong gusts and high surf were already being reported along Florida\u2019s east coast as the hurricane was about 105 miles (170 km) from West Palm Beach, the NHC said.\n\nAt the White House, staff members reviewed hurricane planning with state and local officials. President Donald Trump was being briefed hourly, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nEVACUATIONS\n\nNine counties in Florida have issued mandatory evacuations. They included parts of Duval County, home to Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis urged coastal residents to heed evacuation orders. \u201cGet out now while there\u2019s time and while you have fuel available,\u201d he told a news conference from the state\u2019s emergency operations centre in Tallahassee.\n\nAmong those being evacuated was Sue Watson, a 93-year-old resident of a retirement community in Kissimmee in central Florida.\n\nStrong winds batter Oceanhill Boulevard in Freeport, as Hurricane Dorian passes over Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas September 2, 2019 in this still image taken from a video by social media. Lou Carroll via REUTERS\n\n\u201cI was all set to stay home until they had to turn the water off,\u201d said Watson, who added she was not worried for her personal safety but hoped the storm spared the retirement community.\n\nThe storm was causing havoc for travellers on Florida\u2019s east coast, where some airports and gasoline stations were closed.\n\nOrlando International Airport, one of the largest in the state, planned to cease commercial operations at 2 a.m. on Tuesday because of the storm, it said in a statement.\n\nWalt Disney World Resort (DIS.N) in Orlando will close early on Tuesday, it said in a statement.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it cancelled 55 flights scheduled for Monday and Tuesday after airports in Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Melbourne and Daytona Beach closed.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL.O) said operations had been suspended at seven airports in Florida and the Bahamas, and a travel alert issued for more than 20 airports including in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations for parts of eight coastal counties effective at noon on Monday. More than 830,000 people were under evacuation orders in Charleston and other coastal communities in the state, emergency management officials announced.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered evacuations in six coastal counties, including all of Savannah\u2019s 150,000 residents, also effective at noon on Monday, Kemp\u2019s office said on Twitter.\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in his state on Monday, his office said, anticipating the southeast coast could be hit by the storm on Thursday.\n\nDorian was tied with Gilbert (1988), Wilma (2005) and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, based on maximum sustained winds. Allen in 1980 was the most powerful, with 190 miles (306-kph) winds, the NHC said.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nScientists have warned that climate change is making hurricanes more intense. As global warming heats up the ocean surface temperature, storms gather more energy, which can lead to greater rainfall and stronger winds as they make landfall.\n\n\u201cWhen scientists put the pieces together, they project that in general, hurricanes will become more intense in a warming world ... much like we\u2019ve seen recently with Hurricanes Harvey, Michael and Florence,\u201d the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group, said in a blog post about Dorian.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian pounded the Bahamas on Monday, killing at least five people and inundating homes with floodwater ahead of its expected advance on the U.S. coast, where more than a million people were ordered evacuated.", "authors": ["Dante Carrer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425441921&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811B2"}
