Much like the existing Alexa integration, Microsoft is allowing Google Assistant to launch games and apps, turn the console on and off, pause videos, and much more. You\u2019ll need to use the Google Assistant app for iOS or Android or a device like Google\u2019s Home with Assistant on it to control an Xbox One. Google Assistant won\u2019t run on the Xbox One itself; instead, it will receive commands from other devices running Assistant.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to join a Google Group to get access to the Google Assistant support for Xbox One, and then it can be activated through the Google Home app for iOS or Android by setting up a new device and looking for \u201c[beta] Xbox\u201d in the list. Xbox owners will be able to give their console a name within Google Assistant, allowing commands like \u201cHey Google, turn on Xbox\u201d to work.\n\nMicrosoft is rolling this out as a public beta initially over the coming weeks, and the company has a full FAQ and setup instructions on Reddit.", "description": "Xbox One consoles will now support Google Assistant.
