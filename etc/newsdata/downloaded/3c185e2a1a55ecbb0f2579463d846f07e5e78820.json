I have been letting it thaw and using it on sandwiches or with eggs. It stays nice and green as well,' she said\n\nHis play on the term \u2018big pharma\u2019 is a swipe at drug firms which routinely pump money into studies.\n\nThe research, conducted by Penn State University, claimed avocados reduced the number of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in overweight adults.\n\nLDL has been shown to narrow arteries and restrict the flow of blood throughout the body.\n\nThe paper showed less than a 10 per cent reduction in 'bad' cholesterol - but experts say a 50 per cent decrease is required to boost heart health in obese individuals.\n\nThe researchers were also slammed for conducting what is known as \u2018within-group\u2019 comparisons.\n\nThey took cholesterol readings from participants before putting them on an avocado-a-day diet and then again at the end of the trial.\n\nExperts say they should have compared the readings with a control group who were not fed avocados before and after the study, to test the veg's true effect on cholesterol.\n\nWhy you should blend up the avocado STONE and eat it, according to scientists The healthiest part of an avocado could be the pit that most people throw away, a new study suggests. Researchers found that an extract in avocado seeds reduced inflammation caused by white blood cells. They say the findings are evidence that the extract could be turned into a food ingredient, or even used as a pharmaceutical drug. However, experts are skeptical and say the research is in its early stages and that past studies have shown that, if consumed in high quantities, the stone could actually be toxic. Americans eat about seven pounds of avocados a year and the benefits have been long-extolled, including high amounts of healthy fats and several nutrients including vitamin K, folate and potassium. Several studies have shown that the fruit can raise levels of HDL 'good' cholesterol, increase nutrient absorption from other foods and help with weight loss. The yellow-green flesh inside is eaten on everything from salads to toast, but the skins and seeds are generally discarded. A study conducted by Penn State in 2013 found that Aztecs and Mayans would heat or boil the seed to treat a number of illnesses including diabetes, gastrointestinal problems and parasitic infections. Another study from Nigeria in 2009 found that the pit extract was historically used in the African country to manage high blood pressure. However, research has shown that the pit may be toxic. A 2013 Mexican study found that high doses of an extract from the seed were harmful to mice, although it didn't cause genetic damage. And a 1988 study from Israel showed that avocado seed oil increased fat build-up in the livers of rats.\n\nGideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist working on a PhD at the University of Wollongong in Australia, readjusted the findings after excluding \u2018within-group\u2019 data.\n\nHe found the avocados actually lowered LDL by around 4 per cent - a fraction of the 10 per cent originally reported by the researchers.\n\nLDL is just one important type of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is another.\n\nHDL is sometimes called good cholesterol because it helps promote blood flow and reduces one\u2019s risk of heart disease\n\nBut the avocado study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, made little mention of how the vegetable changed the HDL levels.\n\nThis raises suspicion, experts say, as a drop in HDL could indicate an increased risk of heart problems.\n\nThe study, which looked at 45 overweight individuals, also set out to monitor triglycerides levels \u2013 a combination of fats used as an indicator of heart disease risk.\n\nBut it made no mention of these in their findings, which again raised the eyebrow of critics.\n\nDr Meyerowitz-Katz said on Twitter: 'The results were hilariously unimpressive. Avocados reduced LDL ('bad') cholesterol a tiny bit, and changed the levels of a couple of antioxidants a tiny bit as well.\n\n'For reference, the reduction in LDL here is <10 per cent from baseline, while guidelines tend to argue for a 50 per cent reduction if possible.\n\n'So, there was a minimally important reduction in 'bad' cholesterol But here's the funny part - it may not be important at all.\n\n'This is because, like many of these silly food studies, the researchers did a lot of what's known as \"within-group\" comparisons.\n\n'Basically, this means that you compare the avocado diet at the end to the avocado diet at the beginning, rather than the control groups that they had This makes the result a bit meaningless because of regression to the mean (among other things).'\n\nHe said it was 'absurd' to suggest that the tiny changes in cholesterol could be beneficial to normal people in every day life.\n\nDr Meyerowitz-Katz added: 'Remember, these weren't (as the headlines suggest) people just adding avocados to their diets.\n\n'These were people eating carefully controlled, formulated diets centered around avocados.\n\n'It is absurd to suggest that you could take these complex, within-study diets and apply the results to people who are wondering what to eat to be a bit healthier.\n\n'This research was funded by the Hass Avocado Board, the organisation for the most commonly grown avocado in the world (who the senior study author also works for). In other words, BIG AVOCADO.'\n\nThe Penn State study took 45 obese and overweight adults and split them up into three groups.\n\nEach adult took part in five weeks of three separate diets, in a randomly assigned order.\n\nOne followed a low-fat diet, another a moderate-fat diet, and the third a moderate-fat diet that included one avocado per day.\n\nParticipants in the latter group made up for the lack of avocados by eating extra healthy fats designed to mimic the amount of fatty acids found in avocados.", "description": "Critics blasted the Penn State University study which purported to show the vegetable slashed the chance of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels.
