I think it might have been before I wondered if God was real, when I simply knew he was. I have been listening to a podcast lately about Christian pop culture and the music they discuss is the only thing that can take me back there in an instant.\n\nNow that\u2019s what I call church music: which is the best hymn? Read more\n\nI have become obsessed with a song I used to listen to as a child. It\u2019s called Shout to the Lord, and we used to sing it at church most Sundays. Shout to the Lord was written by a woman named Darlene Zschech, from the Hillsong church. Darlene and this song are enduring symbols of my own deep hypocrisy \u2013 so just bear with me.\n\nIf you grew up in evangelical Australian churches you will know this song but, for the uninitiated, the chorus goes:\n\nShout to the Lord, all the Earth, let us sing\n\nPower and majesty, praise to the King\n\nMountains bow down and the seas will roar\n\nAt the sound of your name\n\nVery dramatic, no? Imagine you\u2019re five years old and you hear it for the first time sung by a woman with one of the best voices Australia has heard, Australian Christianity\u2019s Tina Arena, perhaps.\n\nI am 30 now and have spent a lot of time grappling with this music, this church, this King. One night after an all-Christian, all-family dinner at the Sofia pizza and pasta restaurant in Burwood, I search Darlene\u2019s name while sitting in the car park of a Thirsty Camel, where I had just bought the bottle of wine I was not allowed to drink at the all-Christian all-family dinner. I wanted to know what Darlene is doing now. Her home page reads:\n\nI pray that as you find yourself within the pages of this site that you are forever pointed towards our beautiful saviour, Jesus \u2026 Be blessed, know that you are loved and together let\u2019s keep loving Him and loving those in our world.\n\n\n\nLove Darls x\n\nDarls! She calls herself Darls! Of course she does!\n\nDarls now has a blog and a tour dates page and an online shop. In her online shop you can buy her many CDs and there are also T-shirts with the word HOPE written largely and distinctively in a graphic design style I can only describe as Cool Christian Youth Pastor. There is a book titled The Golden Thread. There is a CD called Extravagant Worship and one called Rwanda: Speak! I\u2019m listening.\n\nI Google her book. Ostensibly about her battle with cancer, the Amazon.com blurb reads:\n\nDo you feel like you are barely holding on?\n\n(Darlene, yes!)\n\nLet the golden thread of God\u2019s presence be the calm on the other side of chaos. It could be that he is weaving a brilliant new beginning in the middle of your mess. Join beloved worship leader and songwriter of \u201cShout to the Lord\u201d Darlene Zschech as she traces God\u2019s goodness through her recent transitions.\n\nI have a big mess, and I love that song.\n\nI click on the songs Spotify suggests I might like, the songs below Shout to the Lord. I see a band named Delirious, sometimes spelled Deliriou5, indicating that they aren\u2019t like other Christian bands \u2013 they\u2019re cool. This speaks to me as I\u2019m not like other Christians \u2013 I, too, am cool. I play their track Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble? and Deeper to my friend who I grew up in church with as we shriek along across her dinner table, our heathen partners sitting baffled at our reaction to a song they\u2019ve never heard. I listen to DC Talk\u2019s post-Nirvana rebrand album Jesus Freak and search my bookshelf for the accompanying branded Bible study journal my Dad bought me when the album came out. Keith Green\u2019s Asleep in the Light comes on and I add it to my new Shout to the Lord playlist and cry because I used to think Keith Green was a perfect person and now I suspect he may have been slightly unhinged. His songs though, like Darlene\u2019s, problematic as they may be, are still perfect.\n\nHow I fell (back) in love with singing | Stephanie Convery Read more\n\nI once admitted in therapy, through tears, that I thought it would be very nice to have everyone be impressed by me and how clever and beautiful and perfect I was. No one is perfect at anything, my therapist said. Perhaps my relationship with religion has warped my sense of self, she suggested, but I think she\u2019s wrong. When I read the writing of some of my peers, I think, \u201cWell, that was perfect.\u201d When I hear Darlene sing Shout to the Lord, I think, \u201cAlso perfect.\u201d\n\nI listen to my Shout to the Lord playlist on my commute to my desk job and well up as I pull into my train station, unsure if it\u2019s Darlene, or God, or the fact that I\u2019m about to start work for the day. I log in to my desktop to the sounds of Michael W Smith, Amy Grant and Keith Green and wonder if this is the week I\u2019ll finally find the Golden Thread.\n\n\u2022 Rebecca Varcoe is a writer from Melbourne", "description": "I\u2019m 30 now and have spent a lot of time grappling with this music, this church, this God", "authors": ["Rebecca Varcoe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7e76113d52cba6ebd197a4c63eaec6f881ba0a/0_167_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=264f12080bfad58ea1978278dc74fd4d"}
