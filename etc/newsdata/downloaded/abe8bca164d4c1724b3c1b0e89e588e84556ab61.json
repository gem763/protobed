There were several public toilets that stopped flushing... we were lucky no one got sick, really,\" he said.\n\n\"Then riots broke out on the ship. They pulled out security and they were threatening to arrest several passengers.\"\n\nEmily Lee, who spoke to the programme while still on the ship, said she was \"disappointed\" at the change of itinerary, which left them \"circling\" near Norway.\n\nA spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line said the \"revised itinerary\" was a result of \"weather conditions\", but that it still allowed the ship to call at eight ports, as opposed to the nine that were originally planned.\n\n\"We are very sorry for any inconvenience and disappointment our guests experienced,\" a statement read.\n\n\"We always do our best to provide our guests with a truly enjoyable and memorable vacation, but our very first priority is to ensure their safety and the safety of our crew.\n\nImage copyright Cody McNutt\n\n\"We understand that is it disheartening when we are unable to call to ports that our guests have been looking forward to visiting.\n\n\"However, we ask for their patience, cooperation and understanding. We do the very most we can to call to ports whenever it is safe to do so.\n\n\"Our goal is to showcase the beautiful destinations our ships visit and to provide guests with an onboard experience that is second to none.\"\n\nThe company offered passengers 25% off future cruises, but Mr McNutt said that customers want a full refund.\n\n\"It just infuriated people that they would offer us to go on another trip with them after they had done this to us,\" he said.\n\nKerry Spencer, editor of the review website Cruise Critic, said hazardous seas and inclement weather can often lead to changes in a cruise liner's itinerary.\n\nBut she said it was \"rare for a ship to have to drop numerous ports in one stretch in favour of consecutive sea days\".", "description": "Passengers say they were left \"floating around\" at sea for days during their tour of northern Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AAE2/production/_109164734_cruise1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
