Photographed outside shows like Gabriela Hearst, Christian Cowan, Eckhaus Latta, and Maryam Nassir Zadeh, the individuals below \u2014 stylists, editors, students, writers, designers, and influencers \u2014 agreed to share their style philosophies and influences with photographer Liisa Jokinen. Scroll down to see how their looks came together.\n\nRajni Lucienne Jacques, Fashion Director at Allure and Teen Vogue\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Jonathan Simkhai. Anything and everything inspires my style, especially other black people. My style philosophy: Be easy.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @rajni_jacques\n\nArin Hayes, Co-Director of No Sesso\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI chose to wear this outfit because it represents my brand but is still relaxed and comfortable. My style is inspired by either being super chill and lax or maximalist to the fullest. I don\u2019t follow trends. I just wear what I want to wear.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @nosessola\n\nCharlie Janelle, 28, Writer and Filmmaker\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cThe cashmere sweater is a Calvin Klein, the shorts are Dickies, loafers by Kiko Kostadinov, and the glasses my brother\u2019s. I chose this outfit because I was set on wearing the sweater and needed to let my legs breathe. It\u2019s still summer, after all.\u201d\n\nInstagram:@charliejanelle\n\nTaylor Okata, 33, Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing mostly vintage and CMMN SWDN. I woke up and just felt like wearing something representative of my culture \u2014 I\u2019m from Hawaii. I also just got done styling a campaign that included horses, so I added a paniolo flair.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @taylorokata\n\nShi Stupart, 35, Family Therapist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Forever 21, LF, and Anthropologie. I often wear floral patterns. Today I was inspired by the hot weather and the sun. My style philosophy: Express yourself.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @its.shi.like.shy\n\nReyna Demos, 26, Project Manager at Insidesource\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a 1995 Jean Paul Gaultier \u201cCyber\u201d collection top, Eckhaus Latta pants, $2 thrift store mules, and vintage jewelry. I chose to wear this outfit today because I feel really good in it. My style philosophy: Unfortunately clothing is not always optional, so we might as well dress up and dress expressively.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @reynademos\n\nChloe King, 31, Fashion Office at Bergdorf Goodman\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Jonathan Cohen dress, Maison Margiela pants, The Row bag, and a vintage necklace. I\u2019ve loved this dress since I saw it on the runway in February. Every last detail is heaven. Jonathan is so talented and his pieces always capture his spirit. My style philosophy: Trust your instincts and take chances. You never know what you\u2019ll love until you try it on.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @chloe4dayz\n\nJanka Polliani, 40, Television Host and Influencer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Dries Van Noten set with Bottega Veneta shoes and bag. Casual and perfect for the NYC heat. I get inspired by the people I surround myself with. My style philosophy: Dress up like there is no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @polliani\n\nBrandon Veloria, 33, Co-Founder of James Veloria\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a John Galliano plaid top, Jean Paul Gaultier button up, Miu Miu bag, and Eckhaus Latta jeans and shoes. I had the stomach flu yesterday and wanted to show my midriff. Working in vintage I\u2019m constantly inspired by what comes in. I dress like it\u2019s my first day of school everyday.\u201d\n\nAnnabel Rosendahl, 30, Stylist and Influencer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Chlo\u00e9 top, AGOLDE jeans, Dior bag, and Bottega Veneta shoes. After a very neutral fashion week I felt like wearing colors. I\u2019m inspired by my friends, and by scrolling through Instagram. My style philosophy: Dress for yourself, not everyone else!\u201d\n\nInstagram: @annabelrosendahl\n\nLinda Fargo, SVP of the Fashion Office and Director of Women\u2019s Fashion and Store Presentation for Bergdorf Goodman\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Zimmermann balloon blouse and deconstructed khakis from Phillip Lim. My shoes are an exclusive made for Bergdorf Goodman by Wandler. I walk the line between practical and impractical. Drama and utility. Statement and understatement. I have always been a leopard devotee, especially when it\u2019s paired back to a hit of red, hence the lips! I like to be impulsive and intuitive in my style choices and rarely stick with a plan. Plans are meant to be broken, no?\u201d\n\nInstagram: @lindafargo\n\nCoco Romack, 26, Writer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy jacket and earrings are by Acne Studios, dress by Pleats Please Issey Miyake, boots by Maison Margiela, bag by Simone Rocha. Gallery girls inspire my style. My philosophy: It\u2019s all about the earrings.\u201d\n\nAngela Qehaja, 20, Junior Fashion Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a total denim look by Levi\u2019s, Fendi vintage bag, vintage archive vest, BUFFALO London boots, sunglasses from Groupies Vintage, and a Prada hair pin. When I get dressed, I don\u2019t see myself as a model. I see myself for who I am, and I am happy in the clothes I wear because they express me in every way possible. That\u2019s what pulled me into the fashion universe in the first place.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @angelaqehaja\n\nMadeline Swanson, 28, Accessories Editor at Vogue\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing KkCo silk tie-dye shirt, J. Crew skirt circa 2008, Teva sandals, Trademark bag, Lizzie Fortunato earrings. My family inspires my style! My mom was a stylist and my grandmother made all her own clothes. I love handmade and vintage pieces (especially the ones that came from their closets). Trends change but everything you love or have loved is worth keeping because it will come back! Every day is an opportunity to explore and experiment with an old piece you haven\u2019t worn in awhile.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @madmadder\n\nAlexandra Kennedy, 29, Designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Eckhaus Latta, vintage from Templo, Vivienne Tam, vintage shoes and bag.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @poenaexcess\n\nCelenie Laura Fleur Seidel, 30, Senior Womenswear Editor at Farfetch\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Marc Jacobs shirt, Wales Bonner pants, Rejina Pyo shoes, and The Vampire\u2019s Wife bag. I chose to wear this outfit because I\u2019m really feeling the resurgence of the cargo pant! In terms of fashion inspiration generally, I\u2019m most inspired by combinations of unexpected elements\u2026 when things kind of look a bit weird or off but in a great way. My style philosophy: Embrace newness and change in fashion, just find a way to personalize it and make it fit in your own aesthetic. It\u2019s never worth it if you don\u2019t feel like yourself.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @relrel\n\nNiamh Galea, 24, MFA Candidate and Designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing an Eckhaus Latta peach floral mesh Lapped Baby two-piece from Spring/Summer 2017, Ramp Tramp Tramp Stamp uber-high-waisted underwear, a lingerie dress that I made, and Nike sneakers that I found at Bronte Beach in Sydney one summer night last year. The Tuza bag was a gift from my friend, and so were the hair clips and the knitted belt thing. This is my first Eckhaus Latta show \u2014 I interned for the brand in 2017. My style is inspired by myself, L.A. thots, skater boys, my grandmother, and art mums.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @ramptramptrampstamp\n\nPriyesh Patel, 26, Writer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing suede trousers from a vintage store in London, a top from Weekday, a hat from a vintage store in NYC, bag by Theo Adamson, ring by Georgia Kemball, and shoes by Kiko Kostadinov for Camper. I chose to wear this outfit randomly from a small selection of clothing I\u2019ve brought to New York from London. Also I like the prints clashing together. My style is inspired by clothes. I\u2019ll find random nice things I like in different places and put them together with things I like.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @p_riyesh", "description": "Liisa Jokinen shoots New Yorkers with fearless personal style at her site NYC-Looks.
