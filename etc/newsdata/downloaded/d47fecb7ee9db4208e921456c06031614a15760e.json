If reclassified, Hygeia would become the smallest dwarf planet in the solar system.\n\nAlso on rt.com Dinosaur killing asteroid caused mass extinction by turning oceans ACIDIC\n\nIn order to be a dwarf planet, the object must orbit around the Sun and must not be a moon. It must also be moulded by its own gravity into a round or nearly round shape, and must interact with the smaller objects and debris in its vicinity in a specific way.\n\nThe current leading theory about how Hygeia came to be is that both it and its fellow asteroids are the result of a truly massive head-on collision around two billion years ago.\n\nAccording to this theory, a high velocity projectile measuring between 46 and 93 miles in diameter obliterated whatever the parent object was, creating Hygiea and its roughly 7,000 asteroid belt siblings.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union is set to debate the reclassification in the coming weeks while the world holds its breath.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
