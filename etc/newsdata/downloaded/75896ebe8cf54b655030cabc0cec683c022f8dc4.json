You're really looking at a lot of history and I'm old enough to remember a lot of that history.\n\n'Short form, she was brilliant in the war.'\n\nThe Canadian author was presented with an Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature at Windsor Castle today (pictured, the Queen hands Ms Atwood the award)\n\nEarlier this month, Atwood was jointly awarded the Booker Prize for The Testaments, along with British author Bernardine Evaristo (Atwood is pictured receiving her award from the Queen today)\n\nAtwood, who was awarded the Booker Prize for The Testaments, her sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, earlier this month, said she was 'emotional' as she approached the Queen to receive the honour (she is pictured receiving the award)\n\nAtwood, who was awarded the Booker Prize for The Testaments, her sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, earlier this month (pictured, with the title of her book in the background)\n\nAtwood added: 'When you see the Queen at her age and her schedule that she puts out, it's an inspiration to everybody, you just keep going.'\n\nThe author said she was surprised both by her second Booker Prize win and her ongoing cultural impact.\n\nShe said: 'At my age, it's not the usual thing. Usually at my age you sort of fade away and that doesn't seem to be happening yet.'\n\nAtwood then spoke about the impact of her work worldwide.\n\nThe red handmaids from Atwood's best-known novel, set in the repressive state of Gilead, have been used as a symbol in protests and reproductive rights battles.\n\n'I think that has happened because of the political situations, not just in the United States but because of other countries in the world,' she said.\n\n'Some countries you have seen moving away from Gilead, such as Ireland, and other countries you have seen almost moving away from it, such as Argentina making a big effort to gain equal rights for women.\n\n'Other countries you see moving back towards it, noteworthily several parts of the United States, and these signals being given by the president and his administration are not encouraging.\n\n'In the '90s people weren't as worried but now they are.'\n\nEarlier this month, Atwood was jointly awarded the Booker Prize for The Testaments, along with British author Bernardine Evaristo, who explored the lives of black women in her work Girl, Woman, Other.\n\nAsked about her win, Atwood replied: 'Wasn't that a surprise!'\n\nEarlier this month, Atwood was jointly awarded the Booker Prize for The Testaments, along with British author Bernardine Evaristo, who explored the lives of black women in her work Girl, Woman, Other\n\nMan Booker prize winner Margaret Atwood wore an Extinction Rebellion sticker for the awards night (she is pictured alongside fellow winner Miss Evaristo)\n\nThe decision to split the prize, which was only reached after the judges held a sit-in and refused to name a single winner, led to criticism that Evaristo's novel was given less prominence than Atwood's.\n\nAsked about any difference, Atwood said her book had been well marketed.\n\nBurning tank rescue effort: The two heroic soldiers honoured by the Queen Staff Sergeant Stuart Griffiths and Corporal Saimone Qasenivalu, both of the Royal Tank Regiment, were decorated with the Queen's Gallantry Medal at the ceremony on Friday They were recognised for their bravery after a tank exploded at the Castlemartin training area in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in June 2017 Corporal Darren Neilson, 31, and Corporal Matthew Hatfield, 27, died as a result of their injuries from the blast Warrant Officer Stuart Lawson and Trooper Michael Warren, were injured but survived after the two now-decorated soldiers rushed to rescue them\n\nShe said: 'I think she's getting quite a lot of prominence now. Did we do a good launch of the book? Here in the UK the team was brilliant, they've done a fantastic job.\n\n'We launched the book in London and that was well before the Booker. So, thanks to my publishers one and all, they did that. Myself as a single person would not have been capable, and thanks also to the readers.'\n\nAtwood becomes one of 62 current holders of the Order of the Companions of Honour, which is awarded for achievement in the arts, literature, science and politics.\n\nThe order is limited to 65 people, and the author is the third Canadian on the list.\n\nOther current members of the order include Dame Maggie Smith, former Chancellor George Osborne and naturalist Sir David Attenborough.\n\nA total of 60 people were given honours by the Queen during Friday's ceremony.\n\nLabour MP for Knowsley George Howarth received a knighthood.", "description": "As part of an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle in Berkshire today, the Canadian author was presented with an Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20177582-0-image-a-65_1572004076853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
