Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s tweet came in response to Pelosi\u2019s Wednesday interview with ABC News in which she asserted Schiff \u201cdidn\u2019t make it up\u201d when he performed the fake conversation between the two world leaders during his opening statement at a committee hearing featuring Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nA partial transcript of the exchange is as follows:\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you support chairman Schiff but was it right for him to have that dramatic interpretation of the president\u2019s transcript of the phone call at the hearing last week.\n\nHOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: I want the American people to know what that phone call was about. I want them to hear, it. So, yeah, it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s sad but he was using the president\u2019s own words. So if he\u2019s\u2014.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, those weren\u2019t the president\u2019s words, it was an interpretation of the president\u2019s words. They\u2019re saying he made this up. PELOSI: He didn\u2019t make it up.\n\nDuring the September 26th hearing, the House Intelligence Chairman performed what he claimed was \u201cthe essence\u201d of what President Trump discussed with Zelensky:\n\nWe\u2019ve been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from YOU though. And I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it. On this and on that. I\u2019m gonna put you in touch with people, and not just any people. I\u2019m going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my attorney general Bill Barr. He\u2019s got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I\u2019m gonna put you in touch with Rudy, you\u2019re gonna love him, trust me. You know what I\u2019m asking, so I\u2019m only going to say this a few more times, in a few more ways. And, by the way, don\u2019t call me again. I\u2019ll call you when you\u2019ve done what I asked. This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate.\n\nOf course, words such as \u201cpolitical opponent,\u201d and \u201cmake up dirt,\u201d were absent from the Trump-Zelensky transcript, which, in a nod to transparency, was released last week. Conversely, the actual transcript shows the president encouraged the leader of Ukraine to \u201ccall me more often\u201d and mentioned former Vice President and 2020 White House candidate Joe Biden just once. A partisan CIA officer who filed a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint regarding the pair\u2019s call erroneously alleged that Biden was namedropped eight times. The complaint sparked House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House Wednesday, President Trump slammed Schiff as a \u201clowlife\u201d and demanded that he resign from Congress.\n\n\u201cCongressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of, after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect), fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress, as though mine! He is sick!\u201d he wrote earlier Wednesday.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Thursday floated legal action against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for falsely claiming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA)\u00a0used the president's \u201cown words\u201d when he performed a\u00a0fabricated conversation\u00a0between the president and\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing last week. | Politics", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/afp/25/ae0bc0_us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-was-now-strong-evidence-us-president-donald-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
