So, in the right royal battle for social media supremacy, what does make a winning combination?\n\nInstagram style: Portraits of the couple with shots of their children, many taken by Kate\n\nKATE'S PHOTOS ARE UNIFORMLY GOOD\n\n@kensingtonroyal\n\nNumber of posts: 1,882\n\nFollowers: 10 million\n\nFollowing: William and Kate follow 92 accounts, including other royals, the V&A Museum, No 10 Downing Street and charities such as Prince Harry\u2019s Sentebale and Meghan\u2019s Smart Works.\n\nTheir most-liked pictures involve the children \u2014 and their most popular, with 2.1 million likes, is an image of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in uniform on her first day of school this month\n\nInstagram style: Portraits of the couple with shots of their children, many taken by Kate.\n\nGreatest hits: Their most-liked pictures involve the children \u2014 and their most popular, with 2.1 million likes, is an image of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in uniform on her first day of school this month.\n\nTwo million liked a picture of George\u2019s christening, with 8.3 million views of footage from the day.\n\nThe Cambridges\u2019 Christmas card got 1.8 million likes, but the card from the Sussexes, a photograph of Harry and Meghan watching fireworks after their wedding, got only 839,000.\n\nThe Cambridges shared son Archie\u2019s official christening picture in July and it received 1.2 million likes.\n\nAnother wishing Prince Harry a Happy Birthday pulled in 593,000.\n\nLess popular: Their worst-rated picture was drawings of Paddington Bear back in 2015, which garnered 2,000 likes.\n\nAnd another thing: In February, they lost 150,000 followers overnight after Instagram limited fake accounts.\n\nMEG'S ROYAL SUSSEX STORY\n\n@sussexroyal\n\nNumber of posts: 85\n\nFollowers: 9.4 million\n\nFollowing: Meghan and Harry follow 22 accounts including the Halo trust, Virunga National Park and the African Wildlife foundation.
