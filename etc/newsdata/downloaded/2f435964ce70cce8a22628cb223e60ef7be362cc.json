It hasn't been subpoenaed thus far, it hasn't come to light, and I tell you that if the subpoena is issued for that book that he prepared, it will redound to the detriment of Donald under an agency kind of concept, that Donald will be responsible for all the things that he did. And Giuliani did a lot of the things that he's used to doing while he was a prosecutor.\"\n\n\"Rudy Giuliani prepared this book, you say?\" Melber asked. \"Yes,\" Goldberg replied. \"I've seen the book.\" Melber pointed out that now he has disclosed its existence on national TV, it is likely to be subpoenaed. \"Let the chips fall where they may,\" Goldberg said. \"Giuliani likes to keep a log of the things that he's doing because he wants to show it to the client.\"\n\n\"This is crazy,\" journalist Marcy Wheeler said of Goldberg's revelation. \"In what capacity did he see the book? And why does 'cybersecurity' expert Rudy G have a book of his mob ties?\" There's also a question of whether the likely subpoena will arrive in time.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Jay Goldberg, President Trump's personal lawyer for 15 years, told MSNBC's Ari Melber on Thursday night that he warned Trump not to hire his current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\"I think he's gone off the rails,\" Goldberg said of Giuliani, now being scrutinized by federal prosecutors", "authors": ["Peter Weber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
