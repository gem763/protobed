If hiring weakens any further, unemployment will begin to rise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile job growth continues to soften, there are certain segments of the labor market that remain strong,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, added, noting gains in the healthcare industry.\n\nThe report came hours before a policy announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon.
