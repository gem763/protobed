But they do have some questions about looking after animals, our environmental practices, and how we look after land,' Ms Simson told The Australian.\n\n'We farmers have allowed them to control the space. That is the story that they are putting out there, and we have been remiss in not telling our own stories.'\n\nThe campaign, Telling Our Story, was launched on Monday and aims to promote the farming industry to Australians.\n\nThe NFF is also encouraging teachers to educate students about agriculture.\n\nAs part of Melbourne's Nudie Parade, protesters 'put it all on display' as they stripped down to their underwear and painted climate change messages on their bodies\n\nLast week long disruptions saw a number of protesters arrested by police for their behaviour (pictured: Melbourne Nudie March)\n\nMore than 150 people kneeled in the sand at Manly Beach to stick their heads in the sand\n\nMore than 100 activists placed themselves on the bridge early Friday morning\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters swarmed major Australian cities on Friday.\n\nActivists buried their heads in the sand at Sydney's Manly Beach, while Brisbane's William Jolly Bridge was flooded with marchers.\n\nIn Melbourne, more than 100 activists blocked cars and trams in both directions causing major disruptions.\n\nA large number of activists were arrested.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion activists sent Australian cities into chaos last week leading a series of disruptive protests.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716228-0-image-a-9_1571096077624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
