We appreciate the support from all our traveling Patriot fans. Or maybe they\u2019re from here. I don\u2019t know. It was great to see them.

It was great to have that support, our fans traveling. Maybe we got some converted Redskin fans. But it was awesome.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was debatable whether the level of support Sunday for the Patriots surpassed what some other visiting teams, notably the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles, have generated at FedEx Field in the past. But as the Redskins struggle, visiting fans from the Dallas Cowboys, Chicago Bears and now the Patriots have been heard loudly and clearly in Landover this season. Patriots fans dressed in Brady jerseys could be seen practically everywhere in the parking lots before the game.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome to come in here, even driving in compared to last week going to Buffalo and we weren\u2019t greeted nicely,\u201d safety Devin McCourty said. \u201cComing here today, we saw a lot of Patriots jerseys, a lot of fans in the stadium. So that\u2019s always a plus. You come on the road and you\u2019ve got a lot of fans and a lot of people traveling to support you. We really appreciate that as a team.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, it\u2019s time for Redskins to face a hard reality\n\nRedskins drop to 0-5 after ugly home loss to Patriots, as pressure mounts for Jay Gruden\n\nThree takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to Patriots\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots\n\nNorman Chad: Upon further review, the call stands: Replay stinks\n\nAD", "description": "New England becomes the latest visiting team to feel like it was playing a home game in Landover.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p8b0a_ZrWjCBCjUxsDSzdY6fcbM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PCAFG3XIQUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
