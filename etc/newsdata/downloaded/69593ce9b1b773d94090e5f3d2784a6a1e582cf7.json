The correction failed to retest the 38.2% Fibonacci level and, after a few days of consolidation, printed a bearish pinbar which was also a bearish outside day. Bearish momentum is clearly back with prices back beneath the 2016 low. The bias is for a re-test of 0.6294 and break lower, whist 0.6451 holds as resistance.\n\nNew Zealand Dollar / Japanese Yen,1D\n\n\n\nNZD/JPY is sensitive to risk appetite, although it may have topped without risk-off being required. For example, USD/JPY and AUD/JPY are holding up well (considering yesterday\u2019s explosive move on oil markets) and with NZD/JPY suggesting a swing-high is in place, bears may want to keep an eye on this in case risk appetite sours.\n\nA bearish pinbar failed to see prices close above January\u2019s flash-crash on Thursday, and Friday saw a break beneath its low to warn of a near-term top.\n\nBearish momentum has taken the cross to a 7-session low. With momentum having reverted to its longer-term bearish trend, we\u2019d consider bearish setups whilst the hammer high (or prior support around 36.75) hold as resistance.\n\nBears could use a break of the 20-day eMA/38.2% Fibonacci level to assume bearish continuation, using the 50% and 61.8% levels as interim, bearish targets.\n\nBritish Pound / New zealand Dollar,1D\n\n\n\nGBP/NZD broke out of compression on the back of a stronger British pound on Friday. Over the near-term we\u2019d prefer to see some more consolidation, given that range expansion paused at the upper Keltner band ahead of yesterday\u2019s doji with a slight bearish divergence.\n\nA retracement towards 1.9415 would be a welcome development for traders who like to buy dips. Or traders can refer to lower timeframes to trade continuation patterns for smaller moves.\n\nThe spike high near 1.6979 could provide interim resistance, but if prices trade above here the target becomes the high around 2.000.\n\nNew Zealand Dollar / Canadian Dollar,1D\n\n\n\nNZD/CAD's short swing-trade idea finally appears to be playing out. A bearish wedge has formed during a strong downtrend, and the retracement respected 0.8500 resistance before rolling over yesterday. The underlying analysis remains unchanged; bearish below 0.8500 with potential to target (or even break below) the 2018 low.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
