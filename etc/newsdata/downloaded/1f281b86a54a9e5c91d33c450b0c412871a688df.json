She said her daughter was later found states away. No one was arrested in her daughter's case, which is still under investigation.\n\nNow Deloach works to help law enforcement and comfort families of missing persons.\n\nDeloach said she learned from her daughter's case that often when kidnappers see the law enforcement and media presence intensifying, \"they panic.\"\n\nThat's why at a Monday night vigil for Kamille, Deloach said she appealed directly with the unknown people who took the little girl, pleading, \"She might not even remember who you are, so if you have any heart, please let her go.\"\n\n\"If they don't want to deal with the officers, they can call my number,\" Deloach told ABC News. \"We're begging.\"\n\n\"I don't want a bad outcome from all of this,\" Deloach said. \"I pray no one hurts this baby.\"\n\nPlease keep sharing her picture. 3-year-old Kamille McKinney is still missing.
