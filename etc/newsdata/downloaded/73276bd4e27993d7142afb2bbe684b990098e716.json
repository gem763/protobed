Macquarie, employing about 700 people in cash equities, is expected to cut 100 jobs in London and New York, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMacquarie would have smaller teams in those locations to support its core Asia Pacific businesses, the person said.\n\nAt least four trading sources at other brokerages said their contacts at Macquarie's equities research and trading businesses could not be reached on their usual messaging systems.\n\n\u201cLots of staff are milling around the local coffee shops ... opposite their building [in the City of London] waiting to be allowed in,\u201d one said.\n\nMacquarie is among branches cutting down equity operations \u2013 including trading, sales and research \u2013 in Europe over the past year as difficult market conditions and the impact of tougher regulations hit returns.\n\nAmrit Shahani, research director at industry consultant Coalition, said it had been \u201cvery challenging for Japanese, Canadian, Australian banks et cetera in European cash equities, even top 12 banks have struggled\u201d.\n\nIn April, Japan's Nomura Holdings cut some jobs in its European trading business.\n\nA broader slowdown in equities trading has also prompted banks to cut costs. In July, Deutsche Bank's massive cull of 18,000 jobs in a 7.4 billion euro ($A12.0 billion) shake-up included staff reductions from Sydney to New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblems were evident in Macquarie's August investor update that noted cash equities \u201ccontinued to be impacted by challenging market conditions\u201d.\n\nBut the sector was looking more optimistic in 2009, when Macquarie, then under chief executive Nicholas Moore, flagged development of \u201cgreenfield\u201d cash equities businesses in the US and Europe were proceeding ahead of schedule.\n\nEven in October last year, the company was announcing the hiring of senior staff to its US division as it looked to boost its Wall St profile.\n\nThe restructuring also means Macquarie will enter a preliminary \u201cco- operation\u201d deal with French broker Kepler Cheuvreux to provide reciprocal access for clients in equity trading and research across Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\nMacquarie is also seeking strategic partners in the Americas for client offerings.", "description": "About 100 jobs are expected to go as Macquarie focuses on Asia Pacific.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5504%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_19%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/83d5fc81a6df44f122b1fbb8a122b48ba3ff6a73", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
