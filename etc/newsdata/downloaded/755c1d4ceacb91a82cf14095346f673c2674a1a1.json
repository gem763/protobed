Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nBen: Pete Buttigieg has long been quite strong in Iowa polling, and a new survey out today continues that trend \u2014 according to USA Today\u2013Suffolk, he\u2019s within striking distance of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with 13 percent, five points from Biden\u2019s lead, though 29 percent of caucusgoers say they\u2019re undecided. With the likelihood that he\u2019ll do well \u2014 maybe very well \u2014 in Iowa growing, but with his lack of traction among black voters showing few signs of improving, does he have a legitimate path to winning the Democratic nomination?\n\nEd: Yeah, though it\u2019s a narrow one with a lot of factors beyond his control.\n\nSarah: I\u2019m not willing to discount him completely, but while it\u2019s possible that he has a path, realistically it\u2019s a difficult one.\n\nEd: The path I discern involves Biden beginning to struggle (which we\u2019ve all been waiting for throughout the invisible primary season) at the same time Buttigieg is killing off all those other Biden-alternative candidacies in Iowa. The latter looks entirely possible; not sure Beto, Booker, Harris, or Klobuchar are going to get out of Iowa alive. If Biden really declines quickly, you could have a weird Buttigieg-Warren-Sanders fight pretty early, and none of them exactly has a corner on minority voters (though Bernie\u2019s doing better this year than he did early on in 2016). I\u2019d put my money on Warren in that scenario, but Pete would have a chance.\n\nBen: Buttigieg is clearly trying to position himself as the moderate alternative to Biden, as Ed said. At the last debate, he was aggressive in his criticism of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s fuzziness on how to pay for Medicare for All. In the process, he seems to have turned off some progressives, who were already suspicious of him. A report today that Mark Zuckerberg gave him recommendations on political hires has only furthered the impression on the left that he can\u2019t be trusted to tackle the issues they care about. Buttigieg seems to be betting that he does not need this bloc of voters in his corner \u2014 is that a good bet from a political standpoint?\n\nSarah: He needs them to win the primary, at least, so no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good bet. I also think it\u2019s important to understand exactly why left voters object to his closeness with Zuckerberg \u2014 it\u2019s not all due to their belief that Facebook is a monopoly that should be broken up. It\u2019s business as usual. People who wouldn\u2019t call themselves socialists or even liberals are tired of it. Buttigieg is close to CEOs right when public opinion seems to have shifted firmly against corporate America and in favor of policies like a wealth tax, which target executives like Zuckerberg. It\u2019s potentially a weakness for him with the very working-class voters he says the Democratic Party needs to recruit.\n\nEd: Yeah, I don\u2019t really understand why Pete would want to associate himself with Zuckerberg, and if I were him, I\u2019d try to be the Non-Corporate Moderate in the race. He can raise money without relying on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. I\u2019ve even been willing to argue that to some extent Buttigieg might be able to pull off a sort of centrism-plus-identity appeal like the last two Democratic presidential nominees, though obviously, there aren\u2019t as many LGBTQ Democratic primary voters as there are feminists or African-Americans. But this is a bad moment to be Mr. Wall Street.\n\nBen: One thing that has distinguished his candidacy, though \u2014 especially considering what a long shot he was at the start \u2014 is how much money he\u2019s brought in. He\u2019s got an impressive campaign war chest, with a lot of money coming from small donors, but a lot also coming from the kind of corporate interests Warren and Bernie Sanders have shunned. The cash has allowed him to mount a major campaign apparatus in Iowa, including running TV ads, and it seems to be making a mark. Do voters who like his articulateness and what they see as pragmatism care so much about this aspect of the campaign that shutting off the spigot to Silicon Valley and Wall Street would be worth it?\n\nSarah: Maybe not in Iowa, but elsewhere, maybe? I think we put too much stock in Iowa, generally.\n\nBen: It is true that there\u2019s quite a history of people winning it, then not going on to sustain the momentum.\n\nSarah: All I\u2019d say is that Clinton\u2019s own identity-plus-centrism appeal to voters did not work out well for her in the general, and I think it\u2019s fair to blame that failure in part on the public\u2019s perception of her as a moneyed elitist.\n\nEd: You may be right, but we will all argue until the end of time about which of Clinton\u2019s problems was most important. And look, I am about as credentialed a career centrist as anyone you will meet, but while I don\u2019t think it has any general-election magic associated with it any more, you can make a good case that Democratic primary voters still feel that way.\n\nAs for Iowa, as I noted earlier, its influence depends on who does and doesn\u2019t survive it. It very nearly knocked HRC right out of the 2008 race; if she hadn\u2019t pulled off the N.H. upset five days later, it would have.\n\nBen: One thing we haven\u2019t heard much about Buttigieg is his suitability in a general election. Biden\u2019s perceived strength against Trump is one of his campaign\u2019s central planks, and Sanders and Warren have arguments on their side, too \u2014 that they\u2019ll spur enthusiasm among the young and/or among people who are usually not that politically engaged. Does Buttigieg have a particular electability argument one way or the other? He is very young and also gay, which would be a first for a presidential nominee. Do you have any sense of how those factors would play out if he were to win?\n\nSarah: It\u2019s really hard to say. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s banking on centrism as a way to win over white working-class voters, but again, that didn\u2019t work out for Clinton, and I don\u2019t think it will necessarily work out for anyone else.\n\nEd: I certainly don\u2019t have the imagination to quite envision a general-election contest between someone as articulate as Buttigieg and the troglodyte in the White House. I do worry that despite all the \u201cTrump proves you don\u2019t need a r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d talk, Pete\u2019s tenure as mayor of a small city is a problem, particularly since about all we know of it is his struggle with police-minority relations.\n\nOne small asset Buttigieg has in a general election \u2014 and it could be more important in the primaries \u2014 is that he\u2019s a voice for religiously observant, white mainline Protestants, who, ironically, given their cultural dominance for much of American history, have all but vanished from public discourse in the battle between Evangelicals and the religiously unaffiliated.\n\nSarah: So was Clinton, arguably.\n\nEd: She hardly ever talked about it, though, much like Warren, who has a similar background. Pete does talk about it, a lot. Again, I wouldn\u2019t overestimate this as an asset for Buttigieg, but it\u2019s real.\n\nBen: Given his polling, fundraising, and attention surge, would you still call him a long shot at this point?\n\nSarah: Yeah, I do think that\u2019s fair to say. I think he\u2019s really running to be vice-president at this point.\n\nEd: You know, that was probably true earlier, and may be true again soon enough, but he does have an opening right now if he\u2019s both skillful and very lucky. The key variable remains Biden. A lot of us fear Uncle Joe won\u2019t fully exhibit the weakness we perceive in him until he\u2019s the nominee.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether Pete Buttigieg\u2019s strategy of positioning himself as the moderate alternative to Joe Biden will pay off in the Democratic primary.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart", "Sarah Jones", "Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/21-Buttigieg.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
