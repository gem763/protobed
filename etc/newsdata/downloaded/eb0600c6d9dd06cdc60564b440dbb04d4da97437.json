The rocket may have been launched from the regime\u2019s new 3,000-ton Gorae-class submarine - though the South Korean military disputes this - which could possess the capacity to launch nuke-tipped missiles undetected while submerged.State media in Pyongyang boasted the test showed the regime had successfully developed a ballistic missile called the Pukguksong-3, capable of \u201ccontaining the outside forces\u2019 threat\u201d to the regime.The test, the 11th weapons launch by the country this year, could be a violation of UN resolutions on the country. Resolution 2397, the most recent of these UNSC resolutions imposing economic sanctions on the North, calls for Pyongyang to \u201csuspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program and in this context re-establish its pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on all missile launches.\u201dIn contrast to its reaction to the 10 other tests, which produced little more than strongly worded condemnations, the UNSC\u2019s consultations today could result in greater punishment for the country perhaps in the form of additional economic sanctions, though such a move could put Washington\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Pyongyang at risk.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
