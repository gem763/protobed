While the new night link would initially only run to the Austrian capital, the state railway could later expand direct night-time services to Brussels, an \u00d6BB spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are working on it,\u201d a spokesperson for \u00d6BB said Saturday.\n\nExpansion could see direct links to Berlin, Hamburg and Zurich. A Dutch connection should also be in place in 2021, Matth\u00e4 said.\n\nThe Dutch government has backed plans to reintegrate night trains into its national timetable in an effort to persuade passengers to switch from polluting flights.", "description": "Vienna link will add Belgium to Europe\u2019s growing night train network.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1128285034-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
