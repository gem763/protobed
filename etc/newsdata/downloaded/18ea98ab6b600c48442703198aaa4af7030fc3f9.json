Hopefully, you\u2019ve been maintaining a good credit score, which means the odds are in your favour.\n\nHowever, if you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s also not the end of your home-buying journey, you\u2019ll just have to put that dream house on hold for a bit.\n\nWhat is a credit score?\n\nAll credit active South Africans have a credit profile. This is a summary of your history with every credit provider you\u2019ve ever dealt with, and serves as a record of how well you\u2019ve managed your credit accounts.\n\n\n\nCredit bureaus summarise your credit profile into something called a credit score. A high credit score means you have good credit capacity. Lenders like SA Home Loans look at your credit profile and credit score to find out about your previous credit behavior and assess if you are able to take on a new loan. This information reassures lenders that you\u2019re good at paying money back to those you\u2019ve borrowed from \u2013 i.e. you are a \u2018low risk\u2019 client.\n\n\n\nA good credit score not only makes you more likely to get approval on your home loan application \u2013 but it also means you\u2019ll qualify for a better interest rate. If you have a poor credit score, you will be less likely to qualify for any new loans. This protects clients with low credit scores from taking out additional loans and from overextending themselves and getting into more debt.\n\n\n\nIn short, you\u2019ll need to have a good credit score rating for your home loan application to be approved. It\u2019s therefore a good idea to first find out what your credit score is before applying for a loan, and to give yourself time to improve it before approaching a lender.\n\n\n\nHow to check your credit score\n\nWatch the short video below to find out more.
