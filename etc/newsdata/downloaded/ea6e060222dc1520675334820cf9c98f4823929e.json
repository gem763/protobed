Steve, who was a prison officer, had recently moved to the education department to expand his career. \u201cBack then nobody wanted to work in that area but I was keen to spend more time doing one-on-one work with prisoners. I was ready for something new.\u201d They met for the first time while Helen was teaching a class in the prison\u2019s library. \u201cAnd I always joke that he is long overdue to go back,\u201d says Helen. Although they both liked each other, Steve was reluctant to make the first move. \u201cI was a prison officer and she was a civilian, so I was worried it would have looked inappropriate.\u201d\n\nIn September that year, Helen left the prison to start a new teaching job. On her last day, she wrote a note to Steve and originally gave it to a colleague to pass on. In the end she plucked up the courage to give him the letter directly, to let him know she was interested. \u201cI had an idea what it might be. It was either going to be her phone number or a note to say get lost, you\u2019ve got no chance,\u201d he says. The pair began dating the following month, pursuing their shared interests of art, opera and musicals. When they met, they had a few concerns about the 13-year age gap, although Helen says it has become much less significant over time. \u201cSteve was 29 when we started going out, and a few people raised eyebrows. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for us though. Age is just a number.\u201d\n\nWhile Steve admired Helen\u2019s intelligence and education, she was drawn in by his fun nature. \u201cI thought he had such a serious look about him, but underneath there is a very silly side. He just couldn\u2019t show it at work.\u201d At the time Helen was working as a teacher and a singer.\n\nThey married in July 2008 during a silent Quaker meeting. \u201cThe vows, or promises as we call them, are spoken but the rest of the meeting takes place in silence,\u201d explains Helen. \u201cRather than having an officiant, we marry ourselves in front of witnesses at the meeting. Some people can then stand up afterwards and speak with messages for you.\u201d After the meeting the couple celebrated with a reception for friends and family.\n\nNot long after they were married, Helen\u2019s father became unwell. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2016 we lost three of our parents which was really hard,\u201d she says. They battled through bereavement together \u2013 Helen\u2019s parents and Steve\u2019s dad died in that time frame \u2013 and it brought them closer. Since then they have developed a passion for travel and visited many countries. \u201cWe have been all over the world, to Africa, Nepal, India, China, Australia and Brazil. I love that Steve is always up for anything and always enthusiastic. We do crazy things and change our plans at the last minute just because we can,\u201d says Helen. That \u201ccan do\u201d attitude is also something Steve loves about his wife. \u201cI remember once we went white-water rafting after a difficult six-hour trek. Helen was absolutely terrified, but she still got in the boat and did it. She never gives up. It\u2019s one of the things I most admire about her,\u201d he says.\n\nThe couple attribute the success of their relationship to a close friendship and a taste for new adventures. \u201cI was an opera singer until I was 37, then a teacher and now I do some writing and composing. We are always reinventing ourselves and trying new things,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to be able to do things together,\u201d says Steve. \u201cI think chemistry is superficial. When you really love someone you choose to invest that time in them.\u201d\n\nWhile the pair admit they have taken an unconventional path compared with other couples, they believe it has helped them to build a stronger bond. \u201cWe are never stagnant and we never say still,\u201d says Helen. \u201cWe have shared dreams and goals and I think that is really important for keeping a relationship alive.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
