Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.\n\nIraq denied Sunday that its territory was used for an attack on the Kingdom and U.S. officials said a strike from there would be a violation of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe U.S. officials said additional devices, which apparently didn\u2019t reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and American intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a round-about path, but did not explicitly rule it out.\n\nThe attacks and recriminations are increasing already heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after a prominent U.S. senator suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.\n\n\u201cBecause of the tension and sensitive situation, our region is like a powder keg,\u201d said Iranian Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. \u201cWhen these contacts come too close, when forces come into contact with one another, it is possible a conflict happens because of a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nActions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that\u2019s been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that America blames on Tehran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone.\n\nThe attack Saturday on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom\u2019s crude oil production per day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply. It remained unclear how King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will respond to an attack targeting the heart of the Saudi oil industry.\n\nCrude oil futures shot up 9.5% to $60 as trading opened Sunday evening in New York, a dramatic increase. A spike in oil prices could have negative effects for the global economy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trump says U.S. has reason to believe it knows who was behind attack on Saudi Arabian energy facilities, is \"locked and loaded\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/Trump_40727.jpg-9df34_c0-0-2267-1321_s1770x1032.jpg?b45f24d208a9d2650ea5e4b2cf8e6a6271a6c49d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
