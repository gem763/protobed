Both were endorsed by the European Commission. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom also signalled his approval of these documents to me today.\"\n\nThe Pound has rallied in relief, with Sterling turning deficits against all the major currencies into sizeable gains. The Pound-to-Euro exchange rate is quoted at 1.1626, the Pound-to-Dollar exchange rate at 1.2928.\n\nSterling rallies on Brexit deal\n\nThe move higher in Sterling means the currency has reversed the losses suffered earlier in the day when after the DUP - Northern Ireland's unionist party that backs the Conservatives in Government - said they could not back a Brexit deal in the form currently being proposed.\n\nIn a written statement, DUP leader Arlene Foster said:\n\n\"We have been involved in ongoing discussions with the Government. As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe details pertaining to Northern Ireland are that it will be part of the UK customs union while also adhering to EU customs standards. This would ensure no border is required on the island of Ireland. Customs checks are carried out between the UK and EU, and rebates for Northern Ireland-Britain goods trade are issued.\n\nIn four years, the Northern Ireland Assembly will decide by simple majority on whether to continue applying EU rules.\n\nHowever, the Government's original plans saw the customs agreement last four years, after which it would require the DUP's consent for the agreement to roll over.\n\nThis was essentially a veto and was what the DUP were after.\n\nAn initial response quoted in the newswires suggests that the DUP's position remains unchanged, they won't be backing the deal.\n\nSterling spikes vs. Dollar\n\nAbove: spikes, but scepticism on a deal passing through parliament should keep the Pound in check\n\nClearly this matters, as Prime Minister Johnson now has to present his deal to a highly partisan and fractured Parliament where any majority for a Brexit deal will come down to a handful of votes.\n\nIt is hard to see it pass without the support of the DUP, and we await updated reactions from the Northern Irish party.\n\n\"All eyes now will be on the detail and whether it has the legs to get through UK lawmakers. If so we expect to see the pound push another leg higher and target 1.35 against the dollar in the near term. If it fails, like snakes and ladders it will be a sharp move lower,\" says Phil McHugh, Chief Market Analyst at Currencies Direct.\n\nReaders should therefore not be surprised if the Pound does a sharp reversal lower over coming days.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been here before,\" says John Goldie, FX Dealer at Argentex Group plc. \"Boris has achieved what May couldn\u2019t in getting the EU to amend the text of the agreement, but May\u2019s team had achieved a deal herself previously. The issue was it couldn\u2019t get through Parliament. On multiple occasions. The DUP statement said this morning that they would not support the deal and fresh after Juncker confirmed \u201cwhere there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a deal\u201d the DUP reconfirmed that their position was unchanged.\"\n\n\"Either Boris believes that he can convince them, or that he can do it without them \u2013 on either point I am yet to be convinced,\" adds Goldie.\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Gary Howes covering: GBP/USD, EUR/GBP.
