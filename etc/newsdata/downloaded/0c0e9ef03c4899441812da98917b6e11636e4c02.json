The Washington Post, citing Democrats and congressional aides, said Pelosi has instructed House committees to file the results of their individual investigations within weeks.\n\nThe complaint by an unnamed whistleblower was released on Thursday. The whistleblower alleged that Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to US national security\u201d. According to the complaint the White House intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nTrump was in typically combative form on Friday, continuing to criticize the media and defend his discussion with Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cI had a simple and very nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn\u2019t bad, it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe complaint was released as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee. Maguire said he had initially been blocked by the White House from releasing the complaint to Congress.\n\nIn his opening remarks on Thursday Maguire said the situation was \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d, later saying the whistleblower had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d.\n\nThe complaint details how the Trump administration sought to block access to the transcript of the call with Zelenskiy \u2013 in which Trump asked the Ukraine president to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and offered help in investigating Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential rival.\n\nA number of different House committees \u2013 led by Democrats \u2013 were already investigating Trump for impeachable actions. A main focus of the investigation had previously been whether Trump obstructed justice, as Robert Mueller laid out in his report into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAt a private event in New York on Thursday, the president lashed out at those who helped to inform the whistleblower and alluded to retaliation.\n\nIn audio obtained and released by the Los Angeles Times, Trump says: \u201cWho\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nPelosi, in a press conference in Washington, had denounced the White House for allegedly trying to keep details of the Ukraine call from becoming public. \u201cThis is a cover-up,\u201d she said.", "description": "House speaker wants committees, which were already investigating numerous lines of inquiry, to report within weeks", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bda5546174cb285668c9c14ea63cb370e7fc5bc/0_272_5560_3337/master/5560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6615a6f4487e114eff40e2543e56071", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
