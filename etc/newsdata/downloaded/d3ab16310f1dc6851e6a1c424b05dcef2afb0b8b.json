Stirring berries into clouds of soft, palest yellow apple is among the best of the season\u2019s kitchen rituals. It\u2019s an autumnal pairing that brings with it memories of country lanes and orchards, of bramble scratches and shinning up fruit trees. It is old china bowls of warm crumble and deep slices of purple pie. I have yet to meet two ingredients that sit so perfectly together.\n\nI have yet to meet two ingredients that sit so perfectly together\n\nI don\u2019t think it matters whether the apples are Bramleys or Golden Delicious, Worcesters or Brigadier. The blackberries could be wild or cultivated or from the freezer. But I\u2019m not sure we should mess much with this particular partnership. A couple of cloves and a shake of cinnamon aside, this is not a lily that needs gilding, but it does deserve a more imaginative outing than to be covered by a pastry crust. It works especially well in savoury recipes \u2013 few things flatter a roast loin of pork so well. The sharp fruit pur\u00e9e is a good friend to the layers of quivering fat and crisp skin of the meat.\n\nWhich brings me neatly to crackling and the joy of dipping jagged shards of the stuff, bronze and crisp, into a puddle of violet-streaked stewed apple and blackberry. It is something to cook from scratch or to do with the leftover roast, the golden carapace torn from the meat and sprinkled with salt. That dish of stewed fruit can also become a layer in a trifle, when the juices trickle down into the sponge cake beneath and mingle with walnut-hued sherry.\n\nPork crackling with blackberry and apple\n\nSealed, the pickled blackberries will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks.\n\nServes 4\n\npork skin and fat from the belly 1.25kg\n\nsea salt\n\ncooking apples 1 kg\n\ncaster sugar 1 tbsp\n\n\n\nFor the pickled blackberries:\n\nred wine vinegar 150ml\n\nsoft brown sugar 75g\n\nyellow mustard seeds 1 tsp\n\nsea salt \u00bd tsp\n\nblackberries 250g\n\nTo make the pork crackling, score the skin, using a very sharp cook\u2019s knife or box cutter, in long lines, 1-2 cm apart. Lay the skin on a wire cooling rack, rub generously with sea salt, pushing the grains right down into the score lines, then leave in a cool place for a minimum of 4 hours. Overnight will not hurt.\n\nTo pickle the berries, put the red wine vinegar and soft brown sugar in a medium-sized stainless steel or enamelled pan and bring to the boil. Add the mustard seeds and sea salt. When the sugar has dissolved, cut each blackberry in half then add to the hot vinegar and sugar. Transfer fruit and liquor to a sterilised jar and seal.\n\nSet the oven at 230C/gas mark 8. Place the pork, skin side up and still on its rack, in a roasting tin, then roast for 20 minutes. Turn the heat down to 180C/gas mark 4 and leave for a further 20-30 minutes or until puffed, blistered and crisp. Remove and leave to cool.\n\nPeel the apples, quarter them and remove their cores then put them in a medium-sized saucepan with the caster sugar and 100ml of water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat, cover with a lid, and leave at a light simmer for about 15 minutes until the apples have collapsed into a fluff. An occasional stir will stop them sticking. Transfer to a serving bowl. Crush the apples with a fork or vegetable masher.\n\nBreak the crackling into small pieces and serve with the apple pur\u00e9e. Just before serving, stir some of the blackberries into the apple.\n\nBlackberry and apple trifle\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Not to be trifled with: blackberry and apple trifle.

Pour the cream into a saucepan then add the cinnamon, cloves and a fine grating of nutmeg. Place over a low heat and leave until hot, but do not allow to boil. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside to infuse.\n\nBeat the yolks and sugar until thick and pale then pour in the spiced cream, holding back the cinnamon and cloves with a draining spoon and discard. Wash the saucepan and return to the heat, pouring in the cream mixture. Warm gently, stirring almost continuously, until the mixture has thickened. Transfer to a bowl using a rubber spatula then set aside to cool before refrigerating for an hour.\n\nPeel, core and roughly chop the apples, then put them in a saucepan with the lemon juice and sugar and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, add the blackberries and leave to cook for about 10 minutes until soft and fluffy, then set aside to cool.\n\nBreak the cake into small pieces then place in the bottom of 4 individual dishes or large glasses. Spoon the sherry over the cake and leave to soak in. Divide the apple and blackberry mixture between the dishes, smoothing it over the sponge.\n\nWhip the cream until thick then fold into the cold custard and spoon over the blackberry and apple. Chill in the fridge for an hour or longer, then scatter over a few blackberries and serve.\n\nFollow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater", "description": "Two twists on a classic combination, one with pork crackling, one in a trifle.
