But it had only applied in Europe.\n\nIn 2015, France's data-protection agency CNIL ordered Google to remove global search result listings of pages containing damaging or false information about a person. Google resisted and the two parties have since been wrapped up in a messy battle ever since.\n\nRead more: Google is fighting a big, messy battle over whether expanding the 'right to be forgotten' amounts to censorship\n\nWhile supporters of privacy rights say that \"right to be forgotten\" is an important tool to protect people online, Google argued that expanding this globally would impinge on freedom of speech.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Court of Justice sided with Google.\n\nPeter Fleischer, senior privacy counsel at Google said: \"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy.\n\n\"It's good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments, and we're grateful to the independent human rights organisations, media associations and many others around the world who also presented their views to the Court.\"\n\nActivists heralded the ruling as a victory for free speech.\n\nThomas Hughes, executive director for campaign group Article 19, said in a statement: \"This ruling is a victory for global freedom of expression. Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see.\n\n\"The Court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed - and also to recognise that this balance may vary around the world. It is not right that one country's data protection authorities can impose their interpretation on Internet users around the world.\"", "description": "Europe's top court ruled on Tuesday that Google does not have to apply the 'right to be forgotten' policy globally.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7842/707e8c6275f0410bb79d62d8599e3c80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
