The AI-powered platform digitizes the pictures and suggests solutions to imminent problems on site.\n\nThe U.S. construction industry has lagged behind other industries for decades. Between 1947 and 2010, agriculture achieved cumulative real growth in its productivity of 1,510% and manufacturing 760%. Construction managed only 6%.\n\nRead: Caterpillar stock is slumping because its earnings report was ugly\n\nIt is the same story in the U.K. where the construction industry has also fallen behind other industries when it comes to productivity, and most Brits have an anecdote about building project delays. Over the past two decades, productivity in the sector has grown an average 0.4% a year according to the Office for National Statistics, and only grown 14.8% in three decades.\n\nNeufeld, whose father started his own business in Germany helping people build their own homes, said: \u201cWe [the construction sector] are frequently contrasted with industries, such as manufacturing, where productivity has accelerated.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe most valuable asset that any company has is its people, and we want to free up those people to focus on more creative and strategic endeavors and equip them with the right solutions to rethink how construction is managed.\u201d", "description": "The days of construction projects running behind schedule and over budget could soon be over as AI technology tries to solve the U.S. productivity puzzle.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT936_Constr_ZG_20191024110600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
