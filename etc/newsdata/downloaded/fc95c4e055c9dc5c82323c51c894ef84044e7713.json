But \u2026 it is another of his big lies. It doesn\u2019t matter what image he wants to project. What matters are his actions - which the world whole is seeing.\u201d\n\nGuajajara hails from the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o but is in New York as part of efforts to build an international alliance to counter Bolsonaro\u2019s threat to Brazil\u2019s forests and indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cBrazil is going through one of the worst moment in its history since the return of democracy and it is the responsibility of all of us to try and reverse these attacks,\u201d Guajajara said.\n\nOn the podium this morning Bolsonaro is expected to paint himself as an ally of the Amazon.\n\nGuajajara begs to differ: \u201cThe truth is that this is a dismantling of the future, of all our of our futures. When you permit deforestation, you permit mining and you deny people the right to their territories then you are denying all of us the right to existence.\u201d", "description": "Brazil\u2019s president attacks socialism in Latin America and says freedom only possible with a free market \u2013 follow the latest live", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch", "Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff74da09ec9903957c579a4838ef2b0ed990b6ee/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0e4fd3bbbda7efc1b8044a0d0655fb5", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
