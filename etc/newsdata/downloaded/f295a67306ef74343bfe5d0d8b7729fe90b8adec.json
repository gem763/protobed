With the help of French architect Rudy Ricciotti, their exhibition lets visitors wander among digital versions of his paintings, projected on asymmetrical origami-style blocks.\n\nRicciotti's asymmetrical 3D shapes \"decompose\" the paitings, allowing them to be seen differently, said the exhibition's curator Androula Michael.\n\n\"I saw details that I have never noticed before,\" she said.\n\nMore than 200 versions of Picasso works are included in this new exhibition, which opened its doors to the public on Thursday at Lyon's exhibition space, La Sucriere.\n\nCristina Abellan-Matamoros\n\nMauger said she was looking to break free from the traditional conventions of displaying art and explore a different way of looking at a Picasso.\n\n\"Picasso, when he was asked how his paintings should be displayed, he would say 'badly, we have to display them badly.'\"\n\nMauger said that the modules \u2014 the 3D shapes created by Ricciotti on which the artworks are projected \u2014 allowed her to \"avoid all gravity\".\n\n\"In the exhibition, some artworks are displayed in a crooked way because they have to adapt to the modules.\"\n\nFor Ricciotti, who received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 2004, the installation creates an entry into \"the artist's cubist discourse and make (his art) more accessible to a wider audience.\"\n\nCubism, a 20th-century avant-garde art movement pioneered by Picasso and Georges Braque, is characterised by the use of geometric shapes in paintings.\n\nA poetic voyage through Picasso's work\n\nOlivier Widmaier Picasso, Picasso's grandson, described the exhibition as a \"revelation\" because it allowed him to \"re-discover\" the artworks of his grandfather and see the \"sense of detail and how productive he was\".\n\nWidmaier Picasso was moved by a portrait of his mother and Picasso's daughter Maya holding a doll as a child.\n\n\"I would also say there is a lot of poetry because you have the freedom to go where you want in this exhibition, you don't have to follow the rules, much like Pablo was not following the rules.\"\n\nHis grandfather's open-mind would have allowed him to embrace the \"digital creation\" and \"get the power of it as he did over a century ago when he was discovering photography,\" he said.", "description": "\"A poetic, plastic, generous, voyage where visitors take pleasure in seeing the works through a new lens\" is how the installation creators described the new exhibit.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/92/38/1000x563_cmsv2_b73c3959-ad27-505b-b345-23fbe9b61e21-4239238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
