The 5-year-old infected was from Sudbury, officials said.\n\nThe risk level in Berlin, Boylston, Hudson, Maynard, Stow, and Wayland was raised to high.\n\nA total of 36 communities in the state are now at critical risk, 42 at high risk and 115 at moderate risk for EEE, according to officials.\n\nDr. Monica Bharel, the public health commissioner, said it\u2019s not unusual to see human EEE cases in September.\n\n\u201cThis is why we continue to urge the public to take seriously the threat that mosquitoes can pose and to take steps to avoid being bitten,\u201d Bharel said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health\n\nHealth officials urged residents in Massachusetts to use mosquito repellent. Those in high and critical risk communities should consider staying indoors during the dusk to dawn hours to reduce their chance of being exposed to the bugs.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources conducted aerial spraying for mosquitoes in some counties last month to help reduce the risk. The spraying has since been stopped because evening temperatures are too low to allow for effective aerial application, officials said.\n\nEEE has been found in 400 mosquito samples this year, many of which are species that are capable of spreading the disease to humans.\n\nThe most recent outbreak in Massachusetts occurred from 2004 to 2006 and 2010 to 2012, with 22 human cases of EEE during both time periods.", "description": "Two new cases of EEE have been detected in Massachusetts.
