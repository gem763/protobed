This has been the biggest one-time disruption in oil supply in the history, which has resulted in the largest single jump in prices in record.\n\nAs the dust settles, oil markets consolidate gains near 10% in the session, with the possibility of a deeper downside correction as Saudi said it could restore the half of production by Monday, and Donald Trump allowed the U.S. to tap into the country\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a buffer.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese industrial production growth slowed to 4.4% y-o-y in August, versus 5.2% expected by analysts. Retail sales weakened to 7.5% over the same period versus 7.9% expected by analysts and 7.6% printed a month earlier. Slower production and sales data in China kept the worries of a weaker global demand on the table, despite the short-term supply shortages in oil markets.\n\nBack to the supply side, the Saudi incident increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as the U.S. accused Iran of the drone strikes on Aramco. Iran denied it. But regardless of who is responsible for these attacks, the U.S. accusations on Iran can only wash away the hopes for improved diplomatic relations between the two countries following Bolton\u2019s departure last week. Hence, oil prices should settle higher than their pre-attack levels.\n\nOn the other hand, the attacks came at a sensitive time for Aramco. The company could see its IPO valuation pulled lower as it prepares to go public.\n\nThe U.S. traded mixed. Oil currencies outperformed; Canadian (+0.45%) and Norwegian (+0.59%) gained the most against the U.S. dollar.\n\nEnergy stocks rallied 4.15% in Sydney and mining stocks gained 1.73%. But other industries traded in the negative territory. Industrials (-1.50%) led gains on higher energy cost worries.\n\nU.S. and European futures were offered. lost 0.54%, erased 1.10%.\n\n(-0.50%) slid, as well. But Britain\u2019s energy stocks will likely outperform on the back of significantly stronger oil prices and offset a part of the overall weakness.\n\nStocks in Hong Kong (-1.15%) were hit by another weekend of anti-China protests.\n\ngap opened past the $1500 an ounce on the back of a pile of bad news and advanced to $1512 as risk-off capital poured into precious metals. Silver surged 2.70% to $18 an ounce.\n\nGains in Swiss franc remained limited, as lower Eurozone interest rates raised bets that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) could also lower its rates at Thursday\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Although the pricing in Euroswiss futures hinted at the possibility of a 25-basis-point cut in August, the actual prices suggest no change at the SNB\u2019s September meeting.\n\nThe remained flat, but the slid slowly lower from 1.2523 against the U.S. dollar on news that Boris Johnson would defy the Parliament\u2019s no-deal Brexit ban to take the UK out of the EU by the October 31st deadline. But the probability of a no-deal Brexit decreases by the day. Johnson will talk with EU officials today. Pound traders should remain cautious given that Johnson\u2019s temperamental Brexit approach could possibly give a shake to the market. Inability to find an agreement could stretch the Brexit period to 2022 according to Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, a nightmare for both Boris Johnson and the central bank who crave for a minimum of certainty on the European front.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Cable trades near the sensitive 38.2% Fibonacci resistance of 1.25 on March \u2013 September decline. Clearing the 1.25 offers would indicate a mid-term positive trend reversal in sterling and encourage a further rise toward 1.2670 (50% Fibonacci retracement) and 1.2740 (200-day moving average) against the US dollar.\n\nIt is time for the Fed to take control of its destiny\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is the biggest event on this week\u2019s economic agenda. The Fed is somewhat forced to lower its rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday, as the policymakers have their hands tied due to stretched market expectations. No action from the Fed would send the world equities and bonds tumbling.\n\nBut this month\u2019s cut could be accompanied by a less dovish policy statement to cool off the dovish Fed expectations for the coming meetings and give the Fed a broader choice than just cutting the rates further.\n\nThe U.S. yield recovered to 1.90% from 1.43% at the beginning of this month.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by London Capital Group covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, XAU/USD.
