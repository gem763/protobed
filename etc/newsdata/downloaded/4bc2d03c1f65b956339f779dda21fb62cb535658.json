He headed for X-rays at one point while the Seahawks had the ball, but he did not miss a snap.\n\nHe finished 22 of 37 for 249 yards, a touchdown and the three picks, two of which came on tipped passes. He also rushed four times for 35 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Browns led 20-6 before falling behind 25-20, then retook the lead at 28-25. After the Seahawks went back ahead with 3:30 to play, Mayfield's pass was behind Dontrell Hilliard, going off his hands and being intercepted by K.J. Wright.\n\nMayfield leads the league with 11 interceptions this season, his second in the NFL after being drafted first overall in 2018.\n\nThe Browns have a bye in Week 7, giving Mayfield time to get healthy before a visit to New England in Week 8.\n\n\"Baker is a tough individual,\" head coach Freddie Kitchens said. \"He is a tough quarterback mentally and physically. He will be fine.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield said after Sunday's loss to the  Seattle Seahawks that his left hip injury was never going to force him to  leave...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
