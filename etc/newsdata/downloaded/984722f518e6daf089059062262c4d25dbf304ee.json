At its peak, the coworking company commanded a $47 billion valuation and set its sights on a public offering of up to $100 billion.\n\nThe vision was championed by Adam Neumann, a charismatic cofounder and father of five who believed he was building a company his family would run for the next 300 years.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nWhile his board turned a blind eye, Neumann cashed out hundreds of millions of dollars and lived a lavish billionaire lifestyle, flush with tequila shots, nonstop parties, a private plane, and an impressive real-estate portfolio.\n\nWhich might have been fine, if he had also built a strong business.\n\nIn August, WeWork filed to go public. In doing so, it unveiled an unhealthy, overvalued company that owed billions in long-term lease obligations, enriched leaders like Neumann, and irresponsibly blew its war chest. Investors who took a close look were aghast.\n\nWith Neumann at the helm, bankers told WeWork's board the company could never go public. Six weeks later, Neumann's legacy came crashing down. He was forced to step down as CEO, and the company found itself nearly in financial ruin after his departure.\n\nWeWork is the story of what happens when Silicon Valley greed goes haywire and the idea of building a big business becomes more important than the fundamentals.\n\nIt's also the story of a compelling leader, who both hoodwinked investors and was enabled by them, in their quests to drive returns on their investments higher. Thousands of employees are now paying the price.\n\nBusiness Insider has led coverage on the WeWork catastrophe, producing more than 250 stories and original reports over the past few weeks that range from deep investigations to must-read analysis.\n\nNow we are partnering with Campfire, the producer of the hit Netflix show \"The Innocent Man,\" to tell the startling story in a film-length documentary.
