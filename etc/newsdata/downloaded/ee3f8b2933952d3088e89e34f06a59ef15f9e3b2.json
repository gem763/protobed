He said several people were injured.\n\nPolice said in a tweet early Wednesday afternoon that \u201cthe suspected perpetrators\u201d had fled in a car after the attacks and quickly reported that one person had been arrested. Officers spread out in force across Halle, a city of 240,000, urging residents to stay at home.\n\nSeveral hours later, police said there was no longer an \u201cacute\u201d danger to the city and residents could go back into the streets. They gave no details about the person who had been arrested.\n\nPolice also didn\u2019t specify why their assessment had changed, but the news agency dpa and the Bild newspaper cited unidentified security sources as saying the evidence points to a lone assailant.\n\nNews magazine Der Spiegel, which didn\u2019t cite its sources, said the suspect is a 27-year-old man from Saxony-Anhalt state, where Halle is located.\n\nIt also said investigators have a video that the assailant apparently filmed with a camera on his helmet. Rita Katz, the head of the SITE Intelligence Group, wrote on Twitter that 35 minutes of footage of the attacks were posted on a video game site, and that the attacker said in English before the shooting that the \u201croot of all problems are the Jews.\u201d\n\nShe said it showed the attacker shooting a woman in the street after failing to enter the synagogue, then entering a business and killing another person before fleeing.\n\nThe filming of Wednesday\u2019s attack echoed another horrific shooting halfway around the world, when a far-right white supremacist in March killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and livestreamed much of the attack on Facebook. That massacre drew strong criticism of social media giants for not immediately finding and blocking such a violent video.\n\nFederal prosecutors, who in Germany handle cases involving suspected terrorism or national security, took over the investigation into the attack in Halle.\n\nA video clip broadcast by regional public broadcaster MDR showed a man in a helmet and an olive-colored top getting out of a car and firing four shots from behind the vehicle from a long-barreled gun. It wasn\u2019t clear what he was shooting at.\n\nPictures from the scene showed a body lying in the street behind a police cordon, opposite the synagogue, which was about 30 meters (yards), dpa reported.\n\nThe head of Halle\u2019s Jewish community, Max Privorozki, told Der Spiegel that a surveillance camera at the entrance of the synagogue showed a person trying to break into the building while there were 70 or 80 people inside.\n\n\u201cThe assailant shot several times at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers or grenades to force his way in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the door remained closed \u2014 God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nDpa quoted unidentified security sources as saying that an assailant laid home-made explosives outside the synagogue.\n\nA witness interviewed on n-tv television said he had been in a kebab shop when a man with a helmet and a military jacket threw something that looked like a grenade, which bounced off the doorframe. Conrad Roessler said the man then shot into the shop at least once.\n\n\u201cAll the customers next to me ran, of course I did too. I think there were five or six of us in there,\u201d Roessler said. \u201cThe man behind me probably died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hid in the toilet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe others looked for the back entrance. I didn\u2019t know if there was one. I locked myself quietly in this toilet, and wrote to my family that I love them, and waited for something to happen.\u201d\n\nPolice then came into the shop, he said.\n\nSynagogues are often protected by police in Germany. Security was stepped up at synagogues in other cities after the shooting in Halle.\n\nGerman officials rushed to condemn the attack.\n\n\u201cShots being fired at a synagogue on Yom Kippur, the festival of reconciliation, hits us in the heart,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. \u201cWe must all act against anti-Semitism in our country.\u201d\n\nVice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that \u201call our country\u2019s citizens of Jewish faith can be sure that we are with them with our whole heart and we will give them all the security that is possible.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Berlin said \u201ctoday\u2019s attack is an attack on all of us, and the perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nPolice said shots were also fired Wednesday in Landsberg, about 15 kilometers (nearly 10 miles) from Halle but it wasn\u2019t clear whether the two situations were related.\n\nThe European Parliament held a moment of silence at the start of its session Wednesday to mark the unfolding situation in Halle.\n\nManfred Weber, the German leader of the center-right EPP group in the parliament, declared that \u201canti-Semites and anybody who wants to question freedom of belief are not just our opponents, they are our enemies.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMoulson reported from Berlin.\n\n___\n\nAn earlier version of this story was updated to correct the spelling of the Jewish community leader\u2019s surname to Privorozki, not Privorotzki.", "description": "HALLE, Germany (AP) \u2014 A heavily armed assailant tried to force his way into a synagogue Wednesday in eastern Germany on Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/05300f_aptopix-germany-shooting-09252-police-officers-cross-wall-crime-scene-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
