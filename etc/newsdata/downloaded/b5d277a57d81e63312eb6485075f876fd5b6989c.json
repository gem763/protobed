No rifle or bear spray.\n\nVladimir Kostenko planned to stay at a tiny dry cabin for months. He was seeking no less than the meaning of life.\n\nFor most of his 42 years, Kostenko had been on a spiritual quest to understand his place in the universe. An immigrant from Russia living in a small town in Washington state, he had pursued an almost monk-life existence, fasting regularly, meditating for hours and reading widely on religion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just not like anybody I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said his sister, Alla Kostenko.\n\nVladimir had traveled the world looking for his purpose on Earth. The bearded, soft-spoken mechanic had lived in a Russian hippie commune and spent time following a charismatic evangelical preacher in Ukraine.\n\nBut the cabin deep in the Purches Creek valley would prove to be his deepest, riskiest journey yet.\n\nVladimir was born in the town of Zelenokumsk, in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.\n\nHe grew up in a large, conservative Baptist family at a time when Christians were persecuted for their beliefs under the Soviet system, Alla said.\n\nAmong the 13 siblings in the Kostenko family, Vladimir \u201cwas always the quiet one,\u201d said Alla, who lives on a coffee farm in Hawaii. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t initiate anything. We\u2019d be the ones to say, \u2018Let\u2019s go here, let\u2019s play this game.\u2019 He would follow and be quiet.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, the Kostenko family moved to the United States through a program that allowed Christians fleeing religious persecution in Russia to immigrate.\n\nThey settled in the small town of Walla Walla, Washington, a college and wine country town of about 30,000 people in the rural southeast corner of the state.\n\nMoving to the United States \u201cwas a dream for us,\u201d Alla said. \u201cWe were all just amazed.\u201d\n\nBut some family members had an easier time adapting to American life than others. Alla, one of the youngest, was 15. She went quickly learned English at her public high school.\n\nVladimir was 22 and out of school.\n\n\u201cI blended in a lot better,\u201d Alla said. \u201cFor my older siblings, they took some ESL classes, but they still kind of lived and communicated in Russian.\u201d\n\nAs they grew older, Vladimir and some of the younger siblings in the family stopped attending the conservative church they\u2019d been raised in.\n\n\u201cWe all went on a personal search for answers,\u201d Alla said. \u201cFor understanding what spirituality is, what God is, individually.\u201d\n\nNone pursued it quite like Vladimir.\n\nIn 2011, he went to live in a \u201cRussian hippie community\u201d near Moscow to see if he \u201ccould find meaning to the spiritual gifts he was given,\u201d Alla said.\n\nHe returned to Walla Walla, and several years later traveled to Ukraine. There he became interested in the teachings of a controversial charismatic Ukrainian evangelist named Vladimir Muntyan.\n\nVladimir was unusually earnest about his quest to understand the mysteries of God, she said.\n\nHe was also a bit of a loner. As he grew older his family wondered whether he wanted a wife or children.\n\n\u201cHe always said, I\u2019d absolutely love to do that,\u201d Alla said. \u201cBut if I have not figured out what I\u2019m here for and what this is all about, I cannot bring another person into this.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Vladimir had been living quietly on the property of a family friend in Walla Walla, fixing up old cars. He was an uncommonly talented mechanic, Alla said. Money meant little to him and he\u2019d often tell people to pay him \u201cwhatever they wanted to pay.\u201d God would provide, he figured.\n\n\u201cHe was always talking about how he wants to be useful,\u201d Alla said.\n\nSuddenly, an opportunity to come to Alaska arrived.\n\n\u2018Truly in the middle of nowhere\u2019\n\nDmitry Kudryn, a family friend and successful entrepreneur in Wasilla, needed someone to drive a truck full of merchandise from the Lower 48 to Alaska.\n\nKudryn is a charming self-made millionaire and aspiring YouTube star who has dabbled in cellphone repair stores and who now owns Crave, a business that manufactures phone accessories, as well as a construction company.\n\nKudryn is the oldest of 12, from a Ukrainian family that also came to the United States as refugees fleeing both religious and political persecution. The decor of his office, in a new construction building just off the Parks Highway, features a framed copy of the U.S. Constitution and an American flag.\n\nThe Kudryn and Kostenko families crossed paths in Walla Walla before Kudryn moved to Wasilla in 1999. They shared the experience of being large, Russian-speaking immigrant families in a small town in the rural Pacific Northwest, and they\u2019d stayed in touch over the years.\n\nWhile Kudryn had not been particularly close with Vladimir himself, he was happy to welcome him to Alaska.\n\nVladimir knew Kudryn owned a dry cabin in the Purches Creek valley, on the western side of Hatcher Pass near Willow. Getting to the 12-by-20-foot cabin requires a 14-mile hike from Hatcher Pass Road, over mountain passes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Kudryn said. \u201cIt\u2019s so quiet, no phones, nothing.\u201d\n\nPeople mostly use the area for snowmachining in the winter, plus some mining, hunting, trapping and a little hiking in the summer, said Rudy Wittshirk, a longtime Willow resident who has extensively explored the area.\n\nBut it is an especially remote corner of Hatcher Pass where few venture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cliche, so I hate to say it, but that is a pretty rugged area,\u201d Wittshirk said.\n\nKudryn was open to letting his friend use the cabin. But a few things worried him.\n\nFirst, Vladimir only wanted to bring 5 pounds of oatmeal and no other food. Though the cabin was well-stocked with canned foods, Kudryn worried that the already-thin Vladimir - 6\u20181 and 145 pounds - might not have enough to eat. Why not bring a few vegetables, he wondered.\n\nVladimir also wouldn\u2019t take a gun - or even bear spray.\n\n\u201cThat bothered me a little bit, I\u2019ve lived here for 20 years so I kind of know what you probably should and shouldn\u2019t do in the wilderness,\u201d Kudryn said.\n\nBut Vladimir was an adult, Kudryn figured.\n\nAnd he seemed to really want to go to the cabin.\n\nOn Aug. 18, Vladimir took a taxi from Kudryn\u2019s office in Wasilla to Hatcher Pass Road, to set out for the long hike.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t completely cut off: Vladimir carried an iPhone and external power bank with solar recharging function. At first, he stayed in touch by climbing high enough on a peak near the cabin to send text messages and photos.\n\nThe first message Kudryn received showed Vladimir on the hike in, taking a timer self-portrait on the late-August tundra.\n\n\u201cAscended the first mountain,\u201d Vladimir wrote in Russian.\n\nHe sent another: \u201cCrossed the creek.\u201d\n\nPurches Creek threaded the narrow valley, the mountain walls already turning gold and green. The cabin was barely visible, a dot.\n\nIn late August and early September, Kudryn would receive intermittent text messages from the cabin, detailing Vladimir\u2019s travails with a marauding ground squirrel that he eventually killed.\n\nVladimir seemed to love being there.\n\n\u201cThis place is amazing, especially without the squirrel,\u201d he texted.\n\nKudryn asked if he had enough food.\n\n\u201cThere is enough food for three years,\u201d Vladimir replied. \u201cI\u2019m on day six of fasting.\u201d\n\nIn September, some hunter friends stopped at the cabin. They left Vladimir with fresh provisions: olives, apples, honey, smoked salmon and fresh-baked bread and kvass, a Russian fermented drink.\n\nIn text messages, Vladimir spoke of the cranberries and blueberries he was picking. He had boiled some down into jam.\n\n\u201cI have no plans to leave,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOctober came. Then November. No more text messages arrived from Vladimir.\n\nKudryn began to worry about the cold, and Vladimir\u2019s food supply. On Nov. 3, he and his brother, both pilots, decided to fly out to check on him.\n\nKudryn decided to affix cameras to his plane and make a video for his YouTube channel Crave Life, which features Alaska outdoor adventures as well as Kudryn\u2019s life as a traveling businessman.\n\nThe video chronicles Kudryn shopping for and packing Home Depot buckets of carrots and bread for Vladimir. He called it \u201cAlaska Rescue Mission by Air.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who went to a very remote cabin \u2026 on foot \u2026 literally in the middle of nowhere in the mountains,\u201d Kudryn said, narrating the video in YouTuber-style high drama. \u201cI\u2019m really, really concerned for him.\u201d\n\nThe Purches Creek valley was dusted with snow. The brothers flew low enough to see Vladimir emerge from the cabin. His arms are at his hips, standing on the porch. He looks like he\u2019s wearing black sweatpants and a light jacket.\n\nKudryn and his brother dropped the two buckets of food. From the porch, Vladimir gestured at them. He seemed to be saying that he was going to be heading out soon, Kudryn thought.\n\nAfter that, Kudryn traveled to Asia for business. Still no Vladimir. When he got back, a 7.1 earthquake rocked Southcentral Alaska. He heard nothing from the cabin.\n\nWorry mounting, Kudryn and his brother decided to fly out again on Dec. 23. They knew Vladimir had no experience with Alaska winter. There was only six hours of daylight now, the pink low-horizon solstice light barely creeping over the high mountain walls.\n\nIt was cold in Wasilla, in the single digits. It was even more frigid in Hatcher Pass. Kudryn filmed again for another video.\n\nThe valley was frosted in snow, the creek partly iced over. They looked for smoke from the cabin\u2019s wood stove, any sign that Vladimir was inside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s snow on the smokestack,\u201d Kudryn said as they flew over. \u201cThat should be melted, if he was having a fire.\u201d\n\nThe porch was clean. There were tracks all around the house - but it wasn\u2019t clear whether they were from a human or an animal. This time, no one emerged from the cabin. The place looked locked up.\n\nMaybe Vladimir was trying to walk out. They dropped more supply buckets, just in case.\n\nAfterward, Kudryn\u2019s bravado fell away. He seemed shaken.\n\n\u201cMy next phone call is going to be to the Alaska State Troopers,\u201d he said at the end of the video.\n\nA few days later, on Dec. 26, Kudryn decided he needed to go back to the cabin to see for himself if Vladimir was inside.\n\nHe chartered a helicopter, landed and found the cabin had been meticulously sealed shut with a sheet of brown metal nailed over the door.\n\nHe pried the nails off and entered, not knowing what he\u2019d find inside. The cabin was in perfect order: Spices neatly stacked on the shelf. Plenty of firewood, a water container, bunk beds covered in blankets. Canned food. Hunting coats, outdoor gear. Empty buckets. A propane tank.\n\nVladimir left no notes - just a Russian phrase written on a piece of wood. Alla thinks it says something like \u201cfrankincense aroma - do not burn.\u201d Maybe he was using it as the old preachers did, to ward off bad spirits, she said.\n\nThere was no sign of Vladimir.\n\nKudryn tromped through the snow and spotted one of the orange buckets he had dropped by air days earlier. \u201cMERRY CHRISTMAS,\u201d he had written on the side. Now Christmas had come and gone. It sat in the snow untouched.\n\nThe tracks seen from the air on the last flight turned out to be from a moose.\n\nIt seemed Vladimir had made a planned departure. But how long ago? And where was he now?\n\nKudryn asked the helicopter pilot to fly the trail Vladimir would have taken to get back to the Hatcher Pass Road. From the air, it was a thin ribbon of white in a monochrome expanse of winter spruce trees and snow. It twisted and turned. It would be easy to get lost.\n\nKudryn went back once more, this time with two Alaska State Troopers, by snowmachine. Again he filmed the expedition for his YouTube channel.\n\nThey found a trap line and snowmachine trails. They posted MISSING signs on spruce trees. They found no trace of Vladimir.\n\nKostenko was quietly listed as missing by the Alaska State Troopers, his wild-eyed photo added to a grid of more than 100 people who have disappeared in Alaska over decades.\n\nTroopers launched no large-scale organized search for Vladimir.\n\n\u201cIn cases where a person or persons has been reported overdue from, say, a hike, troopers normally have a timeline and direction of travel to follow up on,\u201d said Ken Marsh, a spokesman for the Alaska State Troopers. \u201cScope of the search may depend upon how long the individual has been overdue; what trail, river, or general route of travel that person is likely to have taken; geography of the location, and weather conditions.\u201d\n\nIn Vladimir\u2019s case, weeks had gone by since he\u2019d last been seen, Marsh said. Snow had fallen, obscuring tracks or other clues.\n\nIn short: Searchers had no idea where to look for him, Marsh said.\n\nDashed hopes\n\nThen came a confusing twist.\n\nThe Alaska State Troopers initially told the Kostenko family that a search of airline records showed a person named Vladimir Kostenko flew out of Alaska, and later on to Hawaii, on Dec. 17, according to Alla.\n\nThat seemed a bizarre twist - \u201cstrange and inconsiderate\u201d that her brother might leave the Alaska wilderness without advising anyone of his plans. Even stranger that he would travel to her own state and not try to see her.\n\nBut it was also a kernel of hope that Vladimir was alive somewhere. For months Alla looked at homeless people on the streets of Hawaii and tried to spot her brother among them. She wondered if he would wander up her driveway some morning.\n\n\u201cWe were under the impression that that\u2019s what happened to him so we weren\u2019t looking for him, for half a year,\u201d she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until May that Alla, in another conversation with the troopers, learned that there had been a miscommunication.\n\nNobody named Vladimir Kostenko had flown out of Alaska, they said.\n\nBut in early May, police in Oregon stopped a Vladimir Kostenko boarding a flight at Portland International Airport to see if he was the missing person. He was not.\n\nThe family is now reckoning with the idea that Vladimir never left Alaska and may not have made it out of the valley.\n\nIt has now been nearly a year since Vladimir Kostenko was seen alive. Certainty, even of his death, would be a balm for their grief, Alla said. The hardest thing is not knowing.\n\nWaiting for answers\n\nVladimir\u2019s cellphone last pinged on Dec. 3. Perhaps that\u2019s the day he decided to hike out. There are so many things that could have gone wrong.\n\n\u201cMaybe he was not too strong,\u201d Alla said. \u201cHe was fasting. It was a long hike and a short day and he did not have winter clothing.\u201d\n\nKudryn says he wonders if Vladimir was lulled into a false sense of security by his easy journey to get to the cabin, in the still-full blush of summer.\n\n\u201cNever underestimate nature,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has absolutely no mercy.\u201d\n\nWittshirk, the longtime Willow resident, said an \u201cendless\u201d list of misfortunes could have derailed a 14-mile dead-of-winter hike in limited daylight, especially for someone without much Alaska wilderness travel experience.\n\n\u201cI go out very often into that kind of country - backpack, camp - and you gotta be lucky or know what you\u2019re doing or both,\u201d he said. \u201cYou gotta be really careful, oh my God - there\u2019s a thousand ways you can buy it out there.\u201d\n\nNo one knows what Vladimir went through in his later days at the cabin. Was he happy, lost in a reverie of prayer? Was he scared? Was he weak from fasting? What did the 7.1 earthquake feel like in the valley? Did it seem like a sign from God?\n\nHis sister can only imagine that those months in the Purches Creek valley may have felt like the answer to the questions her brother had devoted his life to.\n\n\u201cIf that was how his life was supposed to end - I think he was deeply peaceful,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sure of that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Kostenko family wants to hear from anyone with information on Vladimir or who has spent time in the Purches Creek area. They\u2019ve set up an email address, [email protected], for people to contact them.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Anchorage Daily News, http://www.adn.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In August 2018, a solitary man walked 14 miles into a lonely valley on the western side of Hatcher Pass.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michelle Theriault Boots"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/exchange_spiritual_quest_missing_84901_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
