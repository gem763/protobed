The piece wasn\u2019t merely a representation of my own views, but pulled in snarky tweets from other journalists disparaging her work too. It was a pile-on, and not my proudest moment.\n\nThe Writer wasn\u2019t exactly thin-skinned; in fact, quite the contrary: She was a brash, sometimes obnoxious feminist with strong opinions, unafraid to speak her mind. I often agreed with her, even when I found her delivery abrasive. Still, after a couple of years with me as a thorn in her side, she decided she\u2019d had enough\u2014and so she did something that many readers will find familiar: She blocked me on Twitter.\n\nThe block button is an important tool that allows women and other vulnerable people to have some semblance of the same Twitter experience that the average white man might, free from constant harassment. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve used it over the years to drown out nasty ad hominems, sea lions, and of course, sexual harassment and worse.\n\nTwitter wasn\u2019t always the \u201chell site\u201d we know it as today. Many early users like me found professional advancement and lasting friendship in 140-character missives. But as the site grew, so did its potential for misuse. By 2014\u2014two years shy of its tenth anniversary\u2014Twitter had become central to the GamerGate controversy, ostensibly a dispute about issues of sexism and progressivism in gaming but on Twitter, a free-for-all of harassment and doxing of any woman even tangentially involved in the discussion. The harassment was so severe that it drove some women off the site permanently.\n\nOut of GamerGate emerged better tools for blocking, tools like BlockTogether that allow individual users to share a list of people they\u2019ve blocked. The idea behind these tools is that harassers are likely to have multiple targets, so why not make it easier for potential targets of harassment to block numerous would-be harassers all at once?\n\nBut BlockTogether and similar tools are not without flaws. Once you\u2019re on a blocklist, it can be hard to get your name removed and if you end up, for whatever reason, on one created by a prominent or well-respected user, you may find yourself blocked by people you don\u2019t know and would\u2019ve enjoyed following. Some might call this reasonable collateral damage.\n\nNumerous journalists and others have complained of finding themselves on a blocklist after a disagreement with an individual who uses them. I\u2019m unfortunately on one used by a number of journalists. Why, you might ask, was I blocked in the first place? I remember quite clearly: It was for disagreeing with someone about the life sentence handed to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road website. For my opinion, I\u2019ve lost the ability to follow or interact with dozens of journalists whose work I read.\n\nDespite that, I don\u2019t blame women or other minorities who\u2019ve experienced harassment for using the block button liberally. Blocking someone isn\u2019t a matter of free speech (unless of course the blocker in question is an elected official), as some of my harassers have claimed\u2014rather, it\u2019s often a matter of preserving one\u2019s sanity. The block button, along with blocklists, are useful tools for curating space\u2014not a safe space per se, but one free from random harassers, spammers, and the like. Think of it more as a large invite-only event, as opposed to a New York City street.\n\nAnd yet, I can\u2019t help but wonder if our liberal use of the block button prevents us from experiencing the kind of reconciliation that can happen in our offline communities. We often remove someone from our life, only for them to apologize their way back in later on. Even the Amish, who practice shunning as a matter of faith, allow for the repented to return.\n\nTwitter\u2019s architecture has changed over time, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. Presently, its algorithm sometimes surfaces replies from people you do follow, to tweets from individuals you don\u2019t, based on some assumption that you mind find them interesting. Occasionally, it will surface a reply from a friend to someone with a locked account or, in rare cases, to someone who blocks you, as it did for me the other day. Someone I follow had replied with an interesting comment to a tweet from The Writer\u2014a tweet that, of course, I couldn\u2019t see without logging out and going directly to her profile. And so I did.\n\nWhat I found was someone who, with that same fierce energy, seemed a lot more thoughtful, with views more similar to mine than I remembered. I felt a momentary pang of sadness for the camaraderie that might have been. I realized the obvious: That we\u2019ve both grown, alongside the backdrop of the horrific political environment that\u2019s accompanied us through the past half-decade. \u201cHave you thought about reaching out to her?\u201d a friend asked.\n\nTherein lies the rub: In the case of The Writer, I could reach out to her; we\u2019ve met in person a few times, and we retain mutual friends. She might respond favorably, or with a \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d, but either way, it\u2019s unlikely she would deem my approach to be harassment. But there\u2019s this other journalist I\u2019ve never interacted with, who no doubt signed up to a blocklist that I happened to be on. I discovered that she blocked me when I went to read a tweet someone had DM\u2019d me, and was disappointed\u2014but reaching out to her through some other channel would seem weird, invasive. It isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nI recently reviewed my own list of blocked accounts (you can do so through your settings), a list that numbers well into the hundreds. Most aren\u2019t worth revisiting\u2014there\u2019s sexual harassers and transphobes, Bahraini bots and Roseanne Barr, some Trumpites and a few high-profile right-wing accounts. But among them, close to the bottom of the list (coinciding with the early days of the block button), I spotted a few outliers, and decided to give them a second chance.\n\nTechnology is constantly changing and progressing and yet, the block button\u2014and blocklists\u2014remain in rudimentary form. They\u2019re simply not priorities for companies whose focus is on profit. But were we to redesign them, perhaps we could find a way to make blocks time-limited, or at least provide users with more nuanced options. One such existing feature is Facebook\u2019s \u201csnooze\u201d button, which allows users to \u201cmute\u201d another person for 30 days, with a reminder when that time period is up; I found that one particularly handy last summer while a friend was going heavy on self-promotion. I use Twitter\u2019s \u201cmute\u201d function to rid my feed of people with whom I have to interact professionally and thus can\u2019t block. And then there\u2019s the \u201csoft block\u201d\u2014a feature or bug, it isn\u2019t clear\u2014wherein one can block and unblock someone quickly on Twitter so that the user no longer follows them\u2026at least until they wisen up (this feature/bug is made easier by the fact that Twitter seems to be perpetually plagued by an \u201cunfollow bug\u201d). These tools are helpful, but with all the riches these companies have, they could design something\u2014with input from those most affected by harassment\u2014that is less blunt, more elegant, more thoughtful.\n\nUltimately, the block button is an imperfect solution to a pervasive problem, and therefore remains as necessary as ever. I know that I\u2019ll continue to use it as long as I\u2019m on social media. But\u2026don\u2019t we deserve something better?", "description": "Jillian C.
