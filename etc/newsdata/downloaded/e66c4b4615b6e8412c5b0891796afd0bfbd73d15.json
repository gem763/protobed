After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away\u2026 Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening, and that, if she ever presents her story to the F.B.I. or members of the Senate, she will inevitably be pressed on her motivation for coming forward after so many years, and questioned about her memory, given her drinking at the party. And yet, after several days of considering the matter carefully, she said, \u201cI\u2019m confident about the pants coming up, and I\u2019m confident about Brett being there.\u201d\n\nRamirez, the alleged victim, is herself unsure of whether she was assaulted by Kavanaugh. Which turns out to be a recurring problem in the media\u2019s Kavanaugh scandal coverage.\n\nThe New York Times introduced the possibility that Ramirez\u2019s story might at long last be corroborated, however, in the Kavanaugh story published over the weekend that\u2019s getting attention today for its already infamous \u201ceditor\u2019s note.\u201d Quote: \u201cAt least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez\u2019s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge. Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time.\u201d Seven different people heard about Kavanaugh assaulting Ramirez before the rest of the world did \u2014 two of them contemporaneously? That\u2019s a big problem for Kavanaugh defenders. Suddenly Ramirez\u2019s shaky memory seems less shaky.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to this claim too, and again that \u201cmore\u201d was strangely omitted from the Times piece. Byron York got hold of a copy of the book written by the authors of the NYT piece that delves into detail about what those seven people did and didn\u2019t know about the incident. I don\u2019t want to quote York at length since he did the work of sifting through it and writing it up. Read his piece for the full treatment. But this should suffice for our purposes:\n\nThat is the seven. Number 1, Ramirez\u2019s mother, based her account on four very unspecific words from her daughter 35 years ago. Number 2, Appold, based his account on a memory of being told something by a \u201cwitness\u201d who could not recall the incident at all. Number 3, Wetstone, heard it from Appold. Number 4, Oh, overheard something from someone he doesn\u2019t remember that did not connect the incident to Kavanaugh. Number 5, Anonymous, is totally unclear. And Number 6 and Number 7, Ludington and Roche, had \u201cvague\u201d memories that also did not connect an unspecified incident to Kavanaugh.\n\nNot one of the seven actually witnessed the assault. Only one, Appold, even heard Kavanaugh\u2019s name mentioned in connection with it, and the person who told him couldn\u2019t recall the incident when contacted by the New Yorker. Tiana Lowe also got hold of the book and sums it up:\n\nTo recap: Of the seven sources meant to bolster the credibility of Ramirez\u2019s allegation, only one recalls hearing Kavanaugh mentioned as the perp by an unknown source who, if he ever existed, has since failed to come forward. Only one other person claims to have independently heard about such an incident at the time, but he does not appeared to have named Kavanaugh in connection with it. Three of the sources may not have recalled any details about the incident, and another one just heard it from the first.\n\nLiterally no one, including the alleged victim, is sure that Kavanaugh did anything. This is what\u2019s supporting the claim in the Times that no fewer than seven people have heard about \u201cthe Yale incident.\u201d\n\nAs I write this at 6:30 p.m., the Times\u2019s editorial brain trust has been almost completely silent about the significant problems with its story. Politico came knocking with questions and was ignored. So was the Washington Post. The only person willing to comment thus far is deputy editorial page editor James Dao, who\u2019s \u2026 proud of the piece, calling it calling it \u201ca well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.\u201d Conservatives on social media this afternoon are convinced that the paper\u2019s going to try to follow Bloomberg\u2019s recent protocol in handling a garbage story published under its banner and simply memory-hole the controversy, waiting for everyone (except its right-wing critics, who don\u2019t matter) to lose interest.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just righties who are attacking the paper for its story. I noted Joe Scarborough\u2019s disgust with the Times this morning; there\u2019s no show on American television normally more friendly to Beltway media than his. David Folkenflik, NPR\u2019s media correspondent, tweeted early today that it\u2019s indisputable that the Times should have mentioned in its story that the alleged victim of the new assault accusation against a young Brett Kavanaugh has no memory of the incident. CNN is out with a story tonight calling the Kavanaugh story \u201cthe latest in [a] series of blunders from Opinion section.\u201d Trump has made an issue of it too, in case the Times thought it might run and hide until this blows over:\n\n\u201cThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.\u201d @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh \u2013 Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cHow many stories are wrong? Almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong.\u201d @greggutfeld The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys. The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn\u2019t even remember the event. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nI call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story, and while you\u2019re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony! They\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nI think they\u2019ll have to comment. They\u2019re not Bloomberg and this isn\u2019t a story about a lawyer at the Department of Labor whom no one\u2019s ever heard of. This is a paper that thinks of itself as a singular guardian of the public trust; and this is a story about a sitting Supreme Court justice allegedly sexually assaulting a woman while he was in college. If they had smeared a high Democratic official with material as thin as what they\u2019re using here, the uproar on the left would have already triggered a big newsroom bullsh*t session for the paper\u2019s staff to do some soul-searching together, like they did after the left\u2019s ridiculous meltdown over the Bad Headline involving Trump last month. The reason they haven\u2019t commented yet, I suspect, is because they\u2019ve thrown a few reporters at the claims made in this weekend\u2019s piece and are trying to nail something down that might let them save face. Can they find anyone who remembers hearing at the time that Kavanaugh assaulted Ramirez? Can they maybe get the supposed victim of the latest assault accusation to say that it *might* have happened, or at least that she found Kavanaugh to be a drunken lout on campus, etc? They\u2019ll have more to say about this. They\u2019re just busy right now trying to make it so that they can somehow say, \u201cWe were right all along.\u201d\n\nExit question via Jonathan Last: Is the Democratic reaction to this episode actually a trap for \u2026 Joe Biden?
