The move sparked an uproar among Trump\u2019s critics, who have accused him of betraying the US-backed Kurdish militia in the area which is now about to face a Turkish offensive.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Time to get out of these ridiculous endless wars\u2019: Trump orders US pullback from Syrian border before Turkish operation begins\n\nWhile yet again reminding his followers that Washington has wasted $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, this time Trump\u2019s laments went beyond the foolishly spent \u201ctrillions\u201d of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe went to war under a false & now disproven premise, weapons of mass destruction. There were none!\u201d Trump tweeted. This revelation is hardly surprising at this point, but what is surprising is to hear it put so bluntly from the president himself.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush, the man who dragged America into this quagmire in the first place, blamed it on faulty intelligence, while also regretting not finding the weapons of mass destruction. His successor Barack Obama, who used to portray himself as an opponent of the war in Iraq, never directly questioned the reasons for the invasion.\n\nDems and Reps slam Trump for betraying Kurdish allies after Syria pullout pic.twitter.com/Y5e7CHcvOj \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cThousands\u201d of American soldiers died or were wounded in the conflict, which took millions of lives \u201con the other side,\u201d Trump said \u2013 and he\u2019s not that far from the truth this time.\n\nThe war, which started in 2003 with the US invasion of Iraq and lasted for almost a decade up to 2011, cost the US almost 4,500 lives, according to various estimates. About half a million Iraqis died over the same period, in war and occupation. Some estimates put the figure at more than a million.\n\nNow, more than a decade and a half later, an American president admits that \u201cgoing into the Middle East is the worst decision ever made in the history of our country!\u201d\n\nThis mistake also proved to be a costly one. Although the president did not disclose the sources of his ever-increasing assessment of the US expenditure on its Middle Eastern war efforts (last time, he said it was $ 7 billion), other reports suggest America spent a hefty sum waging wars in the region \u2013 and dealing with their consequences.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH: Former US military base in N. Syria left deserted following withdrawal\n\nAccording to a report prepared by the Congressional Research Service back in 2014, the cost of the US war on terror had amounted to at least $1.6 trillion up to that point. Later, a 2016 Brown University study put the costs of US wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion over the period between 2001 and 2016, adding that they would likely reach $4.79 trillion by the end of 2017.\n\nA 2013 Harvard University working paper said that the cost of just two US wars \u2013 Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 could eventually amount to between $4 and 6 trillion, including the cost associated with long-term medical care and disability compensation for service members, veterans and families, military replenishment, and social and economic expenses.\n\nAlso on rt.com US wasted $15.5bn of taxpayer money in Afghanistan \u2013 govt watchdog\n\nIn July 2018, a US government watchdog revealed that more than $ 15 billion was wasted on futile reconstruction projects in Afghanistan alone, where America wages another seemingly everlasting conflict. The US invaded Afghanistan in 2001, following the devastating 9/11 attack, and attempted to remove the Taliban from power. Almost two decades later, it has failed to defeat the group.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
