Jim Himes, D-Conn., condemned officials for leaking to the media and sharing sensitive classified information with the public.\n\n\"I can\u2019t comment on the specifics of this case that CNN has broken. Our sources and our methods are the most closely guarded secrets we have,\" the House Intelligence Committee member told CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday.\n\nBut, Himes added, \"Unable, as I am to talk about the specifics of this case... this president has always been loose with the use of classified information. Two weeks ago... he tweeted out a satellite photograph of the destroyed Iranian missile on its launch pad. If you looked at that picture, you saw that it had a classification marker that had been blacked out.\"\n\n\"Being loose with this kind of information, which this president regularly does, is actually a direct assault on our security,\" Himes added.\n\nReferring to the CNN story, Himes said, \"I can offer a couple of points of perspective including... the notion that five government officials are actually talking to [CNN correspondent] Jim Sciutto. And look, I respect the press a lot, but what the heck?\n\n\"I mean, I remember a moment in time when we were all a-twitter[sic] because Hillary Clinton might have had classified e-mails on her laptop and here, five government officials apparently are talking about... one of the most guarded things, if it\u2019s true, that we have.\"\n\nHimes was referring to the exclusive story written by CNN's National Security Correspondent Jim Scuitto, which claimed the Trump administration was cavalier with classified information back in 2017 and put an American intelligence asset at risk.
