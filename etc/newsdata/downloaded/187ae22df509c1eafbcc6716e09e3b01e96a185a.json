You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf not, here\u2019s a quick rundown of your rights and what happens next.\n\nBut when things go wrong, it\u2019s often just for one or two people at a time and so there\u2019s no frenzy of media information. The risk of not knowing your rights is that you can\u2019t stand up for them when you\u2019ve been let down.\n\nSo, from flights to wedding cakes to financial advice, what are your rights and how can you enforce them if a company goes under?\n\nYour rights in a nutshell\n\nBefore we get into what you should expect if a business you\u2019re dealing with as a customer goes under, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to remember your rights in the first place.\n\nThere are certain consumer rights that are enshrined in law and cannot be ignored by companies. These are the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts Regulations \u2013 and any business that you deal with in the UK has to meet them.\n\nAll goods must be of satisfactory quality, they must be fit for purpose and they must be as described. If you have paid for something that does not fulfil those three criteria then you can claim for a refund or a repair or replacement, depending on how long you\u2019ve had the item.\n\nThat also goes for services, although there are some additional rights and protections when it comes to financial services.\n\nWhat are my extra protections for finances?\n\nThere are extra protections in place for when financial services providers go under and a good place to find out more is the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s website.\n\nPerhaps the best-known protection available to people is the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which pays out if certain types of regulated financial providers go under.\n\nFor example, if a bank, building society or credit union fails then it will compensate each account holder up to \u00a385,000. And if an investment firm fails and you can show it was negligent in its dealings with you, it may be possible to claim compensation via the scheme too.\n\nJust be aware that simply being regulated doesn\u2019t mean your money is safe.\n\nWho should I complain to?\n\nIf you buy an item and it\u2019s faulty then sometimes a retailer will try to suggest you approach the manufacturer for your refund but that\u2019s not necessary.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the retailer that is responsible because your agreement was with them and not the manufacturer. If you can\u2019t find your receipt then you can still prove where you bought it by showing a bank statement, for example.\n\nWhat if the retailer goes under?\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ve lost many high street names recently. When that happens, it can affect a customer\u2019s ability to enforce their rights.\n\nIf a trader or company goes under, there are a number of ways it could owe customers money. Perhaps they have paid for an item that has not yet been delivered or paid a deposit. They may be paying gradually or be holding vouchers or gift cards. Or they may have a faulty product that they had wanted to exchange for a refund.\n\nIn that situation, you need to contact the receiver or liquidator and complete a claim form \u2013 it\u2019s important to do that as quickly as you can. You may need to provide things such as receipts as evidence.\n\nAfter that, you join the list of creditors hoping to get some cash back. If you can\u2019t get a refund that way, then people who paid with a credit card have one last hope.\n\nCan I get any extra protection?\n\nIf you are confident that you can use credit responsibly, then one way to increase your protection is to consider paying for anything that costs more than \u00a3100 with a credit card.\n\nPaying for something using a credit card means the card provider becomes jointly liable with the seller if something goes wrong. So, if the retailer goes under or just won\u2019t help, you can begin a claim through the credit card company instead.\n\nThe reason for this extra protection is to ensure you don\u2019t end up with a debt for something you can\u2019t use.\n\nFor Thomas Cook customers who didn\u2019t have Atol protection or a travel insurance policy that covers this kind of event, claiming through their credit card provider was their only way to reclaim their money.\n\nWhat if the company that owes me cash is sold?\n\nIf the company is sold on, then it will usually be up to the new owners to decide whether they will honour old debts, unless they have bought the business with the old owners\u2019 liabilities.\n\nThat means they may refuse to honour gift vouchers issued before they took over, they may not carry out deliveries placed with the previous owner and they may refuse to repair or refund faulty products.\n\nAgain, in that situation, it\u2019s worth looking at whether you might be able to request a refund through your credit card company if you used one.\n\nHow about my warranty if the maker goes under?\n\nEven if the retailer you bought something through has gone under, you may still be able to use any warranty if the item you bought came with one. If it\u2019s a manufacturer\u2019s warranty then you approach them for a repair or refund.\n\nAnd if you paid extra for an extended warranty then don\u2019t despair. It\u2019s possible that extended cover was provided by a third-party insurer, so look at your paperwork to see if you can still make a claim.", "description": "By the time Thomas Cook collapsed, the writing had been on the wall for a while, but that didn\u2019t make it any less shocking.\u00a0 Both customers on holiday and those with future bookings felt suddenly cut adrift, desperate to understand what their rights were and whether their holiday or money was safe.
