(Picture: Netflix; Getty)\n\nLucifer\u2019s writing team have just dropped the title for the fourth episode of season five \u2013 and we think it\u2019s the most bonkers yet.\n\nThe writers have kept Lucifer fans waiting in suspense as they drop episode titles one-by-one, and they have definitely been getting harder for us to figure out.\n\nOn Wednesday they tweeted: \u2018I$ N#### E&&& W*** F\u201d\u201d T__ C@@@@@@\u2019 , alongside a couple of emojis including a thinking face, a devil and\u2026 a chicken.\n\nAnd in true fashion, the Lucifans put their own detective skills to work and guessed the title right.\n\nThey guessed that it could be either \u2018It Never Ends Well For The Captain\u2019 or \u2018It Never Ends Well For The Chicken\u2019 \u2013 and turns out the title for episode four is \u2018It Never Ends Well For The Chicken\u2019, but who could the chicken be?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking to social media many Lucifer fans are trying to guess who it could be, and many of you have suggested that the chicken is an actual chicken.\n\nTaking to Twitter lots of Lucifans think the chicken in question is, in fact, Ella\u2019s bathtub chicken\u2026Margaret.\n\nOther\u2019s have suggested it\u2019s Lucifer, but surely it can\u2019t be?\n\nFans are convinced something bad is going to happen to Margaret (Picture: Twitter)\n\nOne fan tweeted: \u2018I say this with the uttermost respect but don\u2019t you dare hurt Margaret or you\u2019ll be catching these hands.\u2019\n\nAnother commented: \u2018These comments\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen such an outcry of defense for a fictional chicken named Margaret.\u2019\n\nOne added: \u2018If it\u2019s not Margaret, then my brain jumps to Lucifer being the chicken because Chloe needs the eggs. Lucifer angst ahoy!\u2019\n\nLucifer surely isn\u2019t the chicken? (Picture: Netflix)\n\nShow bosses Joe Henderson and Ildy Modrovich previously said in a Q&A that a familiar face will be returning to the show now that Lucifer (Tom Ellis) is back on his throne in Hell.\n\nThe question would be who though?\n\nAlternatively, we could be getting an answer/throwback to jokes from previous seasons involving the ultimate question in the universe\u2026 \u2018why did the chicken cross the road?\u2019\n\nChloe previously joked to Lucifer about chickens, and Ella Lopez (Aimee Garcia) also owned a chicken at one point. Throw in a chicken emoji and things are getting complicated.\n\nIn the meantime, we know the title of the first three episodes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpisode one will be named Really Sad Devil Guy \u2013 which is appropriate seeing as he\u2019s been forced back down to look over Hell despite just admitting his love for Decker.\n\nIn the second, Lucifer! Lucifer! Lucifer!, it seems that someone is, at the very least, going to call him out, but that means nothing really when he can conjure up pretty much anything he wants.\n\nMore: Lucifer Lucifer season 5 episode 4 title clue teases it's not going to end well - but for who?
