I feel scared now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to go back to Albania. I hope the Home Office change their mind. Life is good here with John.\u2019\n\nMr Stokes said it feels as though the government has \u2018picked someone up from a life raft just to throw them back in the sea\u2019.\n\nThe carer, 66, claims the government is putting off decisions to grant asylum to unaccompanied child migrants until they turn 18.\n\nSamet wants to become a carpenter and is \u2018scared\u2019 he will be sent back to Albania (Picture: Tom Wren/SWNS)\n\nHe said: \u2018Because once they\u2019re 18 they are not technically children and they\u2019re easier to get out of the country.\u2019\n\nMr Stokes said Samet has been \u2018inspirational\u2019 for other English boys in the care system because \u2018despite the trauma he has an immense enthusiasm to turn his life around\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018He\u2019s outstanding at college. He\u2019s doing a second year carpentry course. All his results are outstanding.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s developed his English very well and he\u2019s doing everything right basically.\n\n\u2018But the main thing is, he has become part of the family.\u2019\n\nMr Stokes was one of the UK\u2019s first single male foster parents, but the fight to keep Samet in the country has made him doubt the whole system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018It calls into question whether after 30 years I should continue fostering because I don\u2019t know how I can support them anymore.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got another Albanian lad who is 20 and he\u2019s still with me. He\u2019s been with me for four years.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve both become part of the family. It may not be the most standard family but the two lads have been the most rewarding boys to work with because of their enthusiasm and keenness to succeed.\u2019\n\nA Home Office spokesperson would not go into Samet\u2019s ongoing case, telling Metro.co.uk: \u2018It would be inappropriate to comment whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.\u2019\n\nMr Stokes has launched a campaign to help Samet on Change.org in the hope the government will \u2018reconsider the life sentence they have given him\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
