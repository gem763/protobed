Based on Master Chief\u2019s original Halo 1 design, but also tweaked by Japanese mech designer Izmojuki, it\u2019s 1/12 scale and costs... $185.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot for a figure, but then, it\u2019s a very nice figure. Aside from Chief himself, it also includes a bunch of accessories, like five different sets of hands, an energy sword, two pistols and an assault rifle.\n\nI just love how matte he is, how perfectly-formed all the joints are, how posable he is without sacrificing his looks. He\u2019s also just the first in a whole line 1000toys are releasing based on Halo, so hopefully there\u2019s some guys and gals from Reach coming up soon as well.\n\nNo word on a release date, but the \u201c2020\" in the copyright on the images below is a very good clue.", "description": "There have been a lot of Halo figures over the years, but this new one by 1000toys is easily my favourite.
