That\u2019s a made-up term without legal significance. It is, however, what we are doing,\u201d Nadler said.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear for the last several months in filings with the court, in public statements, in official statements in the committee that we are conducting an investigation with the purpose, among other things, of determining whether to report Articles of Impeachment to the entire House,\u201d he continued.", "description": "", "authors": ["The Hill", "Thehill.Com Homenews House"], "top_image": ""}
