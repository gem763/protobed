A border patrol agent was hurt when \u201cthe driver accelerated\u201d while agents sought to remove the men from the truck. The men drove away in the truck but were later captured.\n\nFrom the CBP press release: Agents referred the vehicle for a more extensive inspection, during which agents determined the two occupants were citizens of Honduras. As agents attempted to extract the subjects from the vehicle, the driver accelerated, injuring an agent.
