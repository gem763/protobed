In a court filing Wednesday night, Johnson\u2019s attorneys said they\u2019ll pass up that opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the result, we take some satisfaction in proving that Alva was telling the truth about what her employer did to her. Namely, we uncovered video evidence that shows Trump grabbing Alva by the shoulders, pulling her in to him, and kissing her in front of numerous co-workers and others,\u201d lawyer Hassan Zavareei said. \u201cUnfortunately, that does not appear to be enough for our judge, who has expressed a very narrow view of what constitutes battery.\u201d\n\nJohnson said in a statement that she was dropping the case because of Jung\u2019s statements and threats she faced.\n\n\u201cI have made the difficult decision not to pursue my claims at this time. I am facing a judge who openly questions whether the kiss is worthy of a federal lawsuit and has determined that Mr. Trump\u2019s history of such behavior is not relevant, and I\u2019ve endured ongoing threats to my safety. I\u2019ve decided for the sake of my family that I will not continue with the case at this time,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAsked why the pay-discrimination aspect of the suit was also being dropped, Zavareei again cited Jung. He is a Trump appointee, but was originally nominated by President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we will get a fair hearing from this judge,\u201d Zavareei said.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team painted the decision as complete vindication for the president \u2014 and also indicated Trump\u2019s campaign may yet take legal action against Johnson.\n\n\u201cMs. Johnson\u2019s court filing last night, giving up the case, represents total victory for President Trump, and fully vindicates him of Johnson\u2019s false accusations,\u201d Trump attorney Charles Harder said. \u201cMs. Johnson\u2019s filing last night also fully vindicates the Trump Campaign, and verifies that the Trump Campaign fully complied with all applicable laws as to Ms. Johnson and all of its other employees.\u201d\n\nHarder accused Johnson of repeatedly violating a nondisclosure agreement she signed while working for Trump presidential bid.\n\n\u201cThe President and Campaign are weighing their legal options against Ms. Johnson at this time, and have demanded that she reimburse them for the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs they incurred in her failed lawsuit,\u201d Harder said. \u201cJust as the President defeated the Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawsuit and obtained an order requiring her to pay his legal fees, so too should Alva Johnson reimburse the President\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred here.\u201d", "description": "The suit grabbed headlines over the woman's assertion that Trump abruptly kissed her as he was getting ready to make a public appearance at a campaign rally.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/ac/e9178ed0443296b7a50b8424e4ae/190905-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
