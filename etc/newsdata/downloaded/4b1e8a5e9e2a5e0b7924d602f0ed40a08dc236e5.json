The team had hoped to power the exhibit by running a cable out, but that turned out not to be feasible, and \u201csolar power was the solution.\u201d\n\nSince then, Nathanson has been interested in the intersection of solar power and art. He managed Sunset, a Central Park art installation that consisted of a solar-powered ice cream truck, and he now teaches classes on art and engineering. During two recent Sundays, students at Pioneer Works, an art space in Brooklyn, learned to make sun-powered robots and low-voltage sound sculptures.\n\nAccording to Nathanson, many large \u201csolar installations\u201d are actually connected to the grid, so it\u2019s important to him that anything claiming to be \u201csolar-powered art\u201d actually uses functional solar cells instead of merely speculating about how the cells could be used, or using the cells only as decoration. To do so is greenwashing that erases the possibility of using solar materials to learn about physical craft and possible solutions to climate change, he says.\n\nIn Nathanson\u2019s class, the students \u2014 who don\u2019t need prior engineering experience \u2014 used upcycled solar cells from Jameco that came in a variety of shapes. The sound project had three parts: build the sound circuit, build the solar panel itself, and then connect the two. To execute this, the students learned engineering concepts (like series and parallel circuits, volts and amps, calculating output) as well as technical skills (such as how to use a soldering iron).\n\nThe final product makes an array of electronic sounds when placed in sunlight, depending on how the circuit and panels are built.\n\nThe sculptures came in various sizes. Some, like the one above, are made of acrylic and look more like mosaics. Others were made of balsa wood and were more triangular in shape.\n\nThe week before, the students had built a different art project: little solar-powered robots that moved.\n\nNathanson also maintains Solar Power for Artists, an archive of other projects. These range from Low Tech Magazine, a publication run on a mini-computer powered by off-grid solar energy, to the 1957 Solar Do-Nothing Machine, which is one of the first examples of using sunlight to generate electricity, which then powers a whimsical art installation.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the physical craft is a big part of understanding how to move to sustainable energy,\u201d Nathanson says. \u201cMany people didn\u2019t know how to solder before this class. I want to give them the tools to experiment and make things that function.\u201d", "description": "Photo essay based on a solar-powered art class taught by multimedia artist Alex Nathanson at the Brooklyn cultural space Pioneer Works.
