The targeted states include such big states with major cities as Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and, perhaps most shockingly, Massachusetts.\n\nThe boycott of the 22 states, nine of which were already verboten because of laws regarding homosexuality and transgenderism, was announced Wednesday and targets states that ban any abortions before the time \u2014 usually 24-28 weeks into a pregnancy \u2014 when an unborn baby can survive outside the womb.\n\n\u201cEvery day in this country, women\u2019s reproductive rights are threatened, and we have to fight back. Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms,\u201d Mayor London Breed said in a statement. \u201cBy limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.\u201d\n\nThe 13 newly blacklisted states, the Times reported, are Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nThe nine states that already were no-no\u2019s in San Francisco are Alabama, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
