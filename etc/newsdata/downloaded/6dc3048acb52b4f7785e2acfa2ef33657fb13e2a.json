Reuters\n\nUltimately, its goal is to bolster and improve reporting, as well as to ensure the swift removal of extremist content present on the Internet.\n\nFunded by industry contributions, GIFCT has, up until recently, been run by a rotating chair from one of the four founding companies, according to Bloomberg Quint.\n\nWhile, according to CPJ, policymakers in their own respective countries have separately taken action to \"eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online,\" particularly after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand in March, GIFCT is now moving forward as an independent body too.\n\nRead more: Execution videos, sex in the office, PTSD and ISIS sing-alongs: a day in the life of an online content moderator\n\nAccording to announcements made on Monday's gathering, the group will now be funded by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft and is set to become an entirely independent structure.\n\nAs well as receiving permanent staff, GIFCT will also receive a dedicated executive director.\n\nAt Monday's meeting, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has taken on an active role in combatting online extremism after March's massacre, said the structure would be led by a board of directors made up of Facebook representatives and an independent advisory committee would be made up of both government and civil roles.\n\n\"We can't wait until a moment like this happens again,\" Sandberg said. Allison Shelley/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to UN and European Union experts, respective governments in the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, France, and Japan will also be involved in an advisory capacity. While the industry will lead the forum's operating board, non-governmental groups will head an advisory board.\n\n\"We are trying to create a civil defense-style mechanism,\" said Ardern, addressing the United Nations General Assembly. \"The same way we respond to natural emergencies like fires and floods, we need to be prepared and ready to respond to a crisis like the one we experienced.\"\n\n\"When terrorists try to use one platform, they try to use all of them. So when one of us finds them, we can remove them from several platforms,\" she added.\n\nRead more: Facebook and Instagram deliberately condition you to use your phone like a drug, says this app developer\n\nThe ultimate goal of these structural changes will be to foster stronger collaboration between those government bodies and companies involved, uniting them in the goal to combat extremism and violence on online platforms.\n\nFacebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg told France 24 that, while there could have been 1.5 million views of the footage from the Christchurch shooting, the company successfully managed to prevent a total of roughly 1.2 million of these potential views before audiences had the chance to see it.\n\n\"We can't wait until a moment like this happens again,\" she said.\n\n\"We are trying to create a civil defense-style mechanism,\" said Ardern. Reuters\n\nPart of the structure's work will be to fund and coordinate academic research on terrorism and violent extremist operations, as well as best practices in data sharing, according to Ardern.\n\n\"If we want the greatest gains, we actually need to collaborate,\" added Ardern, according to a report in France 24. \"There is nothing we had seen, even at this point several months on, that has ever suggested to me that any of these tech companies had an interest in providing a platform for hatred and violence.\"", "description": "The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism will now be funded by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft and will be entirely independent.", "authors": ["Ruqayyah Moynihan", "Thomas Chenel", "Business Insider France"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a36cc2e22af0655480332?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
