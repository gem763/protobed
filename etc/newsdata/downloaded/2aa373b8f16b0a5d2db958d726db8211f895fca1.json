A second employee was charged with one count of the latter.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reported on the allegations against Girls Do Porn since August, when another case against the company\u2014a class-action lawsuit representing 22 Jane Does\u2014went to trial after years of hearings, discovery, and strategic delays from the defendants. The trial was initially planned for February, for example, but delayed for six months when the company\u2019s owner, New Zealand native Michael Pratt, filed for bankruptcy. \u201cAs soon as I bankrupt the business,\u201d Pratt wrote in texts later submitted as evidence, \u201cthey are fucked.\u201d\n\nIn the civil case, the same four accused\u2014owner Michael Pratt, colleague Matthew Wolfe, porn actor Andre Garcia and administrative assistant Valerie Moser\u2014faced accusations from the 22 Jane Does of coercing and defrauding them into adult movies. (Moser was released as a defendant and testified as a plaintiff\u2019s witness). The company allegedly conned the plaintiffs and several hundred other young, low-income girls into porn by making false promises that their scenes would not go online. They claimed the tapes would sell only to private collectors abroad.\n\nTo help make their case, the company allegedly paid other women to pose as references. But the videos inevitably went online, ending in harassment and doxxing for many of the models. The company was very popular\u2014 their videos accrued hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of views, and the websites generated around $17 million, court documents say.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of this federal criminal indictment, we are committed to moving forward with the civil trial that has been underway for eight weeks,\u201d Ed Chaplin, lead attorney for the civil case, said in a statement. \u201cWe want to get justice for the women that these men harmed as well as damages for the devastating events they lived through and have had to deal with ever since.\u201d\n\nIn the new complaint, federal prosecutors echo many of the claims made in the civil case\u2014citing instances where women were pressured or threatened into signing contracts, the hiring of fake \u201creferences,\u201d and mistreatment during shoots. After filming, some girls were not paid the agreed-upon fee. All would find their videos online within a matter of weeks. \u201cSome victims were harassed and ridiculed and estranged from their families as a result,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a press release Thursday, echoing The Daily Beast\u2019s reporting, \u201cand some were sexually assaulted and in at least one case raped.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda and Wolfe were arrested on October 9. Pratt fled the country last month, defying a subpoena to testify in the civil case. \u201cPratt is a fugitive,\u201d the complaint read. Later that night, the FBI raided the company\u2019s office in search of evidence of conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted, the group could face life in prison and a $250,000 fine. The minimum penalty for Pratt, Wolfe, and Garc\u00eda, who are facing all four charges, is 15 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the new charges could impact the civil case. \u201cWe are not 100% certain how this will affect our trial,\u201d Chaplin said. \u201cThe law says the judge has discretion to stay a civil case while the criminal matter is resolved. That means the judge has the option to put our trial on hold until the criminal matters are wrapped up. We will know more after court today. We are currently about two weeks away from finishing and would like to have our case resolved without delay.\u201d", "description": "In the wake of The Daily Beast\u2019s reporting, federal charges were filed against the owners and one employee of Girls Do Porn, which allegedly conned young women into XXX fare.", "authors": ["Tarpley Hitt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570757289/191010-Hitt-Girls-Do-Porn-conspiracy-tease_djafyy", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
