Liam doesn\u2019t say on the podcast that they split up in January or at the time of release of With You.\n\n\u2018That is The Sun\u2019s wrong interpretation of his quote. The couple 100 per cent split in July 2018 as was well documented. This is just an agenda driven story once again.\u2019\n\nThe couple had put on a united front at February 2018\u2019s Brit Awards red carpet, but announced they were parting ways just five months later.\n\nLiam revealed he had a great time working on the song with Rita, explaining: \u2018It was great, I really enjoyed making it.\n\n\u2018It was a lot of fun, she\u2019s great to work with as well. I don\u2019t know anyone who works harder, to be honest with you. She\u2019s f**king crazy.\u2019\n\nLiam also added that he and Cheryl struggled to go out in public together during their relationship, admitting: \u2018I think we kind of rubbed off on each other a little bit in that way.\n\nLiam is now dating model Maya Henry (Picture: Splash News)\n\n\u2018In a bad way, actually. And it was neither of our faults because we have both been through so many circumstances but all of that stuff puts so much pressure on a relationship.\n\n\u2018Say going out for a dinner or whatever it is, whereas now my whole new thing is that I don\u2019t give a s**t, it\u2019s not worth sacrificing my happiness and it\u2019s been far too long of different relationships that that\u2019s come between me [and them].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But that\u2019s a lot of pressure on whoever you\u2019re with, and I mean Cheryl\u2019s had that pressure for life. So for her, if you were going out somewhere, it would take so long to get out of the door because you\u2019re just so worried about what that shot\u2019s going to look lie.\n\n\u2018Whereas now I\u2019m just like \u201cf**k it\u201d, just go out and have some fun.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
