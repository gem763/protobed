CHEAP!\n\nMicrosoft recently unveiled the lineup for its third generation of Surface Laptops. It looks like a svelte, powerful device, but hold your horses before you rush to cop one, there might be a better deal: the first-gen Surface Laptop.\n\nYep, there\u2019s currently a brain-melting 61-percent discount on the inaugural Surface Laptop \u2014 it\u2019s available for just $1,049, that\u2019s $1,650 off the original price of $2,699. Woooooah.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound good to you? Hold up, I wasn\u2019t finished. This baby comes with a seventh-gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB (YES, you heard that right) of storage space.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you\u2019re getting for that money:\n\n13.5-inch PixelSense Touchscreen Display (2256 x 1504) resolution\n\nIntel HD Graphics 620\n\nA copy of Windows 10 (duh)\n\nOne-year Microsoft warranty\n\nA smooth keyboard and trackpad experience\n\n1,25 kilos of absolutely gorgeous design\n\nI haven\u2019t personally used this Surface Laptop, but my colleague Napier Lopez had lots of good things to say about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Mac user, I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cNo way I\u2019m blowing my pocket on a Windows laptop.\u201d In the words of the glorious Samuel L. Jackson, well, allow me to retort.\n\nSince switching to Mac in 2012, I\u2019ve dreaded going back to Windows. I\u2019d wake up at night, bald head covered in sweat, panicked my MacBook had broke. But over the past month, I\u2019ve learned I\u2019ve got nothing to fear. My experience with the Razer Blade (review upcoming) has illuminated me to the amazing progress Windows laptops have made in recent years.\n\nThey\u2019re actually pretty good. You\u2019ll still need to give yourself some time to get accustomed, but trust me \u2014 things do get better. And good luck getting a 1TB MacBook at that price.\n\nAnd with with 61 percent off the original price of $2,699 (that\u2019s a full $1,650 discount, if you\u2019re bad at math), there\u2019s no better time than now to make the shift.\n\nTake a leap through the window, get on Windows now.
