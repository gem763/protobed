He was dead to me a long time ago,' Boris said.\n\n'Australia is rid of one of the notorious serial killers, psychopaths.'\n\nThe 77-year-old, who is 'embarrassed' to be a Milat, said be bears no burden of grief for his late brother.\n\n'He deserves where he is and he deserves what he's got,' he said.\n\nBoris suspected money may have been involved in Milat's killings.\n\nHe murdered people for the joy of killing and the fact he knew he could get away with it, he said.\n\nWhen asked about the backpackers and how their lives were tragically cut short, Boris said he would get 'emotional'.\n\nBoris was then forced to excuse himself from the interview before returning in tears.\n\nHe said 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown was pulling on his 'heartstrings' before adding that 'people have the right to die properly'.\n\nMilat is pictured with Maureen who he had an intimate relationship with for about one-year. She married Milat's brother Wally\n\nMaureen (pictured) said she believe's Milat is far from innocent and struggles to understand how the Milat family deny the murders\n\n'Seeing he's dead now, the whole saga is best forgotten but remember the victims\u2026 remember these innocent people as well,' he said.\n\nBoris also slammed his family for believing Milat's denial and claiming the police made it all up.\n\nHe said they must have 'small IQ's' because a 12-year-old child would be able to figure out Milat was a murderer.\n\nIvan's former sister-in-law Maureen said Milat died to her '20 or so years ago'.\n\nMaureen was married to Milat's brother Wally but admitted she had an intimate relationship with the serial killer 'on and off' for about one-year.\n\n'That's a part of my life I'm not really proud of... At certain points\u2026 just things happen,' she said.\n\nBut Maureen said she too hated Milat and was in no way defending the killer.\n\n'I believe he did it. He's not innocent,' she said.\n\n'To me, he died 20 odd years ago, when he was arrested for this. I have no feelings whatsoever. He's just a person that's died. I'd rather remember the person I knew \u2013 a nice person.'\n\nMilat's seven victims were Melbourne couple Deborah Everist (top left) and James Gibson (bottom right), both 19, English backpackers Joanne Walters (bottom left) and Caroline Clarke (bottom second from right), and German backpackers Anja Habschied (top centre), Simone Schmidl (top right) and Gabor Neugebauer (bottom second from left)\n\nMilat served seven life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers, including British tourists Caroline Clarke (left) and Joanne Walters (right)\n\nShe added it was a 'bit creepy' to have had a relationship with a psychopath.\n\nMaureen said she believe's Milat is far from innocent and struggles to understand how the Milat family deny the murders.\n\n'They all stick together... they're a strong group, strong family,' she said.\n\nRetired NSW police Assistant Commissioner John Laycock said there are a lot of questions still to be answered in the wake of Milat's death.\n\nWhen asked if he suspected if there were more bodies buried, Mr Laycock said he believed in the possibility.\n\n'He wouldn't plead guilty to breathing, and he certainly wouldn't confess to a murder, or to a homicide,' he said.\n\nMilat was hospitalised in May and again earlier this month for stomach and throat cancer before being returned to the hospital wing of the jail on Tuesday.\n\nHis death was slow and painful as the cancer spread to his liver, lungs, bones and lymph nodes and he developed fluid on his heart.\n\nMilat (pictured at home before his arrest) was serving seven life sentences for the murder of seven backpackers in bushland south of Sydney\n\nMilat's body will be transferred to the New South Wales State Coroner who will decide, after consultation with his family, how it will be disposed.\n\nThere will be an inquest into his death, as is the case with all deaths in custody.\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the investigation into the killings, said there are at least three unsolved murders with good reasons to suspect Milat.\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven backpackers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney.\n\nHis victims were English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters 22; Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19; and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nPictured is a room in the hospital section of Long Bay prison where Milat died on Sunday\n\nHe stabbed most, decapitated one whose head has never been found and shot another 10 times in the head as if using her for target practice.\n\nMany were knifed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.\n\n'These seven young persons were at the threshold of their lives, with everything to look forward to - travel, career, happiness, love, family, and even old age,' said Justice David Hunt who jailed Milat for life in 1996.\n\n'It is clear that they were subjected to behaviour which, for callous indifference to suffering and complete disregard of humanity, is almost beyond belief.\n\n'They would obviously have been absolutely terrified, and death is unlikely to have been swiftly applied.'", "description": "Milat's brother Boris, who is the only member of the family clan to publicly denounce the serial killer, said it was a 'big relief' that Milat is dead.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/20243194-0-image-a-6_1572179687057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
