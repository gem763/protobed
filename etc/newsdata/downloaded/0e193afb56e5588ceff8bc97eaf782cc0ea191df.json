Over the last 18 months, many of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed have sought out Border Patrol agents, rather than hiding from them, in order to request asylum.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new policies have played a role in sharply reducing these numbers, but they also appear to be driving people further underground. In a single day last week, Border Patrol agents in the city of Laredo, Tex., apprehended 111 people crammed into the backs of three different tractor-trailers, one of which was 104 degrees inside when it was opened.\n\nA caller alerted the agents to one of the vehicles, sending more than a dozen officers from the local police and the Border Patrol to the scene. The agents surrounded the unmarked truck, and prepared to grab anyone who tried to flee. When they unlocked the trailer, they found 41 men and women, plus two 17-year-olds, seated quietly with their backs against the wall. Some had tears streaming down their faces as they jumped to the ground and were loaded into police vans.", "description": "A growing number of migrants, blocked at the border by new immigration policies, are using riskier tactics to get in.", "authors": ["Caitlin Dickerson", "Lynsey Addario", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/00asylum-07/00asylum-07-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
