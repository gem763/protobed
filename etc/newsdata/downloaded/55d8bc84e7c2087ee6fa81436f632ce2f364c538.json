Laura revealed that she, along with almost every other woman (and many men) she knew in the media, had had the odd jab.\n\nBut not me. I have never had Botox or fillers or any of the multitude of cosmetic treatments available to make us look younger.\n\nThere was a time when people spoke in whispers about having a face-lift, which would require them to go missing in action for weeks until it healed and the bandages could come off.\n\nI have never had Botox or fillers or any of the multitude of cosmetic treatments available to make us look younger (file image)\n\nOr when we wondered if someone had had \u2018plastic surgery\u2019, a term now as quaint as gingerbread.\n\nToday, Botox injections and so-called tweakments are so popular that anyone can drop in for a lunchhour fix and still have time to queue for a Leon wrap.\n\nBaby Boomers on the march We're always hearing about the activism of the young. How every millennial worth their water bottle is fighting for a cause. But really, the most consistent group of protesters are those who have long been in possession of their Freedom Pass. Whether it\u2019s waving a placard in support of Extinction Rebellion or taking part in yesterday\u2019s People Vote march, it\u2019s the baby-boomers rather than millennials who can be relied upon to turn up. Most of the millennials I know spent Saturday with their toddlers in the local baby gym or filling a trolley at Homebase. Their parents, though, have spent all week working out in which London cafe to rendezvous. They came of age in the 1960s, that era of the demo, and are completely at home on a good march. Not only that, but now freed from the demands of a career, a mortgage and childcare, it\u2019s the oldies who have the time to get out, marching at a brisk pace while they share photos of their grandchildren on Instagram.\n\nYoung women in their 20s are urged to do a bit of this and that as an \u2018investment\u2019 for the future. Sadly, even some teenagers are regular Botox kids.\n\nThere are easy and supposedly safe options to correct everything. You can get rid of wrinkles, fill the grumpy face droop around the mouth, lift the eyelids, firm the jaw. Any or all of these would, without any question, improve my appearance. So why don\u2019t I take advantage of them?\n\nIT\u2019S not because I particularly subscribe to going natural \u2013 after all I\u2019m no stranger to my treasured Josh Wood hair colourist. And it\u2019s not because I think we should learn to love our crow\u2019s feet and under-eye bags \u2013 I find them as dismaying as anyone else.\n\nI don\u2019t condemn those who choose to have any treatments.\n\nBut I can\u2019t bear the thought of doing it to myself. I hate the idea that underneath all the stuff injected into my skin there would lurk my real face, my hidden portrait in the attic, ageing unseen and ready to shock me if I ever saw it.\n\nInstead, I feel safer confronting what is happening with acceptance, rather than indulging in a King Canute-like battle with the unstoppable forces of time. But for the first time, now so many people around me are perked up with a nip here and jab here and look at least a decade younger, I am beginning to wonder if my attitude is perverse and perhaps a bit peculiar.\n\nIs there something odd about deliberately allowing yourself to look less good than you might?\n\nAnd by not taking advantage of any of this stuff, am I starting to sound as old-fashioned as someone who still regards aspirin as a suspiciously new-fangled drug?\n\nTrust me, Theresa it's best to go quietly\n\nWhen you leave a big job, you are always advised to keep quiet about your successor\u2019s progress. Not easy if you are Theresa May, since her job as an MP requires her to make a contribution to debates in the House of Commons.\n\nShe has kept a very low profile since leaving office, but last week she poked her nose above the parapet with a critique of the Johnson/Patel immigration policy.\n\nCue immediate reports of her \u2018taking a thinly veiled swipe\u2019 at her successor. It wasn\u2019t a thinly veiled anything. It was straightforward criticism, based on her knowledge and experience.\n\nBut if she mutters anything other than a full-fat endorsement of the new regime, she will always be accused of petty sniping from the back seat.\n\nNo wonder David Cameron legged it as quickly as he did.\n\nWhen you leave a big job, you are always advised to keep quiet about your successor\u2019s progress. Not easy if you are Theresa May, since her job as an MP requires her to make a contribution to debates in the House of Commons.

We\u2019ve had our first crop of figs. Rob, who helps me in the garden, said the tree would never fruit in London but I knew it would.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m enjoying my moment of horticultural superiority, deep down it\u2019s made me anxious. I prefer my experts to be in the right.\n\nIt\u2019s always worrying when you discover you know more than the person you\u2019ve put your trust in.\n\nWe\u2019ve had our first crop of figs.

Overnight it\u2019s become unrecognisable, like a child hitting their teens. And all because of one of those regular Apple upgrades. As far as I was concerned there was nothing that needed upgrading. Apps working. Voicemail received. Email functioning. I had it all under control. But now I\u2019m in a strange land filled with options I don\u2019t require and confusing layouts I can\u2019t navigate.\n\nIs a \u00a3400 hairdryer just a load of hot air?\n\nOf all the many riveting insights into the way we shop now, afforded by the John Lewis annual report, I was amazed by the huge numbers of Dyson Airwrap hairdryers sold at over \u00a3400 a pop. What could possibly make a hairdryer worth that kind of money?
