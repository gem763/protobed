ABC\u2019s David Muir asked whether she would \u201cbring the [American] troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban.\u201d Warren replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIn Houston, Warren\u2019s rivals also refused to condition America\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan on a negotiated deal. When Muir asked Buttigieg whether he would stick to his pledge to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in his first year despite warnings from top American commanders, Buttigieg ducked the question and insisted that \u201cwe have got to put an end to endless war.\u201d Turning to Biden, Muir cited \u201cconcerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan.\u201d But Biden brushed them off, declaring, \u201cWe don\u2019t need those troops there. I would bring them home.\u201d\n\nWhat makes these statements so remarkable is that experts warn that if the United States withdraws its troops from Afghanistan in the absence of a peace agreement, Afghanistan will suffer a fate remarkably similar to what is happening in northern Syria. In this week\u2019s debate, Warren denounced Trump for having \u201ccreated a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis.\u201d But earlier this month, the International Crisis Group warned that, if American troops unilaterally leave Afghanistan, \u201cAfghans could pay a heavy price\u201d as that country\u2019s war \u201cwould likely intensify and become more chaotic.\u201d A Rand Corporation report in January predicted that following a unilateral American withdrawal, \u201ccivilian deaths will spike, and refugee flows will increase significantly,\u201d and that \u201cthe major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women\u2019s emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back.\u201d In September, nine former American diplomats with experience in Afghanistan pleaded, \u201cA major withdrawal of US forces should follow, not come in advance of [a] real peace agreement,\u201d or else the United States might \u201cbetray all those who have believed our promises or stepped forward with our encouragement to promote democracy and human rights.\u201d\n\nPeter Beinart: The two psychological tricks Trump is using to get away with everything\n\nAfghans themselves have offered equally ominous warnings. In February, two Afghan women\u2014Mariam Safi, who runs the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies in Kabul, and Muqaddesa Yourish, a commissioner on Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission\u2014predicted that \u201ca hasty American withdrawal will jeopardize for Afghans the future of hard-won gains such as constitutional rights, freedoms of citizens and democratic institutions.\u201d In March, Palwasha Hassan, the executive director of the Afghan Women\u2019s Educational Center, urged \u201ca responsible withdrawal that is not at the expense of women\u2019s rights.\u201d And in July, Akram Gizabi, a leader of Afghanistan\u2019s Hazaras, a Shia minority, noted that his people had suffered under the Taliban in \u201cbrutal, vicious and unimaginable ways\u201d and that \u201cwomen and Hazaras [had] thrived after the Taliban.\u201d Now, Gizabi said, Taliban victims \u201cwatch with amazement that the United States is busy finding the fastest way out of Afghanistan, while leaving the Afghans to the wolves.\u201d", "description": "Presidential hopefuls blasted Trump for abadoning the Kurds\u2014but want the U.S. to pull out of Afghanistan under similar conditions.", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Professor Of Journalism At The City University Of New York"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2POQB/facebook.jpg?1571342134", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
