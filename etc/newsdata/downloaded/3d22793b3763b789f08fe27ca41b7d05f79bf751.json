Do you know I am not the only one who suffered sexual violence by the police? Other arrestees have suffered sexual assaults and torture by more than one officer, regardless of gender,\u201d Ng said.\n\nNg clarified that the attack she referenced took place Kwai Chung Police Station instead of the holding center, during a radio interview on Friday, but she said she was told there were also sexual assaults at the center.\n\nThis is not the first time Hong Kong\u2019s police have been accused of acting illegally towards protesters. An Amnesty International report last month claimed the police were assaulting and protesters in custody, acts that amounted to torture.\n\nHong Kong police responded to the claims late on Thursday night, saying they would investigate.\n\nREAD: China called the app Hong Kongers use to avoid tear gas 'poisonous.' So Apple removed it.\n\n\u201cPolice accord high priority to such a serious allegation,\u201d the force stated, adding: \u201cWe will proactively contact the [woman] and appeal to her to provide concrete evidence so that we can launch a fair fact-finding investigation as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut Ng said Friday she found the police statement ominous.\n\n\u201cI felt that the police statement was threatening me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said they would contact me directly. Does it mean that they can catch me again and [detain me] for another 48 hours?\u201d\n\nNg said she had received phone calls from mainland Chinese numbers after the police statement, something that had not happened before.\n\nREAD: An NBA fan was ejected from a game in Philly for yelling 'free Hong Kong'\n\nNg\u2019s worries would have have been compounded by comments made by Police Deputy Commissioner Tang Ping Keung on Friday claiming Ng could be arrested for slander along with her family.\n\n\u201cThis is a groundless accusation which could lead to criminal charges. Her parents could also be charged for aiding and abetting.\"\n\nCover: Protesters march with face mask during a flash mob protest in Hong Kong, on Friday, Oct. 11, 2019.
