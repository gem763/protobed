Our thoughts are with their families far away.\n\n\u2018In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel also laid wreaths to remember those who died as they visited Thurrock Civic Offices for a remembrance ceremony, joined by senior local dignitaries and Essex emergency services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt came as the driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, 25, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates\u2019 Court charged with 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe message left by Prime Minister Boris Johnson (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe discovery of the bodies inside the refrigerated trailer has sparked the biggest murder investigation in Essex Police\u2019s history.\n\nFour people have been arrested after the eight women and 32 men were found dead in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nA 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was arrested at Stansted Airport on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nEarlier that day, a couple named locally as haulage boss Thomas Maher and his wife Joanna, both 38, were arrested on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter and people trafficking.\n\nEssex Police initially believed all the victims were Chinese nationals, but after reports some may have been Vietnamese, the force said on Friday \u2018this is now a developing picture\u2019 and said it would give no further details until formal identification takes place.\n\nPolice have yet to identify any of the dead, saying the coroner must first establish each person\u2019s cause of death before officers move on to attempt to identify individuals.\n\nThis will be a \u2018substantial operation\u2019 and the force \u2018cannot estimate how long these procedures will take\u2019.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson stands with the Chief Constable of Essex Police, Ben-Julian Harrington, after they laid flowers during a visit to Thurrock Council Offices (Picture: PA)\n\nPolice began to move the bodies of the victims on Thursday evening, with 11 bodies being moved to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford under a police escort and private ambulance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the bodies are due to be moved and post-mortem examinations carried out.\n\nThe tractor unit or front section of the lorry, which police said is believed to have originated in Northern Ireland, entered the country via Holyhead, north Wales, on October 20, having travelled over from Dublin.\n\nGlobal Trailer Rentals Ltd (GTR) confirmed they owned the refrigerated back section of the lorry where the bodies were found and said they had leased the trailer on October 15.\n\nThe lorry trailer, where the bodies were found, travelled on a ship from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, Essex, arriving at around 12.30am on Wednesday.\n\nPolice believe the tractor unit and trailer left the port in Purfleet shortly after 1.05am.\n\nThe lorry was later moved under police escort from the industrial park to a secure location at Tilbury Docks.\n\nThe incident is the worst of its kind in the UK since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container at Dover, Kent, in 2000.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
