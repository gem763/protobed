It did not say why the drone crashed, but said \u201cthere is no concern information could be taken from it\u201d. An Israeli military spokeswoman said it was a \u201csimple drone\u201d without elaborating.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters had used \u201cappropriate weapons\u201d to bring down the drone on the edge of the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah.\n\nA correspondent for Hezbollah\u2019s al-Manar television reporting from the border said the drone had not sustained much damage, and had been in Lebanese airspace for around five minutes.\n\nA week ago, after a drone attack in a Hezbollah-controlled Beirut suburb, Hezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged cross-border fire that marked their fiercest shelling exchange since the 2006 Lebanon war.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, as well as Lebanon\u2019s government, blamed Israel for the drone attack and had vowed to target Israeli drones entering Lebanon\u2019s airspace.\n\nNasrallah said while last Sunday\u2019s flare-up with Israel at the border was over, the episode had launched a \u201cnew phase\u201d in which the Iran-backed group no longer had red lines it would not cross.\n\nIn that brief exchange of fire, Hezbollah said it destroyed an Israeli armoured vehicle, killing and wounding those inside, and broadcast what it said was footage of two missiles hitting a moving vehicle.\n\nIsrael said it had faked soldier casualties to dampen any inclination of Hezbollah to escalate hostilities.\n\nNasrallah said the attack marked the first such operation by Hezbollah in a long time targeting positions inside Israel itself and not just inside the Israeli-occupied Shebaa farms, which Lebanon says belongs to Lebanon.\n\nAmid rising tensions in the region, Israel also raised the stakes last week by accusing Hezbollah, with Iranian assistance, of setting up a factory for precision-guided missiles in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa valley.\n\nHezbollah has denied having production sites in Lebanon, but says it does possess precision-guided missiles.\n\nLast week\u2019s drone attacks and cross-border shelling came after Hezbollah, whose forces have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s war, said two of its men were killed in an Israeli strike in Syria late last month.\n\nIsrael said its attack in Syria thwarted an Iran-led drone strike against it.\n\nA Reuters witness at the Lebanese border near where the drone fell said the area was calm on Monday morning.\n\nAny new war between Israel and Hezbollah would raise the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East, at a time when Iran is defying U.S. attempts to force it to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal it reached with world powers.\n\nIsrael is alarmed by Iran\u2019s growing influence in the region through militia allies in countries including Syria and Iraq.", "description": "Iran-backed Hezbollah said it downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon early on Monday, a week after the group's leader said it would shoot down Israeli drones in Lebanese airspace.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
