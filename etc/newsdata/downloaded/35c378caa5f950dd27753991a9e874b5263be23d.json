Why are you shy about showing your breasts? Is there something wrong with them?\"\n\nThe show has drawn considerable attention, much of it very negative.\n\nSome fans were appalled that the people of the tribe had to see Scarlett and family live in a house kitted out with 20,000 possessions, running water and Wi-Fi.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nOne scene saw Scarlett ask who wanted her leftover crusts as the tribe milked goats and ate porridge.\n\nOne tribesmen scolded: \"We want livestock. What are we going to do with a house?\"\n\nA tribeswoman wondered why Scarlett had so many possessions as she was being given a tour about the house.\n\n\"I find it strange for one person to have many things,\" she said, \"Scarlett doesn't need that many things.\"\n\nAnother laughed that Scarlett was \"like a shapeshifter\" because of her comsetics.\n\nOne disgruntled viewer wrote: \"How on earth did @Channel4 think this was OK?? I'm totally shocked and appalled at #TheBritishTribeNextDoor.\"\n\nAnother added: \"This show makes me feel sooooooo uncomfortable the whole 'woooo look at us, we're CIVILISED' vibe is very OFF.\"\n\nMirror Online has reached out to Channel 4 for comment.", "description": "WARNING: Contains graphic images of nudity.
