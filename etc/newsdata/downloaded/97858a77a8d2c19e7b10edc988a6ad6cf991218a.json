He is pictured on his private jet, which he has reportedly now sold\n\nThe Formula One driver, 34, uploaded a series of posts on Tuesday. In this one, he told his 13.1 million followers that he felt like 'giving up on everything'\n\nHamilton - pictured racing in Japan - switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 and in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London\n\nThe posts sparked accusations of hypocrisy from some Twitter users, while others defended him\n\nHamilton wrote in the posts: \u2018Go vegan, it is the only way to truly save our planet today. It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it.\n\n\u2018Honestly I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\u2019\n\nThe posts sparked accusations of hypocrisy from some Twitter users, with Alastair Russell writing: 'Lewis Hamilton urging people to go vegan to save the planet as he drives a massive-engined race car around the world.'\n\nLondon Assembly Susan Hall wrote: 'Erm - if we all go vegan would that allow some to continue to motor race and fly around the world in private jets etc. if that is your thought process\n\n'I would suggest you either keep quiet or sack your pr advisor. Very disappointed as am a huge fan of yours.'\n\nAnother user commented: 'Lewis Hamilton (laugh!) he who pollutes the planet probably 5 times more(?) than most with exhaust emissions.'\n\n\n\nHamilton switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 and in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London. He reportedly also sold his red private jet earlier this year.\n\nThe racing driver started the series of posts by saying he was 'sad right now with the thought of where this world is going', before claiming humans were at risk of 'extinction'.\n\nHamilton then suggested people had been 'lied to' about the value of eating meat and that cutting out animal products altogether was necessary to save the world.\n\nHe added: 'I urge you to do some research, find the compassion I know you have within you to recognise what you are contributing to in terms of what you eat which keeps the meat and dairy industry flourishing and therefore deforestation, animal cruelty, our seas and climate decaying on a daily basis.'\n\n'Extinction of our race is becoming more and more likely': Lewis Hamilton's full Instagram post Hey world, I hope everyone\u2019s enjoying their day. I\u2019m sad right now with the thought of where this world is going. Extinction of our race becoming more and more likely as we over use our resources. The world is a messed up place. World leaders either uneducated or don\u2019t care about the environment at all. Agriculture farming is the largest pullutant (sic) we currently have by over 50 per cent, far more than our travel industry combined. I\u2019m sad to see so many people, even close friends ignore what is happening daily. Education is key and we were taught that eating animal products was good for us but we\u2019ve been lied to for 100s of years. It\u2019s taken me 32 years to understand the impact I am having on the world and I\u2019m figuring out daily what I can do to play a better part. I want my life to mean something and honestly up until now my life\u2019s had no meaning. Being a part of the issue is not meaningful. Being part of the solution is and I\u2019m striving to do better. I urge you to do some research, find the compassion I know you have within you to recognise what you are contributing to in terms of what you eat which keeps the meat and dairy industry flourishing and therefore deforestation, animal cruelty, our seas and climate decaying on a daily basis. Go vegan, it is the only way to truly save our planet today. It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it. Honestly I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\n\nSome fans expressed their concern about his comments saying he 'felt like giving up on everything'.\n\nOne wrote: 'Please don't give up on the world. There are people that care, whilst the world may seem c**p at times you have to look for the positives. I promise you there are some.'\n\nAnother fan typed: 'I am so concerned about Lewis. Hope he is ok.'\n\nBack in August, the racing driver unveiled his plans to open a new vegan burger restaurant chain, in a bid to reduce greenhouse emissions created by livestock.\n\nHe opened his first plant-based Neat Burger restaurant last month, which sells vegan burgers called 'Neat', 'Cheese' and 'Chick\u2019n'.\n\nLivestock are a major driver of climate change - accounting for nearly 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions - while producing meat uses land and water less efficiently than crops, according to the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nThe racing driver previously spoke about his own decision to go vegan two years ago. He told the BBC: ' I stopped eating red meat two years ago, I have generally been pescatarian for the majority of the year and now I've cut fish.\n\n'As the human race, what we are doing to the world... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible.\n\n'They say it is more than what we produce with our flights and our cars, which is kind of crazy to think, the cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.'\n\nHamilton was recently denied victory at the Japanese Grand Prix that survived the typhoon by a rare mistake by all-conquering Mercedes (pictured winner Valtteri Bottas)\n\nIt comes after Lewis was denied victory at the Japanese Grand Prix that survived the typhoon by a rare mistake by all-conquering Mercedes.\n\nThe race was instead won by Valtteri Bottas \u2013 a one-three finish that secured the constructors' title for the Brackley-based outfit for a record sixth consecutive time.\n\nAnd Lewis expects he will have to wait beyond Mexico, the next race on the calendar and one that could be a struggle for his Mercedes team, to secure his sixth Formula One world championship.\n\n'For me, it's never been a case of always wanting to rush things,' he said.\n\n'I think Mexico is generally our worst race of the year because of the way our car is set up and it's going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking, even though we've won the title there.\n\n'I don't anticipate it (the decider) will be Mexico. I think we will be battling for a good few races.'\n\nThe posts were later deleted.", "description": "The British 34-year-old, who is on the verge of winning a sixth Formula One world title, made clear his feelings about the state of the world in three posts on Instagram yesterday.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk", "Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19783670-0-image-a-17_1571222996208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
