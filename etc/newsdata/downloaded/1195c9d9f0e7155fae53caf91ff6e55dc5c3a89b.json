Trump won. There\u2019s been no recession.\n\nBut those forecasters weren\u2019t wrong. Research from Moody\u2019s Analytics, Citigroup, Oxford Economics and many other firms predicted a recession if Trump did everything he promised to do as a candidate. Those campaign promises included a large tax cut and aggressive deregulation, which have, in fact happened.\n\nBut Trump also promised things he hasn\u2019t done yet, such as deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, who account for about 5% of the U.S. labor force. He also vowed to impose 45% tariffs on everything imported from China and 35% tariffs on Mexican imports, and to withdraw from the trade deal with Canada and Mexico if those two trading partners didn\u2019t meet his demands.\n\nThe scarier part of Trump\u2019s economic agenda is gradually falling into place\u2014and the economy is swooning the way forecasters predicted in 2016. He struck a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico last year, pre-empting new tariffs on those countries. But trade negotiations with China have obviously been rockier, with no deal in sight and tariffs mounting on both sides.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a press conference on the third and final day of the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France Monday, Aug. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) More\n\nTrump\u2019s latest move, announced on Twitter Aug. 23, was to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese imports up to levels ranging from 15% to 30%, with deadlines ranging from Sept. 1 to December 15. China has announced similar tariffs on similar deadlines on U.S. imports to China. We\u2019re getting closer, in other words, to the 45% tariffs Trump threatened as a candidate.\n\nSlowing economy\n\nStocks rose sharply during Trump\u2019s first year in office, but they\u2019ve flatlined since January 2018, which is when his protectionist trade actions began. The economy is slowing too, after hitting 2.9% growth in 2018. There\u2019s a marked slowdown in manufacturing, and employers have been cutting back on hours. The next step, normally, is to cut back on payrolls.\n\nEconomists forecast GDP growth of 2.3% this year and just 1.8% next year, according to Bloomberg. That\u2019s not recessionary\u2014but Trump may push his China tariffs even higher, forcing growth lower. Despite Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he wants a deal, and China wants a deal, trade experts think the standoff with China could get worse before it gets better. \u201cThe two sides [are] headed toward further escalation,\u201d analysts at Eurasia Group wrote recently. \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are moving the dispute further away from the substance of a trade deal.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of a recession during the next 18 months now turns directly on what Trump does on trade. \u201cIf the U.S. raises tariffs on all imports from China to 25% and China makes a matching response with those measures staying in place for 4-6 months, we believe that the global economy will be in recession in 6-9 months,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a recent note.\n\nThe U.S. can avoid a recession if the rest of the world is in one, and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve might help offset some of the damage caused by tariffs. It\u2019s also possible a plunging stock market will get Trump\u2019s attention and dissuade him from escalating further. Trump still has some control over whether the Trump Recession happens.\n\nSign up!
