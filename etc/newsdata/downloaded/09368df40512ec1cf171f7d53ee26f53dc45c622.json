(Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nSeveral specks, so few and minuscule that millions can cram onto a penny. That\u2019s approximately how much lead-laced dust rested on a window well in the master bedroom of Tiffany Dragos\u2019s newly purchased farm house in Ashton, Md.\n\nThat amount \u2014 440 micrograms per square foot \u2014 slightly exceeds what Maryland and many other states consider safe.\n\nIngested or breathed in, lead \u2014 a toxic metal once widely used in paint, pipes and finishes \u2014 accumulates in bones and harms the brain and kidneys, among other organs. Lead poisoning especially affects pregnant women and children, permanently impairing their physical, behavioral and mental health.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 90 percent of abodes constructed before 1940 nationwide are likely to have lead. That probability declines for the subsequent decades, but today any home built before 1978, when lead-based paint succumbed to a national ban, is presumed to contain the element, which can also permeate water and soil.\n\n\n\nChips of paint were found on the ground beneath the outside wall in the background. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nDragos knew that the 1703 farm house, where she envisions raising kids, could be a trove of lead risks.\n\n\u201cThere could be tons of lead in the house or maybe there is only a little,\u201d Dragos said. \u201cIt was very hard for me to make a decision [to buy] because I was feeling very confused and emotional.\u201d\n\n[Kitchen remodels are a big (and expensive) undertaking. Make sure you pick the right approach for you.]\n\nUnder federal statute, home buyers of pre-1978 residences must receive any known information about lead and be granted the opportunity to conduct an inspection. The District of Columbia, where nearly 90 percent of the housing stock emerged before 1978, also decrees that home sellers disclose any orders from local authorities to mitigate lead hazards.\n\nMore than a matter when properties switch hands or welcome new renters, lead exposure is triggering growing concerns as science progressively uncovers its deleterious potency and the nation\u2019s homes age. Thus, when extant, lead threats necessitate abatement or interim controls.\n\nLead inspections\n\nIn cities around the country, government agencies \u2014 some with federal funding \u2014 are implementing lead safety initiatives that often kick in when a child is poisoned. But aside from government-mandated efforts, owners of pre-1978 homes wary about lead should inspect for it.\n\n\u201cThe rule of thumb that we propose is in an older home, if the finishes look good, test for lead,\u201d said Erik Listou, industry instructor and co-founder of the Living In Place Institute. \u201cBecause lead is what kept them intact. It is metal; it doesn\u2019t degrade.\u201d\n\nAn EPA-certified lead inspector should carry out the examination, which utilizes an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) tool. Resembling a police radar gun, it detects lead in multiple layers of interior and exterior paint and on any stained features such as cabinets, doors and windows.\n\n\u201cI have inspected houses built in 1900 that still have the original lead-based paint,\u201d said John Burnside of Burnside Enterprises in Colorado. \u201cIt might be under two or three layers of paint, but it is still there after 120 years.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarning tape surrounds a home in Richmond as workers from Blake Contracting remove lead paint and make repairs. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nA check of 150 spots throughout Dragos\u2019s three-century-old property in Montgomery County produced 19 lead-positive results.\n\nWhile states may postulate disparate cut-off quantities, the Department of Housing and Urban Development denotes paint as lead-based if, per square centimeter, it bears 1 milligram or more of the metal.\n\nBut this divulges little about hazards. If chipping, flaking or peeling do not plague the paint, it is safe. If they do, harmful lead dust may settle in.\n\n\u201cWe worry about friction points creating lead-based dust,\u201d said John Overholser, building consultant and ancillary services manager with Top to Bottom Services in Gaithersburg, Md., which worked with Dragos. \u201cThe wood-framed windows that are painted. Doors that don\u2019t fit right and rub when you shut them. Railings that are getting rubbed down. Things like that can create that lead dust.\u201d\n\nLead dust requires a risk assessment with wipe samples, which Dragos opted for even though that type of analysis often pertains to documented cases of poisoning.\n\n\u201cI decided for my own peace of mind and having the true picture and reality of what I was dealing with, I would rather invest\u201d in it, she said, adding that the expense, at $565, depended on the number of swipes taken.\n\nThere are various lead-dust safety thresholds, taking into account the ways different spaces diverge in how susceptible they are to thorough cleaning and how accessible they are to kids. In June, the EPA and HUD tightened those, slashing contamination standards from 40 to 10 micrograms and from 250 to 100 micrograms of lead per square foot for floors and window sills, respectively.\n\n\n\nBlake Contracting owner Aaron Whitmore tests his air filter before assisting with the removal of lead paint. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nA Blake Contracting worker wearing protective gear scrapes lead paint from a home\u2019s exterior wall. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nLead inspections are costly, so home kits offer a substitute. While some contractors favor them to gauge the need for safeguards against lead, Michael Winn, owner of Winn Design + Build in Falls Church, Va., does not recommend home tests for lay use as they require the baring of every coat of paint.\n\n\u201cMost homeowners don\u2019t know to do that,\u201d Winn said. \u201cSo, they may feel like they don\u2019t have lead when they actually do.\u201d\n\nEven if done right, home kits only reveal the presence of lead, not its amount.\n\nLead remediation\n\nMost remediation work calls for EPA-licensed professionals and special permits \u2014 not only because of health perils but also because of the possibility of unintentionally spreading lead.\n\nYet if dust holds lead in lower amounts than the postulated levels, thorough and regular cleaning with wet towels and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuum usually tampers any danger.\n\n[Making the case for cottage neighborhoods]\n\nThis is the approach Mari Fontaine, president of New Hampshire-based Community Builders Construction, took when her family lived in a rental with lead. \u201cI just knew that we need to make sure that we didn\u2019t create any dust,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really kept it very, very clean.\u201d\n\n\n\nA homeowner\u2019s belongings are wrapped in plastic to protect them from lead paint dust and the new paint being applied. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nSpecialized cleaning represents one of the interim controls and \u201cis generally the most common, easiest and cheapest\u201d method to address lead hazards, said Brandon Colunga, senior project environmental specialist with the District\u2019s DMY Capitol.\n\nInterim controls are meant as temporary measures that demand periodic monitoring. They also include wet scraping \u2014 so that it doesn\u2019t create dust \u2014 of deteriorating paint and the blanketing of lead-tainted soil from an abraded exterior with mulch or gravel.\n\n\u201cIt is not total removal, but it is a fix that is acceptable,\u201d said Amin Abdullah, chief executive of Has Construction.\n\nTotal removal is what the Living In Place Institute\u2019s Listou prefers. Anything short of it is a Band-Aid, he said. But it could be quite a costly solution.\n\nLead projects can range from $3,000 to $10,000 depending on the amount of lead, the size of the affected area and the kind of remedy, among other variables. And, expenses may swell further with any renovations \u2014 new doors or a new lick of paint \u2014 warranted after the job.\n\n\u201cOur clients have always been a bit shocked by the cost of that,\u201d said Susan Isaacs, real estate agent with Compass\u2019s Isaacs Team in the District. \u201cI think for a lot of people, the removal and replacement is prohibitive.\u201d\n\nDespite the cost, Dragos plans to replace the lead-laced window. \u201cThat is going to be the biggest investment,\u201d she said, accenting her intention to also gradually take out the rest of the lead-bearing components throughout the Ashton property.\n\nShort of removal\n\nFor reasons beyond expense, removal is not always feasible. Historic neighborhoods, for example, may impose rules on what antique features are indispensable. In such instances, other abatement practices allow for what is deemed long-term prevention of hazardous exposure while keeping lead in place.\n\n[For some in 55-plus communities, townhouses with elevators meet all their needs]\n\nEncapsulation is one option. Sealing any withering paint, a lead encapsulant often also discourages kids from coming in contact with it. \u201cThe encapsulant a lot of times contains Bitrex, which is a bitter chemical that prevents the child from wanting to lick on the paint or chew on the paint,\u201d said Aaron Whitmore, owner of Richmond-based Blake Contracting.\n\n\n\nBlake Contracting\u2019s Aaron Whitmore checks the progress of work to remove lead paint from the home. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nAnother method is enclosure, or the covering of lead-bearing surfaces, including the construction of dry walls and the installation of carpets.\n\nDespite its scope, any lead abatement activity heeds stringent rules. A containment area \u2014 a plastic tent over the house when working on the exterior \u2014 needs to be constructed. Rigid removal procedures \u2014 sealing any waste and disposing of it in regulated landfills \u2014 must be followed. Meticulous cleaning should oust any gathered dust \u2014 a process that contractors repeat until a follow-up lead inspection indicates no lead hazards.\n\nHazards, though, can also lurk in a house\u2019s plumbing as pipes and fixtures used to be made of lead.\n\n\u201cLately, there has been a lot of focus on lead pipes and water contamination in lead pipes,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nOf the 105,000 private water service pipes in the District, about 7,500 are made of lead, according to a 2018 fiscal memorandum on the replacement of lead service lines. While the material of roughly 82,000 pipes is unknown, it is assumed to be lead for half of them.\n\nAny mitigation, however, may pose a challenge, especially so for service pipes, or those that carry water from a city\u2019s main to a property and lie on both public and private premises. Thus, the District has recently enacted a mandate that coordinates pipe replacements among owners.\n\nPipes might be hard to inspect and replace but lead-loaded water can be easily tested and filtered through a system affixed to the kitchen\u2019s faucet or at the start of an unleaded private service pipe.\n\nDragos\u2019s water proved free of lead. After a lab analysis, so did the soil.\n\nContent with the outcome, she said, \u201cmy advice is to just go ahead and invest in the [lead] tests so you know exactly what you are dealing with.\u201d\n\nTo see more photos, go to washingtonpost.com/realestate.", "description": "According to the EPA, nearly 90 percent of abodes constructed before 1940 nationwide are likely to have lead.", "authors": ["Dima Williams", "Photos Timothy C.
