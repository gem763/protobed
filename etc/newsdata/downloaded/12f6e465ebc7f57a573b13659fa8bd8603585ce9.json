Normani captivated the world with her \u201cMotivation\u201d video. Ally Brooke is heading to dominate Dancing With the Stars. And still in her \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d afterglow, Camila Cabello has dropped not one, but two songs from her upcoming album, Romance. For the purposes of this post and our little hearts, we will be pretending that every song is about Shawn Peter Raul Mendes. \u201cShameless\u201d is all about how she can\u2019t get her mind or hands off a certain someone. Very \u201cHands to Myself\u201d by Selena Gomez, but grittier with that trademark Camila Cabello voice. Then, there\u2019s \u201cLiar\u201d with a beat that basically requires a little hip shake. In an Instagram post, Camila welcomes fans to the world of Romance. It takes on a Roman aesthetic with soft colors, like it could be a scene in \u201cGod Is a Woman.\u201d With visuals like this, we\u2019re ready for a music video ASAP.", "description": "Camila Cabello\u2019s new songs \u201cShameless\u201d and \u201cLiar\u201d are the first two songs to introduce you to her new project, \u201cRomance.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/05/05-camila-cabello.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
