(AP) \u2014 Dozens of people trapped on a scuba diving boat that caught fire off the Southern California coast appear to have died from smoke inhalation, not burns, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe 34 people who died were sleeping in a cramped bunkroom below the main deck of the Conception when the fire broke out before dawn Monday and quickly engulfed the boat.\n\nPreliminary findings on the causes of death, announced by Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, raise the possibility the victims inhaled highly toxic smoke and died in their sleep before being scorched by flames that burned their bodies beyond recognition.\n\n\"The indicators are from the preliminary examination of the bodies that the victims died prior to being burned,\" Brown said.\n\nThe revelation came as investigators searched for the cause of the deadly blaze and divers looked for the body of the one missing victim. The Coast Guard said safety concerns over the weather halted efforts to salvage the boat Friday afternoon.\n\nWhile local, state and federal agencies try to solve the mystery of what doomed the dive boat, the investigation has not turned criminal, Brown said, though he said that was a possibility.\n\nUnder federal law known as the seaman's manslaughter statute, a captain or crew member can be charged with a crime if their negligence or misconduct results in death.\n\nLaurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at Loyola Law School, said it's too early to discuss charges.\n\n\"There are lots questions to answer, including what even constitutes negligence. In other words, do you have to have somebody on watch, enough fire extinguishers or ways to, you know, get out \u2014 enough exits?\" Levenson said. \"Certainly, if they find out there was negligence or misconduct this is a possibility, but it's too soon.\"\n\nTwenty-three of the 33 bodies recovered have been positively identified through DNA, and their family members around the world are being notified, Brown said. Relatives have been tracked down as far away as Singapore, Japan and India.\n\nBrown said the cause and manner of death was being determined through external exams and not traditional autopsies. Final results will depend on toxicology tests.\n\nDr. Howard Robin, an expert in forensic pathology, said it's hard to know how the people died without an autopsy but said it's possible they died in their sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n\"You don't know if they suffered or not,\" Robin said. \"I would think if there's a fire and they were breathing in the carbon monoxide, there would soot, and then there would be a cough and ... then they would wake up.\"\n\nRobin said the lack of autopsies could present a challenge during any lawsuits brought by family members because those results are typically used to support damages for pain and suffering.\n\nThe owner of the boat, Truth Aquatics Inc., pre-emptively filed a lawsuit Thursday under a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law that could protect it from potentially costly payouts to families of the dead, a move condemned by some observers as disrespectful and callous.\n\nThe company said in a statement posted Friday on Instagram that the lawsuit is an \"unfortunate side of these tragedies\" and pinned the action on insurance companies and other so-called stakeholders.\n\n\"This wouldn't be something that we as a family would even consider,\" Truth Aquatics said. \"The timing is on them. Our hearts and minds are on the tragedy and finding answers.\"\n\nCoast Guard records show the boat passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. And previous customers said Truth Aquatics and the captains of its three boats were very safety conscious.\n\nFive crew members jumped overboard after trying to rescue the 33 scuba divers and one crew member whose escape routes were blocked by fire, federal authorities and the boat's owner said. The crew, including the captain, said they were driven back by flames, smoke and heat.\n\nThey jumped from the bridge area to the main deck \u2014 one breaking a leg in the effort \u2014 and tried to get through the double doors of the galley, which were on fire.\n\nThat cut off both escape routes from the sleeping quarters: a stairway and an escape hatch that exited in the galley area. The crew then tried, but failed, to get into windows at the front of the vessel.", "description": "Dozens of people trapped on a scuba diving boat that caught fire off the Southern California coast appear to have died from smoke inhalation, not burns, authorities said Friday.
