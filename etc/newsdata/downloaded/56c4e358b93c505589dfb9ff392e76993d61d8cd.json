Its report, produced with the help of Moody\u2019s Analytics, helps evaluate the health of the U.S. labor market.\n\nWhat happened: Big companies added 67,000 jobs, mid-sized firms hired 39,000 new workers and small businesses filled 30,000 positions.\n\nHealth care led the way, as it often has, by creating 35,000 new jobs. An aging population requires more doctors and caregivers.\n\nTrade and transportations jobs increased by 28,000 while professional and business services hired 20,000 people.\n\nConstruction firms filled 9,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment barely rose.\n\nThe ADP employment figures tend to track the government\u2019s official jobs estimate over time, but they can vary widely from month to month. The government\u2019s report, which also includes government workers, comes out Friday. Economists polled by MarketWatch predict a 147,000 increase.\n\nRead: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since Great Recession, ISM finds\n\nAnd: Manufacturing slump could still hurt the broader economy, but not trigger a recession\n\nBig picture: Hiring in the U.S. has tapered off since the end of 2018. There\u2019s even been reports that some companies are reducing employment for the first time in years, though so far these job cuts have not shown up in the weekly tally of Americans applying for unemployment benefits.\n\nEconomists predict job creation will continue to slow owing to the ongoing trade war with China that has damaged the global economy and boomeranged on the U.S. Manufacturers and exporters have been particularly hard hit.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.28% and S&P 500 SPX, -1.23% were set to open lower in Wednesday trades. The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% fell to 1.64%.", "description": "The nation\u2019s businesses added a modest 135,000 private-sector jobs in September, ADP said, in another sign that hiring is slowing along with the broader U.S....", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS434_hiring_ZG_20191001162415.jpg"}
