There have been questions about the lack of considerable blood on the crash scene.\n\nThe lack of marks on the road could also indicate that Watson was not pushed or did not swerve off the road, News24 understands.\n\nThe expert added that while there are no CCTV cameras on the site of the crash, there would be footage of the highway leading up to it. This, they said, the police should already have.\n\nNews24 also understands that there are two other investigations into the crash, including one allegedly by Toyota and another by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nRTMC confirmed that it had already sent a report to the South African Police Service.\n\n\"We assisted the police at their request and a report was given to them,\" Simon Zwane, spokesperson for the RTMC, told News24.\n\nToyota, however, refused to comment on the matter \"as it is under police investigation\".\n\nAccording to the expert, if a car has airbags as Watson's car did, there should be an event data recorder (EDR) in the car.\n\nWhen the airbags deploy, this triggers the EDR which starts recording pre- and post-crash data on the car.\n\nThe EDR is essentially a \"black box\" that records speed, acceleration, braking and steering action in the car.\n\nWhile Toyota said it does not look into every crash that happens, the EDR in Watson's car should have vital information regarding the crash.\n\n'Eyewitnesses lying'\n\nAccording to Jared Watson, the crash report confirms that \"eyewitnesses were lying\".\n\nOne person who claiming to be an eyewitnesses told News24 they saw Watson's car stopped on the side of the highway with its hazards on before driving back on to the road.\n\nOnce his car was back on the road, Watson sped up, passing the witness at high speed and eventually collided with the concrete pillar approaching the airport.\n\nALSO READ | Gavin Watson was 'already dead' at time of crash - report\n\nThe vehicle collided with the pillar of a bridge at a speed that \"was definitely above 100km/h\" because of the nature of the impact and noise thereafter.\n\n\"The car, after the collision, instantly faced sideways and was [smoking] but we could not go check because of my flight time,\" the witness said.\n\nJared Watson, however, told News24: \"The cops themselves say they have now not been able to track down these 'witnesses' which is very strange.\"\n\nThe police were asked for comment, but had not done so by the time of publication.", "description": "A preliminary report completed by a private investigator hired to look into Bosasa boss Gavin Watson\u2019s car crash has found that there was no significant acceleration for around five seconds before he hit a concrete pillar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8823/5417cb06c3d54163aa9eaa067a5f26f7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
