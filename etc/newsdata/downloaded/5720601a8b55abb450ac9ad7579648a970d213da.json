Then came reports that may have chilled early stage investors: the biggest stakeholder in the office space group, VisionFund, controlled by Japan\u2019s Softbank, was pushing WeWork management to shelve the listing as the almost unanimous criticism began to weigh on WeWork's (NYSE: ) potential market valuation.\n\nFrom a sum as high as $65bn reportedly projected by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) whilst pitching to be the bookrunner, Friday reports suggest the market capitalisation could now start as low as $10bn. And that\u2019s after founder Adam Neumann offered concessions to get the deal across the line.\n\nAn outside chance remains that the debut could yet be postponed. Softbank\u2019s VisionFund has invested in the group at far higher valuations currently being discussed. Also, the two banks handling the IPO, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Goldman have publicly signalled concerns about an IPO valuing We anywhere below $15bn\n\nStill, WeWork\u2019s prospects of coming to market look to have rebounded. Not least because SoftBank (T: ) has now signalled that it could double down on its investment by purchasing at least $750m of the stock at IPO. Shares in We Co., the group\u2019s official name, are expected to be marketed to investors next week. They could then be listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange during the week beginning 23rd September, according to news reports.\n\nHere are some key points\n\nVoting shares: We Co. initially adopted a custom often deployed by techy companies by setting share terms that would enable founders, including Adam Neumann, to keep a tight grip on control. In an updated prospectus out on Friday, We now says that \u2018high-vote\u2019 stock will now only have 10 votes, instead of 20 previously. However, We is keeping proposals to offer three classes of stock that continue to leave the majority of votes with Neumann\n\nWe Co. initially adopted a custom often deployed by techy companies by setting share terms that would enable founders, including Adam Neumann, to keep a tight grip on control.

However, We is keeping proposals to offer three classes of stock that continue to leave the majority of votes with Neumann Governance concerns : We has also proposed major changes to its board structure after Wall Street attacked unconventional plans to, for instance, include Neumann\u2019s wife as a board member, apparently not for reasons connected to expertise in WeWork\u2019s core business. We Co. now pledges that no member of Neumann\u2019s family will have a board seat. With a weaker ability to fill the board with pliable directors, We\u2019s board may be sufficiently independent to enforce a switch from the pursuit of growth in favour of profitability which founders have said is We Co\u2019s ultimate aim\n\n: We has also proposed major changes to its board structure after Wall Street attacked unconventional plans to, for instance, include Neumann\u2019s wife as a board member, apparently not for reasons connected to expertise in WeWork\u2019s core business.

However We appears to be briefing widely that it now expects to seek a valuation of between $10bn-$12bn. That\u2019s a humiliating climb down relative to earlier values. It also suggests a measure of desperation to get the IPO done. It\u2019s worth remembering that what was meant to be one of the group\u2019s final finance deals before launching on the stock market predicated as much as $10bn in additional funding, should We conclude its IPO\n\nThere is no clear comment about valuation in the group\u2019s latest filing.

Some of the most controversial points are as follows.\n\nNeumann transactions - We Co. lent Neumann multimillion-dollar amounts intended for property acquisitions, followed by sale and leaseback deals in favour of Neumann. We now says Neumann will return any profits from such transactions to the company. $50bn is payable to entities controlled by Neumann in coming years.\n\nCash-burn: $2.2bn was toasted last year. The group has disclosed that it lost $2.9bn over three years and $690m in the first half of 2019.\n\nRevenues: We Co. generated $1.8bn in 2018 compared to $886m a year before.", "description": "Shares Analysis by City Index (Ken Odeluga) covering: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, SoftBank Corp, WeWork.
