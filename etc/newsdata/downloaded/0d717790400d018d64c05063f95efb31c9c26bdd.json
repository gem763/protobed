They\u2019ve always asked what we thought about the track once we\u2019re in the car. So, yeah, happy. We'll see,\u201d added the 21-year-old Monegasque.\n\nFormula One is no stranger to dealing with inclement weather in Japan. In 2004 Typhoon Ma-on forced qualifying to be postponed to Sunday. Another storm in 2010 at Suzuka and in 2015 at the U.S. Grand Prix similarly delayed qualifying by a day.\n\nAll track running for the local Formula Four support category has been canceled for the weekend, allowing Formula One more flexibility in planning its schedule if needed.\n\n\u201cThere is a forecast, but how many times have forecasts changed?\u201d said Ferrari\u2019s four-time champion Sebastian Vettel.\n\n\u201cCurrently it sits at a 100% so it\u2019s quite clear.\n\n\u201cIt would make sense if by tomorrow (Friday) at night, there is more evidence to give a proposal, or take an action for Saturday.\u201d\n\nFive times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who leads Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas by 73 points in the overall standings with five races left, said he was sure organizers were prepared.\n\n\u201cI think they do the utmost they can. I\u2019m sure they already have procedures in place to move it (qualifying) to the Sunday morning.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Peter Rutherford and Ken Ferris)", "description": "SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Formula One drivers at this weekend\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix said they trust race organizers to make the right call regarding any changes to the event schedule, with Typhoon Hagibis threatening to disrupt Saturday\u2019s qualifying session at Suzuka.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
