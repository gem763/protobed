Local governments, hospitals and tribes have filed nearly 2,000 similar lawsuits \u2014 many of which have been tied together \u2014 challenging pharmaceutical companies over their alleged roles in flooding the country with powerful prescription painkillers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCleveland County District Court Judge Thad Balkman on Monday ruled Johnson & Johnson aggressively marketed opioids and promoted misleading medical claims that underplayed the drugs\u2019 addiction risk.\n\n\"Defendants caused an opioid crisis that is evidenced by increased rates of addiction, overdose deaths and neonatal abstinence syndrome,\" Balkman said.\n\nThe damages appeared to be smaller than Wall Street was expecting, as stocks of companies involved in opioid litigation spiked upward after the ruling. Wells Fargo analysts earlier said they believed Johnson & Johnson could have faced a payout of more than $2 billion in the Oklahoma lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThis is not the eye-popping result that some people expected it to be,\u201d said Andrew Pollis, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, who has tracked the opioid litigation closely.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The judge for over a year has been pushing for a nationwide settlement that experts believe could be the biggest since tobacco companies agreed to pay $250 billion two decades ago. The first of those trials is scheduled to begin this fall.\n\nHowever, the Oklahoma lawsuit may be an imperfect bellwether for those cases, largely because the highest-profile opioid maker, Purdue Pharma, wasn\u2019t on trial. In addition, the state's \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d statute that Oklahoma relied on to make its case won\u2019t be relevant to the proceedings in Ohio.\n\nOklahoma originally named Purdue and Teva Pharmaceuticals in the same litigation. Before the case went to trial, Oklahoma settled with Purdue for $270 million in March, partially because the state feared the drugmaker would declare bankruptcy and avoid paying anything. Oklahoma also reached an $85 million settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals days before the trial started in May.\n\nThat left Johnson & Johnson as the lone defendant. Oklahoma\u2019s attorneys portrayed the pharmaceutical giant as the \u201ckingpin\u201d of the opioid epidemic during the seven-week trial. They argued that Johnson & Johnson, through its subsidiaries, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, supplied much of the raw material that other drugmakers relied on to hook millions of Americans onto pain pills. They said the state would need as much as $17.8 billion over the next 30 years to address fallout from the addiction crisis.\n\nJohnson & Johnson, which on Monday said it would appeal the ruling, vigorously denied Oklahoma\u2019s claims and accused it of trying to scapegoat the company for a public health disaster it wasn\u2019t responsible for creating. The company\u2019s attorneys also suggested that Oklahoma officials were asleep at the switch as the crisis mounted and failed to take action.\n\n\u201cJanssen did not cause the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, and neither the facts nor the law support this outcome,\u201d said Michael Ullmann, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s general counsel, in a statement.\n\nBrianna Ehley contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The closely watched ruling in Oklahoma will likely have implications for a wave of similar lawsuits.", "authors": ["Paul Demko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/27/f9/615fc7fe4e89968450d05e040c11/190826-johnson-johnson-gty-773.jpg"}
