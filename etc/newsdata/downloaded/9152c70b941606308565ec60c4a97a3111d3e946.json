On balance, the nods and winks on the trade talks in Washington have been read as marginally positive \u2013 or at least when combined with fairly clear signalling from the Federal Reserve that it\u2019s about to ease policy again later this month.\n\nA Union Jack flag is seen during a plenary session on preparations for the next EU leaders' summit, at the European Parliament in Brussels, October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nToday\u2019s U.S. consumer price inflation numbers are unlikely to provide any obstacle to that easing if the soft September producer price report seen earlier in the week is any guide. Perhaps the main mover overnight was a rally in China\u2019s offshore yuan, which strengthened to its best levels in more than two weeks after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. and Chinese officials were reviving a currency pact first mooted earlier this year that stops further tariff hikes in return for commitments to hold the yuan stable.\n\nOther reports suggest President Trump will cede some ground on U.S. company dealings with Chinese tech giant Huawei. On the other hand, there were Chinese press reports that Vice Premier Liu was due to leave the talks a day early and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ross insisted overnight that tariff rises on Chinese goods were working and having the desired effect of drawing trade concessions from Beijing. If there\u2019s not sufficient progress in this week\u2019s talks U.S. tariffs on some $250 billion of Chinese goods rise to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.\n\nWall St\u2019s S&P500 gained almost 1 percent late on Wednesday, with futures flat first thing on Thursday. Asia\u2019s main bourses were mostly higher, with Shanghai leading the way with gains of 0.7%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was up 0.5% and Hong Kong rose 0.3%. Seoul\u2019s Kospi bucked the trend and dropped 0.8%. Even though euro stock futures were up marginally first thing, European markets were digesting another round of dour industrial numbers. German exports fell more than expected in August and French industrial production also surprised with an unexpected drop of 0.9% during the month.\n\nThere was also attention on what\u2019s seen as an internal battle brewing within the European Central Bank over whether it should be easing monetary policy even further. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that outgoing ECB chief Draghi ignored advice from the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee not to resume bond purchases, shedding light on how divisive the move has proven. Minutes of the ECB\u2019s latest policy meeting are released later on Thursday. Euro/dollar strengthened above $1.10 first thing. Sterling was more mixed, weakening further against the euro but steady against the dollar.\n\nMuch like the U.S.-China trade talks, the Brexit impasse is now the subject of claim and counter-claim, sketchy press reports and denials. UK PM Johnson meets Irish PM Varadkar near Liverpool later on Thursday to see if there\u2019s any chance of a breakthrough that would see a deal by next week\u2019s EU summit. This week\u2019s compromise proposals from London have effectively been rejected by Brussels. If there\u2019s no deal, Johnson is legally obliged to seek an extension of the Oct 31 Brexit date even though he continues to insist he will not do so.\n\nElsewhere, Turkey\u2019s lira steadied after sliding to its weakest level since June on Wednesday as Turkish troops launched a military offensive against Kurdish forces in Northern Syria. The lira and Turkish bonds were hit after U.S. Senators unveiled a proposal for sanctions against Turkey for its military operation unless certain conditions were met.\n\nOn the European corporate front, Paris stock futures are outperforming after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH\u2019s solid Q3 print despite HK unrest. Upbeat results from LVMH is likely to trigger a rally as analysts were largely expecting luxury companies to take a major hit from political protests in HK. LVMH is seen rising 4%, while its rivals Richemont, Swatch, Kering and Hermes are seen up 2%, according to premarket indications from traders.\n\nDutch health tech company Philips is seen falling 4% to 5% after it said trade tariffs and disappointing results at its Connected Care division would make it impossible to reach its target for profit margin improvement this year. In other earnings-based moves, UK packaging and paper company Mondi is seen down 3% to 5% after reporting slightly lower sales volumes; Novozymes is called -5% after profit warning; UK\u2019s plus-sized fashion retailer N Brown seen up 5% on H1 profit beat.\n\n\u2014 A look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
