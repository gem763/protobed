Biden in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, but first he wants more clarity on whether his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine were \u201con the up-and-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a voter, that is a concern,\u201d said Mr. French, 61. \u201cRight now, there is a shadow cast over Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe Bidens\u2019 history in Ukraine is getting another look in the aftermath of a whistleblower complaint accusing President Trump of using threats to cut off U.S. military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and the son\u2019s profitable business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump has launched a counteroffensive denying any quid pro quo. He said investigators would be better served looking into whether Mr. Biden, as vice president, sought the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was looking into corruption at the country\u2019s largest private gas company, Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board and reportedly raked in $50,000 per month.\n\nVoters in New Hampshire are now trying to sort out who is telling the truth and whether the former vice president and his son were involved in shady business dealings as they consider their options in the 2020 primary race.\n\nMr. Biden maintains the prosecutor lost his job because he dropped the ball when it came to combating Ukraine\u2019s \u201ccancer of corruption.\u201d Mr. Biden last year boasted that his threat to withhold $1 billion in aid led to the prosecutor\u2019s ultimate dismissal.\n\nHe described Mr. Trump\u2019s account as \u201cbizarre.\u201d He said the storyline has been debunked by every \u201ccredible journalist\u201d and that it is a blatant attempt to divert attention away from what he called the president\u2019s unhinged and dangerous behavior.\n\n\u201cIt is such a blatant abuse of power, I don\u2019t think it can stand,\u201d Mr. Biden said this week on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d where he moved a step closer to backing the impeachment push on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe dueling versions of events date back to 2014 when Mr. Biden became the Obama administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine after the country\u2019s president was ousted in a revolution. Weeks later, Hunter Biden landed his plum job on the board at Burisma.\n\nThe political dust-up has created an opening for some of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals in the 2020 presidential primary. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has sprinted past Mr. Biden in early primary state polls, has made ferreting out corruption the centerpiece of her campaign.\n\nMs. Warren used her opening this week when reporters asked whether she would allow the child of her vice president to serve on the board of a foreign company.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat told reporters at a campaign stop in Keene before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019d have to go back and look at the details.\u201d\n\nHer campaign later clarified to The Washington Post that ethics proposals Ms. Warren has introduced don\u2019t prevent children of a vice president from serving on a company\u2019s board.\n\nFord O\u2019Connell, a Republican Party strategist with close ties to the White House, said the episode is playing in Ms. Warren\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cIf you are Elizabeth Warren, you have to be giddy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWhile defending him to the teeth, you\u2019re hoping it sinks him.\u201d\n\nOther voters say Hunter Biden, who had no previous experience in the energy sector, probably benefited from his father\u2019s political clout, but they don\u2019t think he broke any laws and they don\u2019t think it will dent Mr. Biden\u2019s chances in the primary race.\n\nMichael Clark said Mr. Biden has a \u201cgood rapport\u201d with voters in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI would back him,\u201d the 65-year-old said. \u201cI like Joe Biden. I think he is a good man, and he is a fair guy, I believe.\u201d\n\nMr. French, meanwhile, said he isn\u2019t writing off Mr. Biden but will remain on the fence until he learns more \u2014 including how Hunter Biden landed his cushy job, what sort of role Mr. Biden played in securing the post and whether he did anything for the money he received.\n\n\u201cIf there is an investigation, I want to see what they come up with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2981 David Sherfinski contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
