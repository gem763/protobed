They can be thrilling, especially when you\u2019re competing against others. They involve lots of skill, and offer a chance to switch off from the pressures of real life. But imagine if your gaming talents could actually be put to use in the real world? Well, now businesses are waking up to the skills gamers can bring to the workplace.\n\nAs an example, the BBC spoke to trainee surgeon Saied Froghi. He played video games like Age of Empires and Halo in his spare time when he was at medical school. But this relaxing pastime wasn\u2019t distracting him from his studies - he thinks his time in front of a screen actually helped his surgery skills. He claims it helped him with his concentration, and he compares some of the skills used in keyhole surgery with using a games console. He says \u201cYour hands know where the buttons are and how to rotate the instrument.\u201d\n\nCertainly, operating gaming controls help to develop good hand-eye coordination, but there are other abilities you can learn which can be applied to real-life work situations. Start-up company Game Academy told the BBC\u2019s David Molloy that some games involve strategy and resource management, which are good skills for management. It analyses gamers' habits from their online gaming profile and offers courses in valuable skills that reflect their aptitudes. These are skills that can be developed, and if carefully reworded, can be added to CVs.\n\nEmployers might still need convincing that gamers are not just teenagers wasting their time in their bedrooms without thinking about their career prospects. But business consultant Mia Bennett told the BBC that gaming can help skills like \"decision-making, the ability to anticipate and scenario planning\u2026 It also helps with meta-skills - learning how to learn, experimentation, and creative thinking.\"\n\nYou might think that the idea of gaming developing transferable skills is like the games themselves \u2013 pure fantasy \u2013 and a gamer doesn\u2019t want to associate the fun and escapism it provides with work. It certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee you a good job, and you need to be an accomplished gamer for your skills to shine. But if so much time is being spent gripped by the challenge of Portal or the strategy of Civilization, why not put those talents to good use?\n\n\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\n\nthrilling \u60ca\u9669\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\n\nswitch off \u4e0d\u518d\u64cd\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u7406\u776c\n\ntalent \u5929\u5206\uff0c\u5929\u8d4b\n\ndistract \u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5fc3\n\nconcentration \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\n\nconsole \u6e38\u620f\u673a\n\ngaming controls \u6e38\u620f\u673a\u624b\u67c4\n\nhand-eye coordination \u624b\u773c\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\n\nstrategy \u6218\u7565\uff0c\u7b56\u5212\n\ngamer \u73a9\u5bb6\n\nresource management \u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\n\nprofile \uff08\u73a9\u5bb6\uff09\u7b80\u4ecb\n\naptitude \u5929\u8d44\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\n\nprospect \u524d\u666f\n\ndecision-making \u51b3\u7b56\n\nanticipate \u9884\u8ba1\u3001\u9884\u6599\n\nscenario planning \u60c5\u666f\u89c4\u5212\n\nmeta-skill \u201c\u8d85\u6280\u80fd\u201d\uff0c\u6307\u5e2e\u52a9\u81ea\u4e3b\u57f9\u517b\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u5176\u5b83\u5177\u4f53\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u8fdb\u9636\u80fd\u529b\n\ntransferable skill \u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6280\u80fd\n\nfantasy \u5e7b\u60f3\n\naccomplished \u6280\u827a\u9ad8\u8d85\u7684\n\ngripped \u5165\u8ff7\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u62d4\u7684\n\n\u6d4b\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ec3\u4e60\n\n1. \u9605\u8bfb\u8bfe\u6587\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n1.
