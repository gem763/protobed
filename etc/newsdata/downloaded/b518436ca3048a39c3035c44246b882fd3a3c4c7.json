There was a lot of running. But it's always easier to play at home, I was energised.\"\n\nFederer will be in uncharted territory in the final with De Minaur, who has won trophies this season in Sydney, Atlanta and Zhuhai.\n\n\"He's one of the fastest players,\" Federer said. \"I'm very excited to be in the final again. I was not sure how it would go this week, so I'm really happy.\"\n\nThe 28th-ranked De Minaur, who trains and lives in Spain, is the first Australian to reach the Basel final since Mark Philippoussis finished runner-up in 1997.\n\nDe Minaur, who measures up at 1.80 meters compared to Opelka's towering 2.11 meters, set up his semifinal victory with a passing winner for four match points.\n\nOpelka saved the first with an ace but was caught out on the second as his opponent sealed the win.\n\n\"Nothing can prepare you for that serve,\" de Minaur said.\n\n\"Reilly's an incredibly tough competitor who never gives up. I'm just happy to be in the final. I guessed right a few times and got lucky. I was just lucky to have gone the right direction, I was just hoping not be hit by any of those serves.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Roger Federer extended his Swiss Indoors win streak to 23 matches as he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday to reach the final for the 15th time, racking up his 50th win of 2019.
