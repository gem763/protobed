The Khurais oil field, one of the kingdom\u2019s largest, resumed 30% of production within 24 hours of the strikes and will be totally back online by September\u2019s end, Mr. Abdulkareem said.\n\nSaudi Arabia invited reporters to see the damaged oil facilities to show customers Aramco was back in business and to help Washington rally international support against Iran ahead of a meeting next week of world leaders at the United Nations.\n\nBoth the kingdom and the U.S. have accused Tehran of orchestrating the strikes on Khurais and on a Saudi crude processing facility that is the world\u2019s largest, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo describing the strikes as an \u201cact of war.\u201d Iran has denied involvement.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe gathering at the U.N.\u2019s General Assembly in New York, including President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, could provide a critical forum in determining the next developments in the crisis.\n\nAramco officials escorted journalists to Khurais, about 125 miles east of the capital Riyadh, where the significant damage suggested the strikes were orchestrated with a high degree of accuracy and planning.\n\nFour cruise missiles had hit the facility, say Saudi officials, and targeted the oil field\u2019s crucial processing unit, or stabilization towers, which extract crude from the ground and process it to create export products.\n\nRelated Video An attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities has led to an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. While Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are pointing to evidence Iran was involved. Here's what we know so far.\n\nAramco also granted access to its seven-million-barrel-a-day, oil-processing site at Abqaiq, which lies north of the Empty Quarter, a 250,000-square-mile expanse that is one of the biggest continuous deserts in the world. Officials said it took about seven hours to douse the fires there after the attack.\n\nLike in Khurais, hundreds of workers were repairing facilities across the Abqaiq site. Aramco said projectiles hit 11 spherical structures, known as spheroids, used to separate gas from oil before further processing. Scaffolding surrounded a few of the structures that were undergoing work. Officials displayed a metal sheet with a roughly 4-foot wide hole where the company said a projectile hit. The oil company said it hoped to regain lost production by the end of the month.\n\nMr. Abdulkareem said Aramco has begun importing equipment from the U.S. and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities.\n\nIn total, the Saudi military has said 25 missiles and drones were launched against both Khurais and Abqaiq. Some 18 of those drones hit Abqaiq, with three cruise missiles failing to strike directly, according to the Saudi military. Four missiles hit Khurais.\n\nRiyadh asked the U.N. to send experts to investigate the attacks, as it pushes to hold Iran responsible for what it called an \u201cassault on the international community.\u201d The investigation is ongoing, a U.N. official said.\n\nMembers of the media film and photograph a destroyed section of an installation at Khurais on Friday.

Mr. Macron will then meet Mr. Trump on Sunday or Monday. The French president also expects to have a bilateral meeting with Mr. Rouhani, the aide said.\n\nAny Saudi military retaliation against Iran would raise the risk of a broader conflict. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has said a military strike by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia against his country would result in \u201can all-out war.\u201d\n\nOther Iranian officials issued bellicose rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIf the Americans think about a plot, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean,\u201d Yahya Rahim Safavi, a senior aide to the Supreme Leader, said in a speech quoted by the ISNA news agency. He called Iran \u201cinvincible.\u201d\n\nAhmad Alamolhoda, an influential Friday prayer leader in Mashhad in northeast Iran, said Iran\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance\u201d encompassed groups in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. \u201cThat means if you want to attack, Israel will be leveled to the ground in half a day,\u201d he said in his sermon Friday, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.\n\nTensions between Iran and the U.S. have escalated after Washington pulled out of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal last year and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Tehran. The U.S. has accused Iran of orchestrating attacks on six tankers off its southern coast earlier this year, which Tehran denied. Iran also captured a British-flagged vessel in the Persian Gulf after U.K. forces detained an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar.\n\nSaudi officials have concluded that Iran or one of its proxies launched the complex assault involving drones and cruise missiles from a location north of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe kingdom made its judgment based on the direction of the cruise missiles when they struck the facilities and the range of the weapons. Weapons found at the two attack sites also could be traced back to Iran, Saudi Arabia has said.\n\nAlso Friday, the Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen launched strikes against the Iran-backed group near the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. The Houthis have claimed last weekend\u2019s attacks in Saudi Arabia, but U.S. and Saudi official say the claim is implausible.\n\nThe coalition destroyed four sites used by the Houthis to store mines and an explosives-laden boat in the Red Sea, the coalition spokesman said in a statement. The spokesman said the operation abided by international law, but the Houthis said it breached an U.N.-brokered cease-fire deal for Hodeidah struck between the rebels and the Yemeni government in Sweden late last year. Iranian state media also called the assault a violation of that pact.\n\nSince the cease-fire deal, both sides have engaged in skirmishes in and around Hodeidah but have made no concerted push to capture new territory. The U.N., which oversees the agreement, hasn\u2019t considered the breaches serious enough to intervene.\n\nLate on Friday, the Houthis declared a unilateral cease fire, saying they would halt all drone and missile strikes into Saudi Arabia, if the Saudi-led coalition reciprocated.\n\nIn a speech broadcast on the Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah television channel, Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, also said the rebels would unveil advanced antiaircraft weapons and missiles in the coming days.\n\nMartin Griffiths, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen, flew from Washington to the region on Friday to discuss the issue with Houthi leaders, according to people familiar with the talks. Houthi leaders have made similar proposals in the past, they said, and they said this proposal would be different only if Saudi Arabia agreed to stop shooting.\n\n\u2014Sune Engel Rasmussen and Dion Nissenbaum in Beirut, Aresu Eqbali in Tehran and Noemie Bisserbe in Paris contributed to this article.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nOn Friday, Saudi officials escorted journalists to the Khurais oil field about 125 miles east of the capital Riyadh. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the oil field was west of the capital.
