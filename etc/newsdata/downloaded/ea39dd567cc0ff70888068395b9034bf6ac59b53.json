More electric, swirling, heart-in-mouth rugby. More absorbing drama. Regardless of what comes next for Japan, regardless of how far they go on home soil, the host nation has thrilled in abundance, creating not one but now two sporting spectacles that have reaffirmed their status as the new kids on the block.\n\nThis particular night will live long in the memory, even with the dizzying delight of that iconic win over Ireland fresh in the mind. Against a Samoan side that dipped in and out of this match, their presence fading and then reappearing as the evening dragged on, Japan delivered a performance that has become typical of them to win 38-19 here in Toyota, securing a crucial bonus point in the process.\n\nThe usual suspects were up to their old tricks. Kotaro Matsushima and Lomano Lemeki, the lightening boys out on the flanks, punishing the Samoans with their breathless and penetrative running. Veteran Michael Leitch, his face and hands in the dirt, rummaging around for possession, a thief in the night stealing what he can. Yu Tamura, calm, collected, setting about his business with near-perfect efficiency, kicking the penalties of the first half before adding the extras on all but one of his side\u2019s tries.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd then there was the home crowd. Riotous and raucous as ever, providing a backtrack of gasps, cheers and thunderous support that never subsided. When Kazuki Himeno grounded Japan\u2019s second of the night \u2013 a crucial score that came 15 minutes after the break to place the hosts back on the ascendancy \u2013 you could feel the home faithful sucking in the rolling maul that had formed off Samoa\u2019s line, willing and roaring the Brave Blossoms forward.\n\nBut for an evening that ended in such captivating fashion \u2013 Matsushima diving over with 88 minutes on the board to make sure of the bonus point \u2013 it was one that had started in tentative, steady fashion. Tamura and Samoa\u2019s Henry Taefu exchanged a flurry of penalties, taking the score to 9-6 on 29 minutes as Japan probed but struggled to find a way through.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8. Michael Leitch (Japan) Another substitute who made such a strong contribution to a winning cause. Leitch came on after the half-hour mark to replace Amanaki Mafi and lead by example, setting the tone for Japan\u2019s latest great upset. EPA 9/15 9. Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power.

Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) The only man to retain his spot in the side after yet another strong showing in Shizuoka, Matsushima is establishing himself as one of the must-watch players at the World Cup.

AP\n\nBut then, a breakthrough at last, Timothy Lafaele bursting through the blue wall to finally bring a sense of purpose and direction to his side\u2019s efforts.\n\nHimeno\u2019s second-half effort restored Japan\u2019s growing momentum, after a period of stubborn resistance from Samoa, but it wasn\u2019t to be the moment that settled this game. The Pacific Islanders had other ideas, with Taefu reaping the rewards of his forwards\u2019 draining efforts in the closing 10 minutes of the match.\n\nThe crowd sensed an upset but Jamie Joseph\u2019s men maintained their steel-like focus to immediately hit back. Off more clinical transition play, turning defence to attack, Japan found their third try as Kenki Fukuoka rounded a scrambled wall of Samoans to dot down.\n\nThen, the thrilling denouement to the evening. Samoa\u2019s decision to scrum again on their own line, with the clock on 86 minutes, may well be the moment that decides the fate of either Ireland or Scotland at this World Cup.\n\nWith the prospect of a fourth try in reaching distance, the Japanese clinched the penalty, overwhelming their opponents with a thumping forward shunt. What followed was inevitable. After the put-in, the ball was fizzed left for Matsushima to spark hysteria and, more importantly, place one foot firmly in the quarter-finals.", "description": "More unbending, unrelenting self-belief.
