Acting on an email from someone posing as city manager Steve Kanellakos, Simulik wired $97,797.20 US \u2014 currently worth about $130,000 Cdn \u2014 to a U.S. bank account.\n\nCity solicitor Rick O'Connor identified Lewis as the culprit in April after the incident was made public in a city auditor's report.\n\nScammers laundered $3M US\n\nLewis and his co-conspirators also sent fake emails and invoices to a power company in Ohio and a trucking company in Tennessee, directing them to make payments to various bank accounts through wire transfers, according to Florida prosecutors.\n\nThe scam laundered approximately $3 million US in less than one year, according to the investigation involving the FBI and U.S. Secret Service in Florida.\n\nLewis kept $160,000 USD in cash for himself, and acquired a Porsche, which law enforcement officials later seized.\n\nClaimed he was a 'money mule'\n\nIn April, Lewis told CBC the accusations against him were \"mind-blowing,\" claiming he was innocent and had been unwittingly used by the scammers.\n\n\"I wasn't involved in ripping off the City of Ottawa. That's, like, ridiculous,\" Lewis said. \"I'm a victim in this, and they call what I did a 'money mule.'\"\n\nThe scam perpetrated on the city treasurer is known as \"whaling\" because it targets big fish such as CEOs and chief financial officers of major corporations, including municipalities.\n\nIn July 2018, Simulik received a fake email asking her to pay a city IT supplier, which she assumed had something to do with an overhaul of the ottawa.ca website. After a few emails back and forth, she authorized and sent the requested amount to a U.S. bank account.\n\nLewis is expected to be sentenced on Jan. 10, and could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the 11 counts he was convicted on.", "description": "A Florida man accused of defrauding the City of Ottawa out of\u00a0more than $100,000 has been found guilty by a U.S. judge.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5092924.1571159883!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/elvin-lewis-jr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
