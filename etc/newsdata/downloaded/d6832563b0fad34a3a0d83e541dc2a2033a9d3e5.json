If it's properly implemented, by all means,\" he said.\n\n\"Afrikaans is the biggest language in the Western Cape. Our primary argument was [that] there are already four universities in the Western Cape, three of which are English completely. The way it's going to go on the implementation of Stellenbosch, that's also going to become English and that's probably why we are so disappointed,\" Rossouw said.\n\nInclusive policy\n\nFroneman, however, said the policy was more inclusive for students who did not speak Afrikaans.\n\n\"The university's determinative motivation for introducing the new policy was to facilitate equitable access to its campus, its teaching and learning opportunities by black students not conversant in Afrikaans.\n\n\"The university showed that, near-universally, brown and white-Afrikaans-speaking first-year entrants to the university are able to be taught in English... The 2014 policy created an exclusionary hurdle for specifically black students,\" Froneman said.\n\nHe added that classes conducted in Afrikaans made people who did not speak Afrikaans \"feel marginalised, excluded and stigmatised\".\n\nWhile the lobby group was disappointed at the ruling, Rossouw said they would be studying the judgment.", "description": "The Constitutional Court's ruling in the Stellenbosch University language policy case hinders mother-tongue education in the country, says the attorney representing lobby group Gelyke Kanse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5274/66979817fe214979b401ed0639a48098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
