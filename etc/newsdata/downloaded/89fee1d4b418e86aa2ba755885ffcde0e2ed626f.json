(Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nAs a windblown President Trump boarded Air Force One in Mountain View, Calif., earlier this week, a Reuters photographer captured a curious image that showed Trump\u2019s tie over his shoulder and what appeared to be a wad of cash in his back suit pocket.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump offered an explanation to reporters traveling with him back to Washington: He doesn\u2019t use a wallet because he no longer uses credit cards, but he likes to leave cash tips at hotels.\n\nAmid a wide-ranging question-and-answer session, a reporter noted that Trump had been photographed with his jacket up in the wind and that $20 bills were visible \u2014 and asked if he regularly carries cash in his pocket.\n\n\u201cI do! I do!\u201d Trump said, taking a wad of bills out of his pocket and holding it up for reporters to see.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t carry a wallet, because I haven\u2019t had to use a credit card in a long time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI do like leaving tips to the hotel. I like to carry a little something. I like to give tips to the hotel. I\u2019m telling you, maybe a president\u2019s not supposed to do it, but I like to leave a tip for the hotel, etcetera, etcetera.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s funny. So the jacket was blowing up?\u201d he added, also observing that the press has \u201cgood cameras.\u201d", "description": "Asked about a photo of him boarding Air Force One, the president told reporters he doesn\u2019t use a wallet because he no longer uses credit cards.
