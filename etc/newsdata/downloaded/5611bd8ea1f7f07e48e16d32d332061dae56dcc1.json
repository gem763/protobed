Yovanovitch, who was recalled as the American ambassador to Ukraine in May, testified to impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official told her that President Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though the department believed she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nIn a closed-door interview that could further fuel calls for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, Ms. Yovanovitch delivered a scathing indictment of how his administration conducts foreign policy. She warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment, threatening to undermine the nation\u2019s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service. And she said that diplomats no longer have confidence that their government \u201cwill have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests.\u201d\n\nAccording to a copy of her opening statement obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Yovanovitch said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d that she was removed as ambassador \u201cbased, as far as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nMs. Yovanovitch, a 33-year veteran of the foreign service and three-time ambassador, spoke to investigators on Capitol Hill in defiance of the White House\u2019s declaration that administration officials would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. She arrived on Friday morning with a lawyer and entered the secure rooms of the House Intelligence Committee in the basement of the Capitol for questioning by congressional staff.", "description": "Ambassador Marie L.
