He just killed it. It was in his soul,' said Jay Garcia, a 30-year-old radio host from the neighboring borough of Queens.\n\nFor longtime Bronx residents like Laura Harry, step streets are a common feature in the borough's hilly landscape.\n\n'I've lived around here for 30 years ... people use them every day,' said Harry, as she stood at the top of the steep stairs with her groceries, gazing at the people below. 'I'm fascinated, because they made the steps famous.'\n\nNot everyone appreciates the extra attention, however. 'Them stairs ain\u2019t nothing but an asthma attack and a swift robbery set up... But you know ... Welcome to The South Bronx,' tweeted one person urging people to stay away.\n\nWhen Arthur Fleck becomes The Joker he dances triumphantly back down them... and now tourists are also attempting to reenact the move\n\nJoker has dominated the box-office for two weeks. It broke the record for the largest October opening weekend in movie history, at $96.2 million.\n\nWhile the borough has struggled with its reputation as a dangerous place, it is perhaps ironic that a threatening figure like the Joker may have helped burnish its image.\n\n'It's good for us. You know, publicity,' said Jose Cruz, a longtime resident who climbs the 131 steps at West 167th Street daily. 'People don't have to be scared of the Bronx no more, the way they used to.'\n\nThe South Bronx has not long been on a list of must-see attractions for out-of-towners but the Joker movie is encouraging people to visit the borough", "description": "The enormous staircase,  located at 167th Street, in the Bronx, New York City, features in the new Todd Philips movie when Joaquin Phoenix dances down them to after becoming the Joker.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/07/19948042-0-image-a-110_1571551232804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
