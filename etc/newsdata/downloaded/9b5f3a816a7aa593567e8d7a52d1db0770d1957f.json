And now the 16-cap second row Helu believes the Brave Blossoms can repeat that feat against the Springboks.\n\n'For me we've already made our goal. No one expected us to make the top eight,' said Helu.\n\n'We've already proved everyone wrong. No one will even look at us to win this game this week, so it's another chance to prove people wrong.\n\nJamie Joseph's side stunned Ireland and also beat Scotland to go on and finish top of Pool A\n\n'We love to give everything for our fans, knowing they will always support us. When you win something, and make something happen like that, you just want to keep going.\n\n'We're still feeling the crowd excitement and support from the last game. Just knowing and finding out how many people were watching the game, that is a huge boost.\n\n'We always know that if we keep winning lots of people will support us. It adds extra motivation. It's such a good feeling. Just the energy that the fans bring. It definitely boosts us, that's for sure.'\n\nMore than 60 million people tuned in to watch Japan see off Scotland and reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nThe Japanese public's growing interest in the World Cup has seen more than 200,000 replica Brave Blossoms shirts sold on home soil during the tournament.\n\nThose Canterbury kits are sold out across the country, and Japan as a nation is likely to stop still again for Sunday night's Springboks clash.\n\nJapan lost 41-7 to South Africa in a World Cup warm-up match in Kumagaya on September 6, but Helu believes that is no indicator of events ahead this weekend.\n\nSouth Africa are heavy favourites to win the quarter-final but will be wary of their hosts\n\nHelu believes it will take a herculean effort to topple the physical South Africans - but also believes the Brave Blossoms are ready.\n\n'That warm-up game was five weeks ago so a lot's changed since then,' said Helu.\n\n'They are a physical team, so we need to be smarter in how we attack, stick to our gameplan - we trust our gameplan. We just need to attack at speed. We're trying to identify specific defenders and exploit them. We need to trick this guy to do that, so we can get good ball.\n\n'South Africa are different from other teams, they did more work as a group. They come in twos and threes when they attack. It doesn't matter if you've got to make 200, 300 tackles. No matter what's coming, you've got to keep tackling. No matter what's coming, we'll take them on any time.'", "description": "Tonga-born lock Helu believes no one in the rugby world will even consider the notion of a Japan victory in this weekend's fascinating last-eight battle against South Africa.", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/19777968-0-image-a-14_1571214487841.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
