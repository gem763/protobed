Among fourth graders, about a third are proficient in reading, and more than 40% are proficient in math, per AP.\n\nFourth-grade reading scores dropped in 17 states, with New Jersey seeing the biggest drop. Mississippi and the District of Columbia both showed gains.\n\nBig-city schools still performed below the nation as a whole, but narrowed the gap.\n\nThe big picture: Students made big gains in math in the 1990s and 2000s but have shown little improvement since then.
