What matters is the long haul, after all.\n\nBut when the bad days start to outnumber the good ones, it\u2019s hard not to worry a little bit. Should you follow the exhortation to \u201cDon\u2019t just do something, stand there!\u201d? Or does serious market volatility warrant corrective action to reduce your exposure to risky assets?\n\nThe right answer is looking right back at you in the mirror. Life stage and proximity to spending from your portfolio should be the main determinant of whether you take action amid a volatile market. If you\u2019re many years from retirement, you can and should go the \u201cjust stand there\u201d route, assuming you were in a reasonably equity-heavy portfolio to begin with. If you\u2019re not spooked by putting money into a declining market, you may even add to your equity holdings during a downturn. But if retirement is drawing close, or if you\u2019re already retired, the right prescription may not be to do nothing; taking action to reduce risk in your portfolio may be the right call.\n\nPsychology is in the mix, too. Even if you have many years until retirement, that doesn\u2019t count for a lot if there\u2019s a chance that you could capitulate at the worst conceivable time because you\u2019re spooked. You\u2019ll also want to factor in any nonretirement goals you have for your funds; chances are they\u2019re shorter-term, and that calls for a lower-risk investment mix.\n\nFinally, given that serious market weakness is often precipitated by concerns over the economy\u2019s health, market volatility can be a wake-up call to check up on other parts of your financial plan. That includes your saving/spending rate, your short-term cash reserves (that is, your emergency fund), your insurance coverage, and your human capital, among other items.\n\nBecause responding to volatile markets is so variable and individual-specific, we\u2019ve organized articles and other tools to help guide you based on life stage. Folks with 15 to 20 years until retirement can head straight to the \u201cIf You're Many Years From Retirement\u201d section, whereas people entering or in drawdown mode can focus on the action items geared toward their situations.\n\nIf You\u2019re Many Years From Retirement\n\nA Down-Market Survival Guide for Your 20s, 30s, and 40s\n\nModel Portfolios for Retirement Savers\n\nHow to Calibrate Your Retirement-Savings Rate\n\nIf You Expect to Retire Within 10 Years\n\nA Down-Market Survival Guide for Preretirees\n\nWhat If This Turns Out to Be a Terrible Time to Retire?\n\nPreretirees: Are You Taking Too Much Risk?\n\nWorking Longer: Good Aspiration But Not a Plan\n\nIf You\u2019re Already Retired\n\nA Down-Market Survival Guide for Retirees\n\nThe Time Is Right to De-Risk Your Retirement Portfolio\n\nRetirees: Are You Spending Too Much?\n\nModel Portfolios for Retirees\n\nArticles and Tools for Investors at All Life Stages\n\nYour Market Downturn Toolkit\n\nIs Your Risk Tolerance at War with Your Risk Capacity?\n\nHow to Assess Your Insurance Needs\n\nTax-Loss Selling: A Silver Lining in Volatile Markets\n\nAssess Your Asset Allocation for Retirement\n\nSet and Invest Your Emergency Fund\n\nMorningstar Lifetime Allocation Indexes\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Instant X-Ray\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Portfolio Manager\n\nIntroducing Morningstar's New Podcast: The Long View\n\nExpand your investing horizons and look to the long term.
