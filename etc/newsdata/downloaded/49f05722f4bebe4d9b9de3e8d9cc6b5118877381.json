The month is cruel to struggling travel businesses, because new bookings are not coming in at sufficient levels to pay off the many bills that are due for the summer.\n\nAdria Airways carried 1.2 million passengers in 2018, the same number as Ryanair flies in three days. Around 100,000 passengers are believed to have forward bookings with the carrier, which was a member of the Star Alliance.\n\nMost of its operations were to and from the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, with key links to Frankfurt, Munich, Prague and Vienna. Adria Airways had secondary hubs at Pristina in Kosovo and the Albanian capital, Tirana.\n\nAs with other small national carriers, Adria Airways was damaged by the rapid growth of low-cost airlines \u2013 notably easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air \u2013 which are now likely to take over the profitable routes. It is possible, though, that Austrian Airlines \u2013 part of the Lufthansa group \u2013 may move in.\n\nAdria Airways was founded in Ljubljana in 1961. During the 1980s, it flew many charter flights between the UK and the then-Yugoslavia, under the brand name Inex Adria.\n\nIt was privatised in 2016 and struggled thereafter against a punishing economic situation caused by intense competition.", "description": "In what has been a dreadful month for European airlines, September ended with a final victim: Adria Airways, the national airline of Slovenia.
