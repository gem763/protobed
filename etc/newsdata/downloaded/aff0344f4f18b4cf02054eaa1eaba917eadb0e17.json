Trump on Wednesday reiterated a familiar attack on Smith, claiming he has \"low ratings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has planted seeds of support for other conservative networks, like One American News Network (OANN), Newsmax and Sinclair Broadcast Group.\n\nBetween the lines: The president often goes after Fox News for giving airtime to Democratic analysts and contributors, specifically ones of color.\n\nAmong his favorite targets are Fox News analyst and The Hill columnist Juan Williams and Fox News contributor and former Democratic National Committee interim chairperson Donna Brazile. Last week, the President tweeted that Williams was \"pathetic\" and \"always nasty and wrong.\" On Wednesday, he mentioned both Williams and Brazile in his tweets attacking the network.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump has been hinting at a Fox News breakup for a while, but it's hard to see a world in which the president actually wants the biggest and most influential conservative-leaning cable news network to turn against him. The tweets are most likely intended to pressure Fox into giving more favorable coverage ahead of a crucial election campaign.", "description": "The president has repeatedly gone after Fox News for giving airtime to Democratic contributors, and specifically ones of color.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/LqKl9PJNjxGkDgYEGzvYJaCf11g=/0x22:3000x1710/1920x1080/2019/08/28/1567007545815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
