Period,' he added, claiming North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's threat to the U.S. will continue to increase.\n\nHis comments came in a letter seeking donations for his 2020 political action committee, John Bolton PAC.\n\nThe former national security adviser was ousted from the Trump administration last month and a few days after departing return to his position as head of both the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC.\n\nFormer National Security Advisor John Bolton tore into Donald Trump's handling of relations with North Korea, claiming the situation would only get worse with time\n\nThe foreign policy hawk was ousted from the Trump administration last month following several clashes on different policy points \u2013 including how to handle attempts to denuclearize North Korea\n\n'I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning,' Trump said in a tweet announcing his departure September 10.\n\n'I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.'\n\nOn September 18, Robert O'Brien assumed Bolton's old position as Trump's national security adviser.\n\nNot even an hour after the president's tweet, Bolton said he offered to resign the night before, but the president pushed it off until the next day.\n\n'I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,' Bolton tweeted to his @AmbJohnBolton account, which has been inactive ever since.\n\nTrump often boasts the relationship he's formed with Kim and insists it will lead to North Korea denuclearization and peace in the region. The two have met in unilateral meetings a few times since Trump took office.\n\nIn June 2019, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in North Korea when he met Kim at the Demilitarized Zone between the North and south.\n\nDespite the apparent rapport between Trump and Kim, the two have not been able to reach an agreement that would lead to the promised denuclearization.\n\nBolton believes the Trump administration's decision not to act more decisively against North Korea will make the nation more dangerous.\n\nThe U.S. and North Korea held talks this month for the first time in almost eight months, and Kim's regime warned Monday that the totalitarian regime could go on a 'new path' if economic sanctions against them aren't eased.\n\nBolton's departure followed several clashes with the president over how to deal with foreign policy issues, including with North Korea and the Kim regime.\n\nAlmost immediately after returning to his PAC, Bolton announced it would be contributing $10,000 to five Republican incumbent candidates' primary and general elections.\n\nHe also endorsed all the five lawmakers: Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado; Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina; Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Representative Lee Zeldin of New York.\n\nBolton\u2019s chastising comments regarding North Korea comes as speculation swirls he could be called to testify in the impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nFiona Hill, in her testimony to House committees Monday, said Bolton told her last summer, while he was still national security adviser, to alert White House lawyers that he was alarmed over an effort to pressure Ukraine for political help.\n\nBolton often expressed concern over Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s involvement in U.S.-Ukraine relations \u2013 especially over his campaign to have former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch prematurely called back from her three-year assignment in Ukraine.", "description": "John Bolton ripped apart Donald Trump's efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula as ineffective, claiming it will get worse with time.\u00a0'North Korea isn't our friend and never will be,' Bolton said.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19854566-0-image-a-2_1571342085276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
