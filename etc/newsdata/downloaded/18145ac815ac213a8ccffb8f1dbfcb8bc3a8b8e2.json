For us, it is to understand each other. I hope we will play more together.\n\n\u2018I am not at my best physically because I didn\u2019t have a proper pre-season like the others.\n\n\u2018I was at the African Cup of Nations. I started little by little and the manager knew about it. I am trying to work hard to be stronger physically to perform well.\n\n\u2018The key to adapting is to have good people around you. I have my family here with me so I can be good mentally, especially when things are not going well. I rely a lot on them.\n\n\u2018For me, it was always going to be difficult to come here to the unknown, with a different language. So to have my family with me is important.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal hero Charlie Nicholas explains why Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea will lose to Burnley\n\nMORE: Arsenal star reveals the secret to Nicolas Pepe\u2019s free-kick prowess", "description": "Nicolas Pepe is hopeful Arsenal's multi-million pound strikeforce will now be given time to forge a proper understanding after he played a starring role in last night's comeback win against...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177970252_1572004129.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
