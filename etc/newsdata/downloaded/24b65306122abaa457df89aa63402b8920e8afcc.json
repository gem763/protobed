They were part of a group of four British ISIS soldiers who beheaded seven Western journalists and aid workers\n\nMs Haines told ITV News: 'There was an instant relief because I think my biggest fear was that they wouldn't serve justice, whether that was from them being freed or being killed.\n\n'But morally you have to wonder why are these two being given special treatment, because they are high profile?'\n\n'Justice is what we are waiting for, that's the end of the story. It is hugely important and it is such a relief that the chances of them escaping are very much lessened now.'\n\nKotey and Elsheikh are being held by the U.S. military in an undisclosed location and it is understood authorities want them to be tried in the state of Virginia.\n\nIn his final media interview from a Syrian prison, Elsheikh told ITV News's Security Editor Rohit Kachroo he wanted to stand trial in the UK.\n\nHe said: 'If the UK wants to put me on trial then I will defend myself with what I can, I will admit to what I admit to, and defend myself on what I defend myself on, that's it.'\n\nOn the prospect of extradition to the U.S., he said he has 'never committed a crime in the United States' and 'has nothing' there.\n\nDavid Haines was captured and murdered by 'the ISIS Beatles' in a filmed execution\n\nThe other two members of the 'Beatles' group infamous for their beheadings were Mohammed Emwazi (left), who was killed in a drone strike in 2015. The fourth member, Aine Davis (right) was convicted in Turkey and sentenced to seven years in prison\n\nThe so-called 'Beatles' cell of killers beheaded seven American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers, and a group of Syrian soldiers, in 2014 and 2015, boasting of the butchery in chilling propaganda videos released to the world.\n\nBritish aid worker Alan Henning was also among those executed, while other victims included US citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig.\n\nAnnouncing the operation, President Trump said: 'We are taking some of the most dangerous Isis fighters out.\n\n'We've taken them out, and we're putting them in different locations where it's secure.'\n\nUS officials confirmed this included Elsheikh, a mechanic from White City in west London, and Kotey, from Paddington, also in west London.\n\nIn a subsequent post on Twitter, Mr Trump added: 'In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles (sic), out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!'\n\nDonald Trump said the two terrorists had been taken out of Syria into U.S. custody\n\nThe pair, who were raised in the UK but have since been stripped of their British citizenship, are among thousands of ISIS fighters, including others from Britain, who have been held in camps in the region.\n\nThey were captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in January 2018.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has said there is 'insufficient evidence' to prosecute them in the UK.\n\nBut Sir John told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We have rather left those Isis detainees in the hands of the Kurds.\n\n'I think it's a very challenging problem. What do you do with up to 10,000 fighters, has been mentioned, and some of them are from Britain? I think there does have to be some concerted effort here.\n\n'Frankly, it was only ever a temporary solution to leave them in a camp in the desert in Syria.\n\n'I think, ultimately, they ought really to be brought back to their home countries to face justice here.\n\n'What's happening now is two former British citizens are likely to face American justice. They should probably face British justice here.'\n\nMr Haines's daughter has travelled to Syria in a bid to get answers about her father's death\n\nEmwazi - the supposed ringleader dubbed Jihadi John - was killed in a US air strike in 2015, while Davis was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years at a court in Silivri, Turkey, in 2017.\n\nKotey, a Muslim convert and a reported father-of-two, was previously described by neighbours in his former west London community as a quiet man who was dedicated to Queens Park Rangers football club.\n\nBut he reportedly became increasingly radicalised and was influential in encouraging young men to join ISIS in Syria.\n\nRaised a Greek Orthodox Christian - his mother is believed to have been Greek-Cypriot and his father Ghanaian - he reportedly converted to Islam as a teenager.\n\nHe is said to have attended the Al-Manaar mosque in Notting Hill in west London along with Emwazi and Davis, before fleeing Britain 10 years ago.\n\nThe pair were moved out of Syria ahead of an invasion of Kurdish held areas by Turkey\n\nElsheikh is said to have come to the UK in 1993 after his family fled Sudan and claimed asylum.\n\nHis mother, Maha Elgizouli, later said her son was influenced by hate preacher Hani al-Sibai, and that the former fairground worker was 'brainwashed' into becoming an extremist after going to sermons at local mosques for little more than two weeks.\n\nHe fled for Syria in 2012.\n\nHis younger brother, Mahmoud Elsheikh, later followed him but was killed fighting for ISIS in Iraq in 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, Ms Elgizouli brought a Supreme Court challenge against the decision of then-home secretary Sajid Javid to share evidence with American authorities without seeking assurances the men would not be executed if convicted in the US.\n\nThe court is expected to give its ruling at a later date.", "description": "David Haines was captured by extremists in 2013 while working for an international relief agency in Syria and was beheaded by\u00a0Mohammed Emwazi the following year.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542186-0-image-a-58_1570716131432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
