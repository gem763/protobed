This is not a path to citizenship,\u201d he said.\n\nBut his administration, in writing the rules for DACA, opened a very large doorway to that path by specifically granting them the chance to win advance parole.\n\nUnder that system, a migrant who has an urgent humanitarian reason can be granted permission to leave, then to re-enter the country. Being paroled back into the U.S. then opens up the citizenship avenue.\n\nParole was put in place nearly 60 years ago as a humanitarian protection to let people into the U.S. without formally admitting them.\n\nBut granting advance parole has no basis in law, said Matt O\u2019Brien, a former official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who is now with the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien said parole was intended to act as a sort of asylum law, giving immigration officials a way to let in people who showed up at the borders or airports having fled communism or other oppressive regimes.\n\nBut advance parole is now being used by people already in the U.S. without solid legal status \u2014 often illegal immigrants \u2014 to skirt the law.\n\nHe said he and other colleagues at USCIS warned the Obama team at the time about the \u201cglaring loophole\u201d they were creating by extending parole to DACA recipients.\n\n\u201cPermitting parolees, who have not been formally admitted to the U.S., to adjust is a glaring loophole in our immigration law. And, in my opinion, it is a loophole that is significantly more dangerous than any of the asylum loopholes,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.\n\nAdvance parole is supposed to be granted only in cases in which a migrant has a compelling need to leave the U.S.\n\nImmigrant-rights organizations set about to create opportunities to give DACA recipients a chance to win green cards.\n\nIn one prominent case, the California-Mexico Studies Center advertised such a program, charging thousands of dollars to give Dreamers a chance to travel to Mexico so they could qualify for advance parole.\n\nPart of the fees the program collects helps pay for \u201clegal advice and filing assistance\u201d in obtaining advance parole.\n\nThe Obama administration had kept the DACA advance parole data secret, refusing to answer inquiries from Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe Trump administration in 2017 reversed that policy and revealed that more than 45,000 DACA recipients had been granted advance parole.\n\nOf those 45,000, USCIS says between 13,908 and 14,358 DACA recipients have gone on to get green cards.\n\nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), the organization that is leading the legal defense of DACA in the courtroom and which pried loose the data from USCIS, declined to comment.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why MALDEF sought the data.\n\nMr. Trump, in announcing his attempt to phase out DACA in 2017, canceled the ability of Dreamers to use advance parole to get on the path to citizenship.\n\nFederal courts have blocked most of the DACA phaseout, but they left in place the advance parole prohibition.\n\n\u201cUSCIS is no longer accepting or approving advance parole requests from DACA recipients under standards associated with the DACA policy,\u201d the agency told The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
