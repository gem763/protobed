REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nThe German lender\u2019s legacy IT systems have been blamed in part for the bank\u2019s failure to control costs and for its slow progress in keeping up with the wave of fintech innovation across the industry.\n\nTechnology has long been a problem for Deutsche Bank. Former Chief Executive John Cryan complained in 2015 about \u201clousy systems\u201d and \u201cvery slow processes\u201d, and former operations chief Kim Hammonds last year described Deutsche as \u201cvastly complex\u201d and the \u201cmost dysfunctional\u201d workplace she has known.\n\nThe central technology division announced on Wednesday will be led by Bernd Leukert, overseeing tech security, data and innovation functions among others, the bank said in a note to employees seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cAt its heart, our technology strategy empowers our businesses to control \u2018what\u2019 is produced, while technology has control of the \u2018how\u2019. In the past, the \u2018how\u2019 offered too much optionality and did not consistently follow group-wide architecture and tooling,\u201d it said.\n\nThe lender also established a board-level Technology, Data and Innovation Committee in May and has vowed to invest 13 billion euros ($14.2 billion) in technology by 2022.\n\nIt will be doing so amid a technology arms race in banking. Research from UBS this year found that JPMorgan (JPM.N) has budgeted $11.4 billion for technology in 2019 alone.\n\nIn its note to staff, Deutsche Bank also said that moving systems to the cloud would not happen overnight, meaning it would continue to invest in legacy infrastructure on which it operates today.\n\nHowever, it pledged to continue to reduce the number of applications and barriers to technology functions.\n\n\u201cWe have a bank-wide commitment to strengthen engineering expertise in the bank by increasing the share of expert internal technology staff,\u201d it said.", "description": "Deutsche Bank is creating a new technology division in a strategy shift designed to reduce complexity and lower costs while transforming systems that have held back the bank for years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438002920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960HD", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
