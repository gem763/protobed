It\u2019s crept into the eastern portion of Utah, the closest it has gotten to Nevada,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe sickness is reportedly transmitted by prions, which are protein particles that have been linked to brain diseases such as mad cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.\n\nPeregrine Wolff, a Nevada Department of Wildlife veterinarian, said she knows Nevada is not totally immune to the sickness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a matter of when. We know that we can\u2019t wrap Nevada in a bubble,\u201d she commented.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that CWD \u201ccan affect animals of all ages and some infected animals may die without ever developing the disease. CWD is fatal to animals and there are no treatments or vaccines.\u201d\n\nHowever, reports said officials have tested dead animals, and are keeping tabs on migrating deer and elk coming over Nevada\u2019s border from Utah.\n\nThis year, Nevada lawmakers \u201cbanned bringing certain animal body parts into the state, including the brain and the spinal cord that can contain large concentrations of prions,\u201d according to a Fox News report.\n\nThe CDC stated that so far, there have been no reports of any humans becoming infected by the disease, but studies have suggested that CWD poses a risk to non-human primates such as monkeys, who might eat meat or come into contact with fluids from an animal infected by the disease.\n\n\u201cThese studies raise concerns that there may also be a risk to people. Since 1997, the World Health Organization has recommended that it is important to keep the agents of all known prion diseases from entering the human food chain,\u201d the CDC concluded.", "description": "Officials in Nevada are working to keep wild animals with the highly contagious chronic wasting disease (CWD) out of their state.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1171364618-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
