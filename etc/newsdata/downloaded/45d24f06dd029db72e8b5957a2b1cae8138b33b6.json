Keep in mind that you can't pick up these $250 earbuds in-store, but if you order today, you're guaranteed delivery on Halloween.\n\nYou can even get them custom engraved with your name, initials or phone number (we're assuming this is some kind of fix for all the people who lose one or both of their AirPods, as one inevitably does).\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Apple More\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AirPods Pro feature:\n\nActive Noise Cancellation: The AirPods Pro use two microphones and proprietary software to adapt to each ear, removing background noise. The first mic is outward-facing and can detect external sounds to create an equivalent \"anti-noise\" that cancels out the distractions before the sounds ever hit your ears. The inward-facing mic cancels any other noise detected. Altogether, the noise cancellation feature adapts to the sounds in your surroundings 200 times per second, according to Apple.\n\nOne-tap connection: After opening the charging case near your iOS devices and giving it a tap, the AirPods Pro instantly connect to all of your Bluetooth-enabled devices on your iCloud account. That goes for Apple TV (hey, no more bugging your roommates or family while you watch television), iPods, Apple Watches and of course iPhones, Macs and iPads.\n\nDifferent sizes: Each earbud comes with three different sizes of silicone ear tips to ensure the AirPods Pro contour to every individual's uniquely shaped ear canal. This also creates a tight seal that Apple says is vital to immersive sound.\n\nPressure equalizer: Apple has created a new vent system to equalize pressure in your ear, minimizing any discomfort that your typical earbuds may cause.\n\nIncreased robustness: AirPods Pro are sweat and water-resistant, so no worries taking them to your next spinning class.\n\nAdaptive EQ: This feature automatically tunes low- and mid-level frequencies in the music to make the sound quality better for each individual, based on their ear shape.\n\nEar Tip Fit Test: this ensures users enjoy the best listening experience possible. Basically, you test the quality of the seal and determine the best size ear tip for your individual canal. Algorithms work together with the mics in each earbud to measure the sound level and help you find your best fit. It sounds like measuring your shoe size at a department store but way more tech savvy.\n\nAudio Sharing: If your friend also has a pair of AirPods, you can listen to the same song or movie together.", "description": "They're here, but you better have a pocket full of money.", "authors": ["Courtney Linder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ts_55A_RldVsC8VNW9U_Tw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/2f8aefa39d1a07c31e36e72a2abcf13d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
