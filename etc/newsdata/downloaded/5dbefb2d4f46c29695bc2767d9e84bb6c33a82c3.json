Mass layoffs came in waves. The prospect of receiving a raise or a bonus was all but laughable.\n\nSears \u2014 once the world's largest retailer \u2014 was heading toward bankruptcy.\n\nAnd as chief human resources officer, Dean Carter was the guy responsible for keeping everyone on staff \u2014 especially the HR reps on his team \u2014 motivated to continue working.\n\nThe strategy Carter eventually hit on taught him a powerful career lesson that applies beyond Sears and beyond HR. It's a lesson that can help any professional feeling unfulfilled in their current role.\n\nCarter left Sears in 2015; he now oversees human resources, finance, and legal at Patagonia. He shared this strategy with Business Insider at LinkedIn's Talent Connect conference, which took place in Dallas in September 2019.\n\n\"We are the band on the Titanic,\" he said.\n\nCarter said he advised his team to \"play really incredible music,\" so that regardless of whether the ship sank, they'd be better musicians afterward.\n\nTo unpack the metaphor: Focus on honing your craft and you'll be better prepared for your next career move, whatever that may be. Not to mention, you'll have a reason to get out of bed every day, even if you'd rather be employed somewhere else.\n\nRead more: The CEO of Patagonia makes a convincing business case for this unorthodox perk\n\nCarter worked at Sears during a tumultuous period\n\nSears' downward spiral has been years in the making.\n\nThe company's sales dropped from $53 billion in 2006 to less than $17 billion in 2017, Business Insider's Hayley Peterson reported.\n\nMore recently, in September 2019, Sears closed 26 Sears and Kmart stores, adding to a list of hundreds, and laid off 250 employees at its corporate headquarters.\n\nThe chaos continues today.\n\nTransform Holdco LLC, Sears' parent company run by chairman Eddie Lampert, bought Sears out of bankruptcy in March 2019. But a few months later, 13 Sears vendors joined a larger group of companies pushing Sears to liquidate so the vendors can claim the money they're owed, Business Insider's Bethany Biron reported.\n\nIf you can't change your job circumstances, try changing your perspective on them\n\nWorking at Sears during a period of tumult (he joined in 2010), Carter learned that shifting your perspective can be helpful when you can't do much to change your circumstances.\n\n\"If you have to be here,\" he said \u2014 because you rely on the paycheck or because there are no other jobs available \u2014 \"then change your framing.\"\n\nSpecifically, he added, \"become great at what you're doing. Make sure you're ready for whatever's next.\" If you end up staying at Sears, he told his team, you'll be a better employee; if you move on to another organization, you'll be a greater asset to that company, too.\n\nRead more: Microsoft's HR chief says to take these 2 steps when you hate your job but feel stuck\n\nCarter's approach is similar to the process of \"job crafting,\" a term coined by Yale professor Amy Wrzesniewski and University of Michigan professor emerita Jane Dutton that describes molding your job to be more meaningful. You can do that by actively changing your daily tasks and also by changing your perspective on your work.\n\nCarter's insights also recall those of Lindsay Gordon, who worked in HR at Google and is now an independent career coach. Gordon previously told Business Insider that it can even be advisable to stay in a boring job that rarely challenges you. Maybe, for example, the job pays well and financial stability is important to you at this time in your life.\n\nThis logic strikes many people as \"revolutionary,\" Gordon wrote in a blog post, but they're often relieved to know \"that their job doesn't have to be everything to them.\"\n\nFor Carter, focusing on developing your skills is part of \"finding the thing that you love and you can connect to,\" even if the overall organizational values don't completely resonate with you.\n\n\"If we can find it at Sears, you can find it anywhere,\" Carter said. \"I don't mean that in a bad way. But it was a really challenging situation, and we learned a lot and grew from it. I am better as a result of my time there.\"", "description": "Sears' former HR chief, Dean Carter, learned firsthand about the power of shifting your perspective when you're stuck in a bad job or company.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9787d04b650712b325df07?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
