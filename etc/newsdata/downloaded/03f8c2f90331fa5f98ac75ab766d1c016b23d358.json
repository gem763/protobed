Franklin Graham Condemns San Francisco Ban on Travel to Pro-Life States", "language": "en", "text": "Christian evangelist Rev. Franklin Graham said progressive leaders in San Francisco who have banned travel for city employees to states that have enacted abortion restrictions \u201cwant everyone to swallow the lie that abortion is a woman\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nAs CNSNews.com observed, Graham posted to Facebook on Tuesday:\n\nCan you believe this? San Francisco is \u201cblacklisting\u201d states with pro-life laws. City employees in San Francisco are forbidden to take work trips or do business with companies in 22 states that have what they interpret as \u201crestrictive abortion laws\u201d in the new year. Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Vallie Brown announced the measure last week. Mayor Breed said, \u201cBy limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.\u201d Progressive socialist leaders like Mayor Breed want everyone to swallow the lie that abortion is a woman\u2019s right\u2014even something to celebrate. But it\u2019s not. Abortion is murdering a child in its mother\u2019s womb. The Bible says, \u201cWoe to those who call evil good and good evil \u2026\u201d (Isaiah 5:20). I\u2019m thankful to God for the many states and individuals across this great land that are standing for life.\n\nAccording to a press release from the office of Mayor London Breed last week, effective January 1, 2020, San Francisco will end \u201ccity-funded travel\u201d to and \u201ccontracting\u201d with 22 states that have enacted abortion restrictions.\n\nAs a result of an ordinance authored by Supervisor Vallie Brown, the city will not do business with those states \u201cbecause of their severe anti-choice policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day in this country, women\u2019s reproductive rights are threatened, and we have to fight back,\u201d Breed said in a statement. \u201cJust as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion,\u201d she added.\n\nBreed\u2019s office said the city\u2019s Department on the Status of Women decided the list of banned states based on a review of their abortion laws. The states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nAccording to the press statement, nine of the states have already been on the \u201cbanned\u201d list because their LGBTQ laws appeared to be discriminatory in the eyes of San Francisco officials.\n\n\u201cThanks to the leadership of Mayor Breed and Supervisor Brown, San Francisco is showing other cities and states how to stand up against dangerous laws that restrict a woman\u2019s right to control her own body,\u201d said Gilda Gonzales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Northern California, in the mayor\u2019s press statement. \u201cNow, more than ever, we must work to expand, not ban, reproductive rights for all.\u201d", "description": "Rev.
