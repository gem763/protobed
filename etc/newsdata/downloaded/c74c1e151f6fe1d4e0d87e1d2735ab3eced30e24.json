And guess what: it happened. pic.twitter.com/yPyIZua1j2\n\nTurkey\u2019s military incursion against the Kurds \u2013 US allies in the fight against Isis \u2014 is \u201ca shitshow\u201d, said Noah. \u201cThanks to Trump\u2019s impulsive decision, people are now fleeing Syria, the Turkish are now bombing the Kurds, and over 10,000 Isis fighters could be back on the loose.\u201d\n\nAnd in the midst of this disaster, Noah continued, Donald Trump \u201cis responding the only way he knows how: by being petty as hell\u201d. In a press conference on Thursday, Trump defended his decision by saying that the Kurds did not help the US in the second world war. (They did, in fact, assist the Allies). The argument is ridiculous, Noah said, though \u201cto be fair, not helping in a war is one area President Bone Spurs has experience with\u201d.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Trump handling impeachment 'about as well as you expect, which is badly' Read more\n\nOne major concern of Turkey\u2019s attack is the likely release of many Isis prisoners, though this didn\u2019t seem to concern Trump; asked his thoughts on the threat this could pose, he responded: \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really heartless,\u201d Noah said. Trump also needs Europe, because \u201cwithout Europe, there\u2019s no Romania. Without Romania, there\u2019s no vampires. Without vampires, you don\u2019t have a lawyer,\u201d Noah said over a picture of Rudy Giuliani. \u201cAnd then who would the FBI indict?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a shortsighted strategy, Noah continued. \u201cThey could come back stronger than ever. It\u2019s like the Backstreet Boys \u2013 we took our eyes off them, they regrouped, and now they\u2019re touring all over the world.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nSupport for impeachment among voters has increased in recent weeks, \u201cand it really feels like a potentially seismic political shift is happening right now\u201d, said Seth Meyers on Late Night. Meyers also pointed to the Fox News poll, which showed 51% support for Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office.\n\nThe poll must be especially infuriating for Trump because \u201cFox News is what Trump watches to feel good about himself,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThat\u2019s like if a kid turned on Sesame Street and Big Bird was just smoking a cigarette going: \u2018Face it, kid, you\u2019re never going to learn how to spell.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, more and more details continue to emerge on what Meyers called \u201cthe scheme Trump and his gang of mafia-themed Pez dispensers concocted to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Trump initially attempted to blame the phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 the one that launched a whistleblower complaint and impeachment inquiry \u2013 on the energy secretary, Rick Perry. But reporters have now uncovered that Trump directed Perry to meet with Rudy Giuliani about Ukraine, which means \u201cTrump concocted a scheme to dangle hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, as part of a quid pro quo to get them to dig up dirt on a political opponent, and to carry out this plan he chose as his henchman Rick Perry and Rudy Giuliani, who are famously two of the dumbest people in politics,\u201d said Meyers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like if Lex Luthor hatched a plan to kill Superman and chose as his assassins Mr Bean and Woody from Cheers.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nJimmy Kimmel also enjoyed the findings of the latest Fox News poll \u2013 51% in favor of impeachment and removal from office, up nine points from July. \u201cI would love to have been with him when he saw this,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting there, enjoying some Lou Dobbs time, and this pops on the screen. I bet he spit his McFlurry all over the room.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president, Mike Pence, meanwhile, traveled to Iowa to rally support for the president. \u201cThe vice-poodle has been a very good boy for his president,\u201d said Kimmel \u2013 Pence had said in order to help exonerate Trump, he was willing to release transcripts of his own calls with the Ukrainian president. \u201cIn other words, I will prove my boss didn\u2019t rob that convenience store by releasing a video of me not robbing a convenience store,\u201d Kimmel explained.\n\nFinally, two clients of Rudy Giuliani were arrested on Wednesday for illegal campaign donations while they attempted to board a one-way flight to Europe. \u201cNot only does Trump hire the worst people, he hires the worst people who go on to hire more of the worst people,\u201d Kimmel said of Giuliani\u2019s team. \u201cIt\u2019s like a worst people nesting doll he\u2019s got.\u201d\n\nTrump of course said he didn\u2019t know the two men (Kimmel showed a photo of him with one) and told reporters he had \u201cnothing to do with it\u201d.\n\nTranslation: \u201cGoodbye, Rudy!\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cI love to watch Trump turn on these guys who would kill for him. We\u2019re about three weeks away from him claiming he never met Rudy Giuliani.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts assess Turkey\u2019s Trump-facilitated military strikes in northern Syria and the unraveling of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s team", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d747fa6d75d5a0f22b7f83eb3ba50ba5e9a8ff25/124_0_1520_912/master/1520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53ae53b1f5bfcf2c855f371cc3a89be2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
