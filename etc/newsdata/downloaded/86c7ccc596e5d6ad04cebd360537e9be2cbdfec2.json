This is our chance to build a country for the many not the few and fit for the next generation.\"\n\n\"There is an alternative of a government that invests in all parts of the country, a government that's determined to end injustice in our society.\"\n\nEarlier in the day Mr Johnson said: \"All they want to do is procrastinate.\"\n\n\"They don't want to deliver Brexit on October 31, on November 31, even on January 31.\"\n\nHe added: \"They just want to spin it out forever, until the 12th of never.\n\n\"And when the 12th of never eventually comes around, they'll devise one of their complicated parliamentary procedures and move a motion for a further delay and a further extension then.\"\n\n(Image: Rob Pinney/LNP)\n\nMr Johnson said an election was needed because delaying Brexit is \"seriously damaging to the national interest\", while a fresh Parliament would have a \"new mandate to deliver on the will of the people and get Brexit done\".\n\nThe Brexit extension Brussels granted on Monday paved the way for the winter ballot.\n\nIt meant the humiliated Tory leader will miss his pledge to pull Britain out of the bloc by Thursday\u2019s Halloween deadline, \u201cdo or die, come what may\u201d.\n\nHe claimed he would be \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d then extend the UK\u2019s membership, beyond October 31.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs a general election was the only way to break the Brexit deadlock after Brussels delayed the UK\u2019s EU departure until January 31 - ruling out a no-deal departure for three months.\n\nA fresh poll was needed because \u201cdelaying is becoming seriously damaging to the national interest\u201d, the PM said.\n\nA newly-elected Parliament would have a \u201cnew mandate to deliver on the will of people and get Brexit done\u201d, he claimed.\n\nBut one Downing Street insider admitted they were \u201cnervous\u201d.\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson MP said the poll would \"decide the future of our country for generations\".\n\n\"It is our best chance to elect a Government to stop Brexit,\" she added.\n\nThe last December general election was in 1923 when a Tory PM parachuted into No10 blew his Commons majority as he failed to win his own mandate.\n\nA minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s like dropping a can of paint on the floor and watching it splatter. Nobody knows how it\u2019s going to fall.\u201d\n\nThere was deep unease among Tories about the prospect of a pre-Brexit election.\n\nAnalysts believe poor weather , dark mornings and early nights could hammer doorstep canvassing and the numbers of electors going to polls.\n\nVoters could face the coldest winter for 30 years amid a new \u201cBeast from the East\u201d big freeze.\n\nMr Corbyn backed a suggestion for polling day to be made a Bank Holiday to boost turnout.\n\nThe election will offer voters the chance to oust the Tories, who have ruled since May 2010 under David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson.\n\nThe go-ahead for the snap ballot - which will be the third general election in four-and-a-half years - came despite an attempt to throw open the ballot to 16 and 17-year-olds, along with three million EU citizens living in the UK.\n\nTory insiders feared that if the two groups were handed a ballot, it could skew the outcome in favour of Remain-supporting parties and against the Conservatives.\n\nDowning Street threatened to pull its Bill calling for an early election if MPs supported the move.\n\nA No10 source said the bid was an attempt to \u201cgerrymander\u201d the result.\n\nBut the amendments were not selected by Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\n\nMinisters also ruled out a non-aggression pact with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nHe wants a clear path in Leave-backing Labour battlegrounds so the party can win its first seats.\n\nBut a Tory minister said: \u201cHe needs to make a decision - if they stand against us in target seats then they\u2019ll hand the keys of No10 to Corbyn.\u201d\n\nTen of the 21 Tory rebels booted out for helping take no-deal off the table last had the party whip restored after meeting the PM in his Commons office.\n\nEx-Chancellor Philip Hammond was not among the group, but it is understood there is a route back if the other 11 want to return to the fold.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA Tory spokesman said: \u201cWhat has been very clear is there has been a ladder to climb for some of those 21 - some have taken the decision to climb that ladder, others have not.\u201d\n\nTwo of those readmitted - Sir Nicholas Soames and Richard Harrington - are among dozens of MP from various parties who have already announced they will not seek re-election.\n\nMP Heidi Allen, who was elected for the Tories in 2017, quit the party this year to join Change UK and then defected to the Lib Dems, confirmed she was standing down.\n\nShe said in a letter: \u201cI am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace.\n\n\u201cNobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive e-mails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.\n\n\u201cOf course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all to regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.\n\nThe Conservatives will be confident of winning back her South Cambs seat, which the party won with a majority of nearly 16,000 two years ago.\n\nExperts warned of turmoil on the money markets as the campaign hots up.\n\nDeVere Group founder Nigel Green said: \u201cThis is a critical stage in the slow-moving, damaging, torturous Brexit saga.\n\n\u201cExpect the pound and UK financial assets to be increasingly volatile in the run-up to the general election, given the wide-ranging set of outcomes.", "description": "The early election Bill will be debated in the Lords tomorrow before it is given Royal Assent Thursday", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Pippa Crerar", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Rob Pinney Lnp", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752543.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
