He climbs atop the ATV and hoists a sack of gray pellets, which he pours into an aluminum hopper, one of three on his ranch.\n\nIf the deer don\u2019t eat the feed, the turkeys will. Mr. Dell\u2019aquila would rather shoot deer than turkeys, so he doles out 50 pounds of feed a day, and has cleared land and expanded ponds to attract more of the white-tailed quarry that roam these hills and valleys.\n\nHe\u2019s dismissive of local hunters who brag about the young bucks they\u2019ve bagged \u2013 and determined to keep them off his ranch, which is studded with private-property notices and heat-and-motion sensors to monitor wildlife and unbidden humans. \u201cThese people in a lifetime never shot a 200-point deer,\u201d he says, referring to a particular scoring system for a rare antler size. \u201cI\u2019d like to be the person who shoots one.\u201d\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila stands 6 feet, 6 inches tall and has the girth of a football lineman, which he once was. He has been known to eat two 48-ounce steaks for dinner. He pitches forward with an ursine gait, and when he talks, a low rumble of digressive and didactic points, it\u2019s the voice of Sylvester Stallone playing Rocky.\n\nIt\u2019s 90 degrees in the shade as he steers his ATV into a field where he\u2019s installed solar-powered irrigation for his fledgling fruit trees. A skein of wood ducks crosses the cloudless afternoon sky.\n\nA retired millionaire, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila could afford to hire enough workers and equipment to turn his 862-acre ranch into a hunting and fishing redoubt. But that\u2019s not work, and work \u2013 sweaty, hazardous, dusty outdoor work \u2013 is what makes him tick when he\u2019s out here. \u201cThis is where I come up with my best ideas,\u201d he says.\n\nLately those ideas have been targeted at the National Rifle Association, of which Mr. Dell\u2019aquila is a lifetime member and, until recently, a financial supporter. Today he regrets his past generosity to a group whose stated mission \u2013 to defend the right to bear arms \u2013 is one he avows as his own. Mr. Dell\u2019aquila wants to see the NRA\u2019s scandal-plagued management gone and is putting his broad shoulder to the wheel, using financial and legal pressure to force reform.\n\nForget about Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire who bankrolls gun control initiatives all over the country. Forget about Democratic efforts in Congress to expand background checks. Forget the students of Parkland, Florida, and their earnest anti-gun crusade. The real threat to the NRA \u2013 for decades, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the United States \u2013 may be from a handful of members who want to blow up the organization from the inside.\n\nIn this case, however, they aren\u2019t trying to make the lobbying group impotent. They want to make it stronger \u2013 and gun rights even more inviolate. Mr. Dell\u2019aquila is one of the most resolute members of this growing internal revolt by gun lovers against the leaders of a nonprofit that is a synecdoche for U.S. civilian firepower and political clout.\n\n\u201cThe organization has political problems, legal problems, and financial problems,\u201d says Robert Spitzer, a political scientist and author of several books on gun rights. \u201cAnd, ironically, it\u2019s their own fault.\u201d\n\nThe NRA has weathered internal and external crises before, from political controversies to boardroom coups. But its latest fracas may prove existential: Its finances are already listing from mounting legal fees and boycotts by wealthy donors like Mr. Dell\u2019aquila, who accuses chief executive Wayne LaPierre and other officials of reckless spending and self-dealing. At the same time, attorneys general in New York and Washington, D.C., are investigating financial irregularities at the NRA and its charitable foundation that could affect its nonprofit status. \u201cThey got polluted. They\u2019re enriching themselves,\u201d says Mr. Dell\u2019aquila.\n\nIt\u2019s a comeuppance that has gun control advocates salivating. But the uproar within the NRA doesn\u2019t signal any retreat by gun owners in the fractious fight over firearm laws. Should the NRA fall on its sword, other pro-gun groups that are more militant in asserting their constitutional rights are ready to step in, including at statehouses where most gun laws are written.\n\n\u201cThe gun lobby is not a bunch of overpaid suits in D.C.,\u201d says Jeff Knox, Arizona-based director of The Firearms Coalition. \u201cThe gun lobby is you and me, gun owners and lovers of liberty around the country who stand up and argue for their rights.\u201d\n\nThe NRA, which is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, insists it is rooting out waste and that its critics, including ousted former president Oliver North, were blocking reform. It accuses disgruntled donors like Mr. Dell\u2019aquila of abandoning the fight against \u201canti-gun Democrats\u201d in Congress. And even as Mr. LaPierre has become a pincushion for pro-gun critics, he still has a hotline to President Donald Trump, for whom gun owners represent a totemic constituency.\n\nThis is a war of attrition that will shape the future of the world\u2019s largest gun lobby. And David Dell\u2019aquila is all in.\n\nGuns and childhood\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila grew up in a Pittsburgh suburb, one of four children. His father, Louis Dell\u2019aquila, was a lawyer at the Veterans Administration and an accomplished chef who would invite family and friends over on Christmas Eve for an Italian-style feast.\n\nTo hear David Dell\u2019aquila tell it, he had an unhappy childhood. He was diagnosed with a speech impediment and didn\u2019t speak until he was 3. At age 5, in 1966, he was sent to The Pathfinder School, a special education facility where he learned little, except that he didn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nTo his father, his social exclusion was a mark of failure, and he would refer to his son as \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d says Mr. Dell\u2019aquila. In sixth grade he was allowed to transfer to public school and Mr. Dell\u2019aquila began to excel in class, relying on rote memorization to overcome his speech limitations. \u201cThere are still words I stay away from,\u201d he says, as he reclines on a sofa beneath a mounted boar\u2019s head at his modest ranch house.\n\nHis embrace of guns started early. His father\u2019s VA buddies taught him to use a shotgun to kill rabbits and squirrels, and he got his hunting safety certificate at age 12. His taste for hunting, combined with a competitive streak, has stayed with him. He\u2019s shot bears in Quebec and big game in South Africa. He carries a handgun on his ATV in case he runs into snakes.\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila excelled on the gridiron. He turned down several college scholarships, though, and went instead to Princeton University because it was ranked first that year academically, and he liked to be first. He weighed 320 pounds and played football until he injured his back in his sophomore year, but he was never a jock. \u201cI always hung out with the weedy 99-pounders,\u201d he says. \u201cI would always go for the underdog.\u201d\n\nHe graduated in 1984 and pursued a career in technology and financial services, changing jobs frequently, earning high salaries, and investing wisely. At age 46, he figured he had made enough to retire. By then he had married Marita, his second wife, whom he met at Citibank.\n\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve retired pretty much anywhere,\u201d he says. Maryland, where they lived at the time on a 13-acre suburban lot, was out. Taxes were too high \u2013 and gun laws too tight. When they shot targets on their property, as they liked to do, the cops often showed up.\n\n\u201cHow about that one time when they asked you, \u2018Where\u2019s your wife?\u2019 \u201d interjects Marita Dell\u2019aquila. \u201cI had to come out and prove to them that I was all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a couple of times,\u201d he notes. They considered moving abroad, but Mr. Dell\u2019aquila didn\u2019t want to be told what guns he could and couldn\u2019t own. \u201cWe looked at New Zealand. Even in New Zealand, they don\u2019t have great gun rights,\u201d he says.\n\nIn 2011 they moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and acquired the ranch in southern Kentucky, a two-hour drive. A few years later, in 2015, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila decided to boost his support for the NRA. He and Ms. Dell\u2019aquila donated $100,000 and agreed to change their will to leave several million dollars from their estate to the organization, making them Charlton Heston Society Ambassador Members, part of an inner circle of elite donors.\n\n\u201cHad I known the corruption and graft and everything going on I would never have had anything to do with them,\u201d he says.\n\nBig budget and agenda\n\nIn 2018, the NRA reported $360 million in revenue, of which $110 million was contributions from individuals and companies. Another $170 million came from millions of regular members \u2013 the exact number is unknown \u2013 who pay annual dues starting at $45. The organization also raises money separately for its charitable foundation and political action committee.\n\nSome NRA donor dollars are used for firearms training and education. But by far the biggest expenses are political lobbying and public relations, which is how most nonmembers encounter the NRA and its agenda: Since the 1980s, the organization has embedded itself in politics and policy to a degree that virtually no other special-interest group can match.\n\nThe lore surrounding the NRA\u2019s political clout took root after the 1994 midterm elections, in which Democrats lost control of the House for the first time in a generation. Incumbent lawmakers were defeated in large numbers, including many who had supported a ban on assault weapons. Gun policy wasn\u2019t the only factor favoring the Republicans, but the takeaway was clear: Cross the NRA at your peril.\n\n\u201cThe NRA was an unforgiving master,\u201d President Bill Clinton wrote in \u201cMy Life,\u201d his 2004 memoir, referring to the midterm defeat. \u201cOne strike and you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nThe mythology about the organization remains strong, though doubts have grown over time about the power of the NRA and its members to reward and punish lawmakers on Election Day. \u201c[The NRA\u2019s] reputation exceeds their actual ability to elect people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been elected,\u201d says Dr. Spitzer, who chairs the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland. \u201cTheir bark is worse than their bite.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who long avoided gun control as a losing issue have more recently become emboldened: They now trumpet the NRA\u2019s low public-approval ratings and openly raise money from gun control groups, which for the first time outspent the NRA and other gun rights organizations in the 2018 midterms. Demographics also tell a story worrisome to the NRA. Fifty-one percent of households reported having a firearm in 1980, according to the University of Chicago. By 2018 that share had fallen to 35%; for 18-to-34-year-olds it was 30%.\n\nFor Republicans in safe seats, though, the calculus is different. Even as polls show considerable bipartisan support for universal background checks and other restrictions, GOP lawmakers who go soft on gun rights are likely to face primary challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about intensity,\u201d says Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of support for gun control in America. But the pro-gun rights voters are much more dedicated to this issue.\u201d\n\nLike many lobbying groups, the NRA often rallies support by stoking fears and invoking dire scenarios. It portrays even the most innocuous gun control measure as a step toward the confiscation of all firearms.\n\n\u201cOur opponents call themselves gun control advocates. They are not. They ought to call themselves what they really are: the vanguard of the disarm America movement,\u201d Mr. North, then-president of the NRA, told a conservative conference in 2018.\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila broadly shares this Manichaean worldview. He believes an armed citizenry serves as a check against foreign and domestic tyrants, protects people from criminals, and is a fundamental part of American liberty. His answer to issues like school shootings is not to restrict gun sales but to arm teachers. \u201cI don\u2019t see compromise,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s brought up by liberals to get rid of guns or ban guns.\u201d\n\nHow the curtain came down\n\nThe NRA\u2019s annual convention, held in the spring, is a social gathering, arms fair, and political powwow wrapped into one. It\u2019s also a window for members into the group\u2019s governance, as overseen by a 76-member board of directors.\n\nIn 2016, the NRA went all in for President Trump and at-risk Republican Senate candidates, spending more than $50 million. In battleground states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, it framed Hillary Clinton and Democratic lawmakers as existential threats to Second Amendment rights. Its record outlay on the election paid political dividends \u2013 NRA-opposed legislation was a nonstarter in Washington \u2013 but left it increasingly in the red, unable to cover costs.\n\nInternal gripes about these expenditures began to leak out, including details of Mr. LaPierre\u2019s compensation package, more than $40 million in billings by the NRA\u2019s longtime advertising agency in Oklahoma City, and monthly payments to a law firm that Mr. North, in a letter to the NRA\u2019s general counsel, described as \u201cdraining NRA cash at mind-boggling speed.\u201d\n\nSo when NRA members gathered in Indianapolis in April, a tussle over expenses had become a power struggle between Mr. North and Mr. LaPierre, who accused his rival of plotting a coup. By the third morning of the convention, the battle was over: Mr. North was resigning as president, a board member informed a stunned audience.\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila sat there and thought, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re done here. He wasn\u2019t surprised \u2013 he had heard the news at a private donors\u2019 dinner the previous night \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t stomach how supine the board was toward Mr. LaPierre amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement.\n\nHe walked out of the convention hall and into a hubbub. \u201cPeople came up to me and my wife and said, \u2018Can you do something?\u2019\u201d\n\nA plan to reform\n\nLet\u2019s write a letter to the board calling for a full investigation, one suggested. Mr. Dell\u2019aquila shook his head. He had read up on how the NRA put down previous revolts and concluded that a resistance campaign had to be done right.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the NRA\u2019s lavish salaries and benefits that riled Mr. Dell\u2019aquila and other members. Executives oversaw payments to related parties, including donations by the NRA Foundation to a charity run by Mr. LaPierre\u2019s wife, and NRA executives received compensation from outside vendors.\n\nAt the Indianapolis convention, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila says he asked Carolyn Meadows, who replaced Mr. North as president, about the NRA\u2019s expenditures. How can it be ethical, he asked, for NRA executives to own shares in NRA vendors? \u201cShe said, \u2018That\u2019s how it\u2019s done in D.C.,\u2019\u201d he says. Ms. Meadows denies she said that.\n\nBy July, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila was ready to hit back. He announced that until the NRA replaced its leadership, reformed its board, and audited all its contracts, he and other frustrated donors would stop giving money. It was a calculated blow at the group\u2019s wobbly finances that added to the tumult among grassroots members who had taken to pro-gun media to vent about the NRA.\n\nHe also started grading the directors A through F for their oversight of management. Since April, seven directors have resigned from the board. \u201cI have told NRA directors that I can be one of the NRA\u2019s biggest advocates or worse nightmare, and Mr. LaPierre and his leadership team have chosen the latter,\u201d Mr. Dell\u2019aquila wrote to the board in July.\n\nHe says he has commitments from NRA supporters to withhold nearly $165 million, including cash donations and estate giving, in order to effect reforms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not donating another dime to the NRA until Wayne LaPierre and all of his cronies are out of there,\u201d says Randy Luth, a gun industry veteran and NRA donor whose St. Cloud, Minnesota-based company makes accessories for AR-15s. \u201cNobody is watching the piggy bank. Everyone is getting fat off the hard-earned dollars of NRA members.\u201d\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila asks members to make their own pledges on his website. At the ranch house, Ms. Dell\u2019aquila pulls up a spreadsheet on her laptop showing the results. More than 1,000 have responded. Each lists a name, membership number, and the amount to be withheld, ranging from $45 to $3 million, along with a comment. \u201cDRAIN THE SWAMP!\u201d wrote one.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging fraud and misconduct against the NRA, the NRA Foundation, and Mr. LaPierre over their solicitations of his gifts and misuse of funds. He is seeking a class action certification, which would allow other donors to collect from any settlement. In a statement, Ms. Meadows called the suit \u201ca misguided and frivolous pursuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDavid has a huge amount of passion to get some change,\u201d says Mr. Luth. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t necessarily agree with his methods ... [but] he\u2019s on a mission.\u201d\n\nGroups to take the giant's place\n\nThe firing range behind Mr. Dell\u2019aquila\u2019s house lies over a creek that is dust-dry on a hot September afternoon. He backs up his ATV and loads it with boxes of 9 mm and .45-caliber shells for three handguns. His semi-automatic rifles and collectible guns, including a Colt .45 with a handle made from meteorite \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never fired it\u201d \u2013 are stored at the house in Nashville.\n\nHe drives over the creek and pulls up. \u201cHoney,\u201d he calls back to Marita. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead deer here.\u201d A fawn lies by the grass. Mr. Dell\u2019aquila checks for signs of a coyote attack. \u201cIt might\u2019ve lost its mother,\u201d he speculates. Rain hasn\u2019t fallen in weeks; the deer may have died of thirst or stress.\n\nOn the range, Mr. Dell\u2019aquila loads a pistol and fires in quick succession at a pair of metal targets 30 yards away, hitting nearly every time. When it comes to firearm safety, he\u2019s a stickler for rules. But cut him loose on the ranch with heavy equipment, and he\u2019s a daredevil. Two years ago, he was using his bulldozer to clear a path when it slid down a steep hill, tipping upside down and nearly crushing him. \u201cI can always tell when something happens,\u201d says Ms. Dell\u2019aquila. He comes home, quiet and subdued. \u201cThen he\u2019ll say, \u2018Don\u2019t get mad at me, but ...\u2019\u201d\n\nHe nods. \u201cI don\u2019t have a concept of self-preservation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of temerity that could make Mr. Dell\u2019aquila the hunter who delivers a potentially fatal shot to the NRA \u2013 and brings down a pro-gun powerhouse ahead of the 2020 election. Both his boycott campaign and civil suit are frontal attacks on a cash-strapped group whose net assets fell last year to $16 million, from $75 million in 2015. The NRA has frozen its pension fund and borrowed against insurance policies and the deed to its Fairfax headquarters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have the money to plow into next year\u2019s elections as they did in 2016,\u201d says Dr. Spitzer.\n\nSome activists say a shrunken or shuttered NRA may not be a big loss since other advocacy groups can pick up the baton, shorn of the bloat and bombast. \u201cIt\u2019s disingenuous for the NRA to say they\u2019re the only game in town,\u201d says Rob Pincus, a firearms trainer and gun rights advocate. \u201cWe\u2019re waking up from the illusion that we could just be NRA members and that\u2019s all we need to do\u201d to defend gun rights.\n\nMichael Hammond, the legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, says its membership has grown from 1.5 million to 2 million over the past year, which he credits to its uncompromising message on gun rights and the NRA\u2019s reputational hit. \u201cPeople who used to contribute to the NRA are contributing to us,\u201d he says. He prefers that the NRA stays strong, but believes the gun movement is bigger than a single group.\n\nMr. Dell\u2019aquila has another trick up his sleeve: He\u2019s working with Mr. Pincus to organize a Second Amendment rally on Nov. 2 in Washington, D.C., an end run around the NRA\u2019s claim to speak for all gun owners. \u201cUltimately,\u201d he says, \u201cthe people will have the final say.\u201d\n\nRelated stories\n\nRead this story at csmonitor.com\n\nBecome a part of the Monitor community", "description": "NRA corruption allegations have weakened the group.
