But Biden views Warren\u2019s singling out of tech as misguided and doesn\u2019t think a president should tell antitrust enforcers which companies to go after, his campaign said.\n\nA close adviser said Biden\u2019s camp is reluctant to become drawn into what it views as Warren\u2019s \u201cweird litmus test.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you want to go after \u2018Big Tech\u2019 and break them up,\u201d said one senior economic policy official from the Obama White House who remains sympathetic to Biden. (The person spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss tensions that go back to the days of a presidency that Warren also served in.) \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot harder to come up with a coherent theory of the case of why that\u2019s a better outcome for consumers, prices, and innovation.\u201d\n\nThe Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Warren\u2019s approach looks to be working for her. Even where it might be least expected: In the last quarter of fundraising, she raised nearly a quarter-million dollars from employees of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, some of the very companies she has pledged to break up.\n\nSally Hubbard, the director of enforcement at the Open Markets Institute, an advocacy group deeply involved in the push for antitrust enforcement on tech companies, argued that Biden is carrying on the Obama administration\u2019s light-touch approach to the industry. Meanwhile, Warren is tapping into Americans\u2019 emerging sense that something is not quite right with Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cPeople are understanding that it\u2019s not just some technocratic, boring area,\u201d Hubbard said of the antitrust debate Warren has helped ignite. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally about equality and freedom, the American way, the American dream. It\u2019s at the heart of capitalism and what we think of core American values.\u201d\n\nHubbard said she sees the Silicon Valley workers who give to Warren as acting in their own interests: Corporate breakups mean more employers to compete for their labor. Another factor is tech employees\u2019 agreement with Warren\u2019s push to fundamentally restructure the U.S. economy, said Peter Leyden, who runs a public policy-focused Silicon Valley media startup called Reinvent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not contradictory or weird,\u201d said Leyden, a former managing editor of Wired. \u201cIn general, tech workers in northern California, they\u2019re roughly down with it \u2014 that we have to rebalance the economy from a grossly unequal society.\u201d\n\nThe different tacks that Warren and Biden have taken on this massively powerful industry go back before the Obama era, to at least 2005, when the pair battled over bankruptcy reform.\n\nThat year, the Delaware senator and the Harvard law professor debated back and forth in a tense, substantive Senate hearing. At one point, Biden offered Warren the mixed compliment that she was making \u201ca very compelling and mildly demagogic argument.\u201d\n\nThe same phrase could capture the case Warren has made for breaking up tech, starting with a Medium post in March that said \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d to break up Google, Facebook, and Amazon \u2014 pledging that when she becomes president, her administration will do just that.\n\nAnd Warren has hardly let up on the issue.\n\nShe posted a billboard in San Francisco, near a train station frequented by tech workers, blaring the message \u201cBreak Up Big Tech.\u201d More recently, after leaked audio recorded Mark Zuckerberg saying his company would be forced to sue a Warren administration if it went ahead with a breakup, Warren has leaned into the fight \u2014 tweeting again and again her disdain for Facebook. She even ran a deliberately false ad designed to jab Facebook over a newly announced policy on misleading ads, which she and other critics say lets President Donald Trump get away with running lies on the platform.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has said little. But in response to repeated requests, his campaign sent along a quote from a campaign spokesperson outlining his thinking.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden is running for President to rebuild America\u2019s middle class and a critical element of getting that done is ensuring that all corporations \u2014 including tech giants \u2014 are treating their workers and customers fairly,\u201d read the statement from campaign spokesperson Mike Gwin. \u201cTo accomplish this, a Biden administration will aggressively use all the tools available \u2014 including utilizing antitrust measures \u2014 to ensure that these corporations are behaving in a responsible manner and contributing to a greater prosperity for our economy and middle class.\u201d\n\nPeople close to Biden say the former vice president is reined in by his reluctance to dictate targets and methods to regulators in a future Biden administration. By a combination of both tradition and statute, the country\u2019s chief antitrust enforcers \u2014 the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 operate at a distance from the White House.\n\nRecent history offers at least one example of a vice president-turned-presidential candidate paying a political cost for refusing to dictate to regulators.\n\nIn 2000, then-Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore balked at speaking out against an airport planned for the edges of the Florida Everglades, in part over worries about corrupting an ongoing Air Force analysis of the project. Gore instead called for a \u201cbalanced solution\u201d \u2014 prompting some Florida environmental activists to endorse Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who accused him of \u201cwaffling as usual.\u201d Nader wound up getting 97,000 votes in Florida, far exceeding the 537-vote margin that delivered the state and the White House to George W. Bush.\n\nThat said, in the Trump era, political norms aren\u2019t once they were.\n\nAs a candidate in 2016, Trump declared that his administration would block AT&T\u2019s attempt to buy Time Warner, saying the deal would put \u201ctoo much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d After Trump won, his Justice Department indeed sued to stop the sale. And while a judge let it go through, AT&T couldn't get traction with the argument that the president had inappropriately meddled in the DOJ's decision making.\n\nBiden is arguably in the mainstream of the Democratic field: No candidate has come close to Warren\u2019s call for breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon, even though the Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s debate took turns detailing a wide range of complaints about Silicon Valley\u2019s behavior and effect on society.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But none agreed fully when asked point-blank whether Warren's breakup proposals were right.\n\nInstead, several responded that as president, they would install strong antitrust enforcers to go after monopolies in multiple industries. \u201cWe need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro called for \"cracking down on monopolistic trade practices.\u201d New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said, \u201cI will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.\u201d\n\nOnly two candidates clearly objected, in whole or part, to Warren's proposal: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang argued that \u201ccompetition doesn\u2019t solve all the problems.\u201d And former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke lodged the strongest rejection of the Warren plan: \u201cI don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done.\u201d\n\nBiden didn't get a chance to answer. But the divide between Biden and Warren is helping to define the terms of the debate, and it is shaping how an eventual Democratic president might navigate its relationship with the powerful and deep-pocketed U.S. tech industry.\n\nThe source close to the Biden campaign said the topic remains a \u201clive issue\u201d inside that operation, meaning the team is still working through how to talk about the way he would handle Silicon Valley.\n\nThe former Obama White House economic policy official said Biden will probably have no choice but to make that clearer. \u201cMy guess is that it will be inescapable, and inadvisable, for him to not talk about the need to have exceptional scrutiny on some of the excesses and misbehavior,\u201d the former official said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/43/fd/bfccee4e4c148898a8639ce69e03/191016-biden-warren-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
