Lesson Plan breaks it down for us:\n\nIn the game of Hangman, when a child misses a letter of the secret word, you draw a circle (representing the head) in the noose. That\u2019s followed by a long stick (the body), two sticks (the arms), two sticks (the legs), two eyes, and a sad face. That\u2019s a total of nine mistakes. When you play Snowman, for the first incorrect answer the lower (and biggest) snowball is drawn, for the second the middle snowball is added, and for the third a snowball is added at the top (the head of the snowman). After that, the snowman gets two sticks (the arms), a top hat (like the one Frosty the Snowman wears), two eyes, and a sad face. Voila! Nine mistakes!\n\nYou can stick with just the nine items, or you could have fun with it and get as detailed as you want. I remember adding clothing and shoes to my hangmen during particularly epic rounds \u2014 wow am I cringing at myself \u2014 and you could do the same by adding a scarf, buttons and a carrot nose to your snowmen.\n\nAnother (non-wintery) option is \u201cSpaceman,\u201d in which players draw a spaceship. You could also come up with your own character \u2014 draw a \u201cMonster Man,\u201d for example, if snowmen and spaceships are a little too cute for your kids.", "description": "Back in the day, when we found ourselves in a situation in which we had to pass some time \u2014 which was often, because no cell phones \u2014 we practiced our spelling skills by hanging stick figures....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rljdkfqv3xgnyj2gzcyu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
