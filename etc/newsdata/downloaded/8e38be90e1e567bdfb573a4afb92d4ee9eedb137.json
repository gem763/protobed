Fisher, they say, has a reputation for off-color and misogynistic remarks, as well as repeated comments questioning the abolition of slavery. HuffPost granted two subjects anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nAfter the San Francisco conference, attendees said they were disgusted as the 68-year-old investor spoke freely about his business dealings in sexist terms, comparing winning clients to \u201cgoing up to a woman in a bar and saying, hey, I want to talk about what\u2019s in your pants.\u201d\n\nKenneth Fisher, the founder, chairman and CEO of Fisher Investments, speaks at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York on Dec. 5, 2011.

Alex Chalekian, a registered investment advisor who tweeted out a two-minute video about Fisher\u2019s comments at the Tiburon CEO Summit, mentioned at the end of his viral clip that he\u2019d heard from one of Fisher\u2019s past employees \u201cthat he had made the comment to them talking about the fact that he thinks that slavery should have never been abolished.\u201d\n\nThat allegation appears to have hit a nerve. Former colleagues of Fisher\u2019s told HuffPost they aren\u2019t surprised by the comments and that they\u2019d heard his line about slavery before. Others said it fit in line with the CEO\u2019s way of speaking \u2015 sometimes billed as \u201ceccentric,\u201d \u201codd\u201d and \u201ccolorful\u201d \u2015 code for what many called misogynistic and racist remarks.\n\nFisher\u2019s views on slavery are relatively out in the open. He even tweeted aboutit last year, declaring Abraham Lincoln his least favorite president because he believes emancipation was a poor economic choice. Forbes first published the tweets earlier this week.\n\n\u201c[Economist] Douglass C. North proved slavery was profitable at the time of the war,\u201d Fisher tweeted last year. \u201cWait 30 years and technology would have rendered it profitless and slavery would have fallen peacefully and had it African Americans and everyone today would be hugely better off.\u201d\n\nDouglas C.
