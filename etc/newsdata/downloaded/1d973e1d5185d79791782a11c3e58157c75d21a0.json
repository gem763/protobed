I don\u2019t mean to badmouth my colleague. I do not know him, but the legal representative, even from the court documents, admitted in court that criminal practice only constitutes 20% of his practice.\u201d\n\nSteyl said the previous counsel made numerous errors, including interrupting the magistrate.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know the processes, he didn\u2019t know the day periods. He absolutely knew nothing. He convinced Kanya to plead guilty without explaining the consequences of pleading guilty,\u201d Steyl added.\n\nHe said the state was not able to prove its criminal element.\n\n\u201cHad he not pleaded guilty he wouldn\u2019t be in jail today because the state would not have been able to prove the elements. They would not have been able to convict him of setting the police van on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Footprint Media Academy student has spent two years of his five-year jail term in Leeuwkop prison.\n\nSettlement agreement\n\nThe court appearance began at 10am and was adjourned shortly after the state indicated that it had not filed its papers.\n\nAt 2pm the court resumed, and a settlement agreement was reached between Cekeshe\u2019s legal team and the National Prosecuting Authority.\n\nThe agreement concluded that the NPA would cooperate by accompanying Cekeshe\u2019s legal representatives on October 1 and 2 to the Johannesburg Magistrates\u2019 Court to secure a date for the hearing of the application for bail pending the appeal.\n\nCekeshe\u2019s legal team said they hoped that the matter would be heard as soon as Friday.\n\n\u201cToday we brought an urgent bail application after getting nowhere with the NPA. We were forced to bring it urgently and luckily we got answers from the NPA and the court today. They have agreed to assist us to bring his bail application, they will reconstruct the missing transcripts and they will requisition Kanya to come to court hopefully as soon as Friday\u201d, Steyl said.\n\nFree Kanya\n\nCrowds of students, members of the public and Economic Freedom Fighters members of Parliament were present at the court appearance.\n\nEFF MP Kenny Motsamai told City Press he had raised Cekeshe\u2019s matter with the minister of justice and correctional services, Ronald Lamola, and would follow up after the court outcome.\n\nMotsamai added that he would also help Cekeshe request a presidential pardon.\n\nLeading the crowd, the president of the EFF student command Mandla Shikwambana said the sentencing of the Fees Must fall activist was unjust and unfair.\n\n\u201cThere are many activists whose cases were dismissed, some have been given suspended sentences while others are on house arrest. Why was his matter treated differently? As the student command we are here to ask that the court treat Kanya in the same manner as other convicted activists. He was fighting a just cause, one which has not been fully realised, and others have become beneficiaries of it. So why should he languish in jail?\u201d", "description": "The legal representatives of Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe believe that his previous legal team misled him and he should not have pleaded guilty because the state had no evidence of any wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Zamayirha Peter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8505/e64a82b03f464a08ae28021dc8755e67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
