I find the media reaction from 'our very own' quite disrespectful... talk about kicking someone when they're down.\n\n\"All the incredible achievements over three years instantly overshadowed by a poor (RWC) season. Athletes don\u2019t go out trying to under-perform, they're human and with that comes failure. I suppose it\u2019s too much for some to understand the demands of performing at such high levels consistently.\"\n\nIn response to a South African rugby scribe who suggested CJ Stander had gone \"missing\" in the quarter-final against New Zealand, she wrote: \"CJ with the most carries and second most metres made of the Irish team. Most tackles (of everyone on the pitch) made with none missed?! Given it doesn\u2019t show on the scoreboard but it\u2019s too easy to say someone is missing when the whole team is under-performing.\"\n\nAll the incredible achievements over 3 years instantly overshadowed by a poor (RWC) season.Athletes don\u2019t go out trying to underperform,they\u2019re human & with that comes failure,I suppose its too much for some to understand the demands of performing at such high levels consistently \u2014 Jean-Mari\u00e9 Stander (@JMNeethling) October 21, 2019\n\nAs if it isn\u2019t gutting enough for the players\u2019 & coaches\u2019 hard work & sacrifices over 4+ years not to be reflected in their overall performance this year... i find the media reaction from \u201cour very own\u201d quite disrespectful... talk about kicking someone when they\u2019re down. \u2014 Jean-Mari\u00e9 Stander (@JMNeethling) October 21, 2019\n\nCJ with the most carries & second most metres made of the Irish team.
