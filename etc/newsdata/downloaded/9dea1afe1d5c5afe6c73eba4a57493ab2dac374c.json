I've said for some time, over and over again, I would campaign for Remain so obviously I'm disappointed by the result [but] sometimes we obscure the progress we've made by getting too hung up on this particular vote,\" Starmer said.\n\nMembers instead endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's policy of renegotiating a Brexit deal before holding a referendum, then holding a special conference to decide on the party's stance in the referendum \u2014 whether to back their new deal, or back staying in the EU.\n\nCorbyn has suggested he could remain neutral on the question, a stance Starmer said he had \"mixed feelings\" about.\n\n\"Brexit is a very very difficult issue for the Labour Party,\" he said. \"What Jeremy's trying to achieve, in fairness is \u2014 given the divisions across the country \u2014 somebody's got to be prepared to say: 'We'll have a referendum to find a way through and I'll stay above that' ... I personally think it's better to campaign for Remain and that's what I've said. I don't think there is a deal that's going to be as good as the deal we've got.\"\n\nPredicting the outcome of any special conference on Brexit, Starmer said: \"I think it is very likely that the members will want us to campaign for Remain ... it seems to me obvious where the membership is on this.\"\n\nIn his speech to Labour conference, Starmer said Labour, if it was in government, would legislate to hold a referendum within six months.", "description": "Labour members voted against a motion which would have seen the party commit to backing Remain in a second vote.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169972804-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
