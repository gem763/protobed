The answer was delivered forcefully and emphatically in the 20th minute at Old Trafford.\n\nNot many people get the better of Virgil van Dijk, let alone dump Liverpool\u2019s man mountain on his backside, but that\u2019s exactly what Rashford did here.\n\nThe two men chased to compete for a ball in front of the dugouts and Van Dijk was the favourite to win the contest. He usually is. Suddenly, though, he was toppling over the touchline and the Manchester United striker was running off with the ball at his feet.\n\nMarcus Rashford celebrates after opening the scoring in the first half at Old Trafford\n\nMarcus Rashford finishes beyond Alisson to give Manchester United the lead against Liverpool\n\n\u2018You can see the boy is growing and getting stronger,\u2019 smiled Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he discussed the incident afterwards.\n\n\u2018It was the best game he\u2019s played for ages and the best in his 10 months with me.\u2019\n\nThe 21-year-old is no longer a boy. He has bulked up since emerging on the scene in 2016 and developed broad shoulders, both physically and metaphorically. Not many men his age are asked to lead the line at a club of United\u2019s stature.\n\nThe 21-year-old forward listens to advice from manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nHe has struggled under the burden at times. His body language around Carrington recently has not gone unnoticed and it has carried over onto the pitch.\n\nRashford is no longer an automatic starter for England despite his excellent goal against Bulgaria last week.\n\n\u2018I thought he looked beat two weeks ago,\u2019 commented Gary Neville yesterday. \u2018I felt he needed to come out of the team.\n\n\u2018But the international break has done him good. He looked like himself.\u2019\n\nMarcus Rashford embraces Red Devils team-mate Anthony Martial after being substituted\n\nHe didn\u2019t make the most positive of starts either. When the ball broke for Rashford close to halfway with open space ahead of him, instead of seizing the chance to attack he held out his hands in desperation and passed it back to his defence.\n\nThen after Andreas Pereira drilled a low cross to the penalty spot, Rashford was flat footed as the ball was easily clear to safety.\n\nIt was exactly the kind of moment Alan Shearer highlighted when he criticised the striker\u2019s lack of movement in United\u2019s defeat to West Ham last month.\n\nWhen opportunity knocked again in the 36th minute, however, Rashford was alive to it.\n\nReferee Martin Atkinson gestures to confirm Sadio Mane's goal has been ruled out for handball\n\nDan James crossed from the right and he made for the near post before checking his run to duck back behind Joel Matip. The ball reached Rashford in front of goal and there was never a chance he would miss from there.\n\n\u2018We had a little video session yesterday and exactly that happened,\u2019 said Solskjaer.\n\nIt was only Rashford\u2019s fourth goal of the season for United and his second from open play, which tells its own story.\n\nSadio Mane thought he had equalised when he fired beyond David de Gea in the first half\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the man who also scored twice against Liverpool here in March 2018 has a better strike rate against the established top six than the smaller clubs.\n\nHe was a real handful for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s on Sunday, and so too was James as United played two up front but asked them to stay as wide as possible.\n\nLiverpool didn\u2019t know quite how to pick them up and were vulnerable to their pace on the break.\n\nRashford was inches away from a crucial second goal in the 67th minute but dragged his shot wide before he was replaced by Anthony Martial.\n\nAdam Lallana celebrates after popping up at the back post to score Liverpool's equaliser\n\nThe Frenchman\u2019s return from injury after nearly eight weeks out will lift some of the burden off Rashford.\n\nThe decision not to sign a replacement for either Romelu Lukaku or Alexis Sanchez in the summer has not been kind to him.\n\nHis former manager Jose Mourinho claimed on Sky Sports yesterday that Rashford can\u2019t get better as a target man. Neville disagreed.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s still young,\u2019 he said. \u2018Players have to develop. United have to make a decision. They have to buy but not necessarily at the expense of Marcus Rashford. Of course, he needs help.\u2019", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER AT OLD TRAFFORD: Was Marcus Rashford up for this one?
