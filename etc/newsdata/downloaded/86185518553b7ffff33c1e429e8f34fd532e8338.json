(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nThe dress code memo to students and parents at a suburban Maryland high school didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination.\n\n\u201cSkirts and dresses must not show private areas when sitting, walking, climbing stairs or doing normal school activities,\u201d the new principal at Albert Einstein High School, Christine C. Handy, wrote in an email last week. \u201cShorts must not expose private areas when sitting, walking, climbing stairs, or doing normal school activities.\u201d\n\nAlso forbidden: \u201cBandeaus, backless tops, exposed midriffs, or visible undergarments.\u201d\n\nThe missive on what\u2019s appropriate for students to wear received a mixed reaction from students and parents at the Montgomery County public school. Some supported Handy\u2019s effort to target clothing they said is more appropriate for the beach or the boardwalk than a classroom. Many others argued the new standards are sexist, ill-conceived and impossible to enforce fairly.\n\nThe issue has percolated on group texts and social media platforms in the past week, and students launched at least two petitions calling for Handy to reconsider the policy. Last week, some of those students protested at the school by dressing in just the manner the new policy proscribes.\n\n\u201cThey broke the dress code, but it was within reason. They were not being super inappropriate,\u201d said a junior girl who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about the issue outside the Kensington school.\n\nHandy\u2019s email about the dress code noted that T-shirts invoking inappropriate language, gangs, sexual innuendos or weapons are banned. But this is what irked many students: The bulk of the message focused on what was not acceptable for girls to wear at school.\n\nDress codes and their enforcement have long been an issue as every generation of students tests the boundaries of appropriateness and pushes back against what it feels are overly restrictive policies. But how dress codes are enforced has become increasingly controversial.\n\nIn a recent report, the National Women\u2019s Law Center found that among 29 D.C. schools, there were more dress code restrictions in majority-black high schools than other high schools. And public charter schools in the District had, on average, more than twice the number of dress code restrictions as traditional public schools in the 2018-2019 school year.\n\nIn response, some D.C. students have organized walkouts and met with school leaders to address what they see as unfair implementation and enforcement of dress code policies.\n\n\u201cEspecially in this #MeToo movement that we\u2019re in, schools shouldn\u2019t be teaching students that it\u2019s okay to scrutinize girls\u2019 bodies \u2026 or make them feel like they have to cover up or feel less than,\u201d Nia Evans, author and lead researcher of the women\u2019s law center report, told The Washington Post earlier this month.\n\nHandy defended the new dress code in a statement she sent in response to a Washington Post query.\n\n\u201cThe Albert Einstein High School guidelines, which were created in collaboration with students leaders and are aligned with [school system] policy, provide greater clarity for students and staff and ensure that expectations are universally understood and applied,\u201d Handy wrote. \u201cI truly value student voice and believe that a student-informed policy for dress is important. I plan to meet with additional students in the coming weeks and months to discuss any concerns or questions they may have.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Montgomery County Public Schools, Derek G. Turner, said campuses have flexibility to determine a dress code.\n\nA number of students interviewed at the school, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the matter, said the new rules target girls and could cause body image issues.\n\n\u201cWhat clothing exactly constitutes \u2018too much information?\u2019 \u201d a senior girl asked. \u201cBody types are different, and it could single out girls who are a certain body type. And that\u2019s not a particularly good message to send out to young females.\u201d\n\nAnd, students said, they worry that enforcement of the dress code will be arbitrary.\n\n\u201cIt becomes about teachers using their judgment about what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s inappropriate, and that in itself is kind of gross,\u201d another junior girl said.\n\nNot all students oppose the rules. Wendy Ramirez, a senior, said she didn\u2019t have any problem with the new policy.\n\n\u201cSome of what the girls wear is inappropriate,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\n\u201cYou can see everything!\u201d a friend chimed in.\n\nRamirez agreed that girls should not be singled out though. \u201cSome guys\u2019 pants are too low, and that is not appropriate either,\u201d she said.\n\nEinstein students said the school last year followed the Montgomery County system\u2019s dress code guidelines but that they were rarely enforced. The new code was presented to students in assemblies this month.\n\nParents have also been debating the clothing edict. Many have weighed in on a school email group.\n\nLiz Brent, whose daughter attends Einstein, said she\u2019s not opposed to a dress code, but thinks it should be a systemwide policy, one that spells out in detail not only what is considered a violation but how those transgressions will be enforced. She said she doesn\u2019t want the policing of attire to land on teachers who have more important things to worry about.\n\n\u201cIt would take a full-time employee at any high school to manage this,\u201d Brent said in an interview. Instead, she recommended that Montgomery County schools adopt the dress code from the neighboring Howard County school system, which includes a detailed policy statement and implementation procedures. By contrast, the Montgomery County dress code is just a paragraph long.\n\nFelicia Lulli, who also has a daughter at Einstein, said she doesn\u2019t want the dress code to become a burden on the faculty either, but she thinks students should see school as a place where they are held to a high standard.\n\n\u201cDifferent clothes are appropriate in different places,\u201d Lulli said. \u201cOf course, no girls should be shamed or embarrassed, but all workplaces have dress codes, and I think students also need to know how to dress for school.\u201d\n\nGet updates on your area delivered via email\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Some students and parents say the Einstein High guidelines unfairly target girls.", "authors": ["Joe Heim", "Reporter Covering A Range Of Topics", "Including Race", "Schools", "Student Culture", "White Nationalism", "Native American Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sgz9Ev6tUr5sEFmmvZjIv56LBrI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IBEMWIBZBUI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
