In November, when she was a ninth grader, Thunberg staged a strike for two weeks outside the Swedish parliament, demanding that the government cut emissions by 15% a year.\n\nNow Thunberg spends every Friday on strike.\n\nOn Monday, Thunberg gave an impassioned, tearful speech to world leaders at the UN Climate Action Summit.\n\n\"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nTo get to the UN event, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic on a zero-emissions boat to avoid the carbon emissions that would have come from flying.\n\nRead More: Here's what 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg's zero-emissions journey from Europe to New York looked like.\n\nHere's how Thunberg rose to prominence as the face of a new movement.\n\nOn Monday, Thunberg joined two other youth activists in opening the UN Climate Action Summit.

How dare you!\"\n\nFor four minutes, Thunberg held the room in thrall as she chastised leaders for talking about \"money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth\" while people suffer.\n\n\"People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing,\" Thunberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThunberg has been thinking about climate change \u2014 and the lack of action to curb it \u2014 since age 8, when she first learned about the problem. She has said she didn't understand why adults weren't working to mitigate its effects.", "description": "Greta Thunberg has met with world leaders, led climate strikes, sailed across the Atlantic, and been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2vu_R8P0uUvFCTphqWdp3g--~B/aD0xNjQ1O3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/26ce85cf4cb9885cf117d2b8dee3483c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
