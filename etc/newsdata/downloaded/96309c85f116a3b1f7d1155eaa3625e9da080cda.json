( CVS ) is looking up lately. Prices are creeping higher from a five-month base pattern but will resistance around $66 cap the upside? Let's check out the charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CVS, below, we can see a \"saucer-like\" base pattern from March through July. The 50-day moving average line makes a rounded turn from down to up and the trading volume dries up in May and June at the bottom of the saucer.\n\nRecently prices closed above the bottoming 200-day moving average line and look like they will make a new high for the move up today.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line was flat from March to early August but it has since improved.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line in buy territory.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of CVS, below, we can see that prices are still in a longer-term downtrend but have closed above the bearish 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has inched up from late February and the MACD oscillator is getting closer to crossing back above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CVS, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $73. A decline back down to $57.49 will weaken this chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: CVS is pointed up but there is a band of resistance around $66 that could get in the way of reaching the Point and Figure target of $73.", "description": "Let's check out the charts....CVS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Charts Of Cvs Health Are Coming Out Of Rehab", "Let'S Check Out The Charts.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Helene Meisler", "Eric Jhonsa", "Kevin Curran"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c4fa35f1-ce69-11e8-ade1-9ff2b03b8102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
