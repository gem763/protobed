(Wilfredo Lee/AP)\n\nFollowing a Sunday rout of the Miami Dolphins that saw quarterback Lamar Jackson tie the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 franchise record with five touchdown passes, the 22-year-old was asked if his performance would be enough to silence those who say he\u2019s incapable of throwing the ball at an NFL level.\n\nDonning a wry smile, Jackson quipped back with the same phrase some critics have used to discredit him.\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut not bad for a running back.\u201d\n\nFor those who believe in his passing abilities, Jackson\u2019s Sunday outing was as impressive as it was cathartic. He completed 85 percent of his 20 passes for 324 yards, and his perfect 158.3 passer rating was also a first in Ravens franchise history. The four touchdown passes he threw in the first half were two shy of his total from last season.\n\nJackson throughout his rookie year was ridiculed for his arm as often as he was lauded for his stellar running ability. His shaky performance against the Los Angeles Chargers in last year\u2019s playoffs served as more fodder for detractors, and some pundits suggested the dual-threat quarterback was not fit to play the position at all.\n\nBut the perception that Jackson wouldn\u2019t last as an NFL quarterback dates back to his days at Louisville. In early 2018, former Indianapolis Colts general manager Bill Polian famously said Jackson, who is 6-foot-2, was too short and not accurate enough to play the position at the pro level \u2014 even though Jackson won the Heisman Trophy in 2016.\n\n[Lamar Jackson and the Ravens looked great. The Dolphins? Not so much.]\n\n\u201cI think wide receiver,\u201d Polian, now an ESPN analyst, replied when asked which position Jackson should play in the NFL. \u201cExceptional athlete, exceptional ability to make you miss, exceptional acceleration, exceptional instinct with the ball in his hand, and that\u2019s rare for wide receivers.\"\n\nPolian, who had previously said Jackson \u201cmight be a receiver,\u201d went on to compare the quarterback to star wideouts Antonio Brown and Julio Jones.\n\nThat same year, ESPN football analyst Mel Kiper Jr. cited Jackson\u2019s \u201caccuracy throwing the football\u201d in college as evidence he shouldn\u2019t be taken in the first round of the NFL draft. (Jackson was taken with the last pick in the first round.) And in 2017, Sports Illustrated quoted an anonymous ACC coach who said Jackson \u201chas no shot at playing quarterback in the NFL.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone. He can\u2019t make the throws and can\u2019t read coverages,\u201d the coach told SI. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to have a chance.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday, the Ravens dominated thanks to Jackson\u2019s arm. He dazzled with an array of throws, including this impressive, backpedaling toss to rookie wide receiver Miles Boykin in the end zone:\n\nUpdated Lamar Jackson stats: 9/9, 204 yards, 4 TDs\n\n\n\nMiles Boykin gets in on the actionpic.twitter.com/ieNNjDynoU \u2014 NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) September 8, 2019\n\nDespite Jackson\u2019s desire to rely on his passing abilities this season, many headlines coming into Week 1 focused on his proficient running ability. Some pundits even predicted he would break Michael Vick\u2019s famous 2006 single-season quarterback rushing record of 1,039 yards.\n\nOn Sunday, however, Jackson ran three times for six yards \u2014 fewer than Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick gained on his single carry.\n\nWith the Ravens up 42, Lamar Jackson is on the bench. He might have authored the best performance by a Ravens QB ever:\n\n\n\n\u2060\u2014 324 yards (career high)\n\n\u2060\u2014 5 TDs (tied franchise record)\n\n\u2060\u2014 85.0% accuracy (franchise record)\n\n\u2060\u2014 Perfect 158.3 passer rating (1st in franchise history) \u2014 Jonas Shaffer (@jonas_shaffer) September 8, 2019\n\nThe Ravens will probably go as far this season as Jackson can take them, and while he won\u2019t have to repeat Sunday\u2019s performance every week, he\u2019ll also have to prove that this outburst against a woeful Dolphins squad wasn\u2019t a complete outlier.\n\nIf Week 1 is any indication of what\u2019s to come, however, it might time for Jackson\u2019s doubters to finally back off.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nHow Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL\u2019s most anticipated QB\n\nDak Prescott is next in line for a big contract from the Cowboys.
