Not coincidentally, Stern, who is currently an executive-in-residence at the University of Massachusetts, gave a speech last night saying almost the same thing:\n\n\u201cEveryone got it wrong,\u201d Stern said Wednesday\u2026 \u201cThe NBA has gotten a very difficult rap the last few days, because it is being reported that it actually apologized to the Chinese for the tweet by Daryl Morey of Houston,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in fact it never did. Adam Silver said that he regretted that our Chinese fans were upset by that, but that\u2019s the way it is in America. You educate yourself and you go ahead and tweet. And we have free speech here.\u201d\u2026 The 77-year-old Stern, who served as commissioner for three decades until 2014, said he was ultimately \u201cvery proud of the way the NBA has handled itself\u201d in the midst of such a high-profile international dispute.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the initial statement didn\u2019t contain the word \u201capologize,\u201d but the point of the statement was to express regret that \u201cfriends and fans in China\u201d were \u201cdeeply offended\u201d over Morey\u2019s support for Hong Kong\u2019s independence. That certainly makes it sound as if they are sorry about it.\n\nBut the new version of reality being offered by Silver and Stern also fails to mention a couple of other things, starting with the fact that the NBA published two different versions of the statement, one in English and one in Mandarin for Chinese fans. As the Associated Press pointed out, the two statements were very different in tone:\n\nA politically charged disagreement over Morey\u2019s tweet that showed support for Hong Kong anti-government protesters got an additional wrinkle when the NBA posted a statement Monday on Weibo \u2014 a Twitter-like microblogging site used in China \u2014 saying the league was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by what it called an \u201cinappropriate\u201d comment. The same post said the NBA\u2019s stance was that Morey\u2019s view \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\u2026 \u201cThere should be no discrepancy on the statement issued last night,\u201d Bass said Monday. \u201cWe have seen various interpretations of the translation of the Mandarin version, but our statement in English is the league\u2019s official statement.\u201d\n\nSilver claims the NBA didn\u2019t apologize to the Chinese government but the Manadarin statement actually echoed the Chinese government:\n\nThe \u201churt feelings\u201d phrase is commonly used by Chinese authorities to describe perceived gaffes by foreign parties. Similar phrasing was used by Mercedes-Benz in February 2018 when it had to apologize for quoting the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post. The auto company apologized for \u201cwrong information\u201d that \u201churt the feelings of Chinese people.\u201d\n\nSilver and Stern also fail to mention the apology to China by James Harden: \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there.\u201d You can watch the clip below but it kinda-sorta sounds as if Harden is apologizing not just on his own behalf but for the league as a whole. Maybe Commissioner Silver rebuked him for that. If so, I missed it.\n\nAll of this together sounds a lot like an apology to me. Was it an apology to the Chinese government or just to fans? Are we supposed to pretend the NBA doesn\u2019t know China is a one-party communist dictatorship where every decision about the NBA\u2019s existence in China is up to the government and not the free market? I guess that\u2019s what Silver wants us to pretend but let\u2019s instead assume Silver actually knows who he has to appeased in China. It\u2019s definitely not the fans.\n\nThe moving of the goalposts by Commissioner Silver and former Commissioner Stern means the NBA has finally stopped worrying so much about what China thinks and started worrying more about what Americans (and Canadians) think. They still have a problem here at home where LeBron James-style woke hypocrisy hasn\u2019t gone over well with everyone. Yahoo News reports that Raptors fans are planning a t-shirt giveaway for the team\u2019s season opener next Tuesday:\n\nA group of Canadian fans in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement have raised more than $34,000 to make and distribute as many as 7,000 T shirts to Raptors fans taking in the team\u2019s season opener Tuesday Oct. 2 vs. the New Orleans Pelicans. The group had set up a GoFundMe page earlier in the week in the hopes of procuring enough money to make 5,000 shirts.\n\nHere\u2019s what the shirts will look like:\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be a shame if shirts like this appeared at games around the US? I sure hope that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s happening in LA too:\n\n#HKShirtGiveaway test prints. Getting ready to hand these out at NBA opener in LA Oct 22!
