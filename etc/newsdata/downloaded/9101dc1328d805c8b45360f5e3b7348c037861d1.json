The Arizona Republic | USA TODAY NETWORK won for explanatory reporting for its project \u201cThe Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences,\u201d The Cincinnati Enquirer staff won for local reporting with \u201cSeven Days of Heroin,\u201d and The Des Moines Register\u2019s Andie Dominick won for editorial writing.\n\n\u201cThe Wall\u201d was a landmark multi-platform project that examined President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The explanatory report, led by then Arizona Republic\u2019s vice president of news and editor Nicole Carroll, recently named editor in chief of USA TODAY, provides an in-depth look at the border through immersive technology, including aerial and 360-degree video, virtual reality, bots, drones, documentaries, photos, podcasts, and LiDAR data. The report was published at a crucial time when Congress was considering funding for a border wall and continues to inform policy discussions.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize board named \u201cThe Wall\u201d a winner \u201cfor vivid and timely reporting that masterfully combined text, video, podcasts and virtual reality to examine, from multiple perspectives, the difficulties and unintended consequences of fulfilling President Trump's pledge to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven Days of Heroin: This is What an Epidemic Looks Like,\u201d shines a spotlight on Cincinnati\u2019s opioid and heroin crisis. Over the course of one week, 60 journalists investigated what has become the region\u2019s greatest health crisis, during which they reported 180 overdoses and 18 deaths.\n\nThe board awarded The Cincinnati Enquirer \u201cfor a riveting and insightful narrative and video documenting seven days of greater Cincinnati's heroin epidemic, revealing how the deadly addiction has ravaged families and communities.\u201d\n\nThe Des Moines Register\u2019s Andie Dominick was named 2018 Pulitzer Prize winner for editorial writing about issues in Iowa related to health care, such as the governor\u2019s privatization of Medicaid, state lawmakers\u2019 efforts to impede fetal tissue research, and how the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the Affordable Care Act jeopardizes access to coverage.\n\nThe judges praised Andie Dominick \u201cfor examining in a clear, indignant voice, free of clich\u00e9 or sentimentality, the damaging consequences for poor Iowa residents of privatizing the state\u2019s administration of Medicaid.\u201d\n\nIn addition, two others earned honors as Pulitzer Prize finalists. They are:\n\nBrett Murphy of USA TODAY NETWORK, for \u201cRigged: Forced in Debt. Worked Past Exhaustion. Left with Nothing,\u201d in the National Reporting category. This yearlong investigation found that port trucking companies in southern California have spent the past decade forcing drivers to finance their own trucks by taking on debt they could not afford.\n\nMike Thompson of the Detroit Free Press, for Editorial Cartooning. Mike\u2019s work offers commentary on politics, news, current events and pop culture. The Pulitzer judges said Mike created \u201ca provocative, nuanced and impactful portfolio of editorial cartoons that took on a variety of social issues, including, health care, police brutality, sexual harassment and education, through traditional panels and digital animation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s tremendous accomplishment of winning three Pulitzer Prizes and being recognized as finalists in two other categories underscores the value of the journalism put forth by our newsrooms across the country,\u201d said Robert J. Dickey, president and CEO, Gannett. \u201cOur journalists earned such prestigious honors because of the impact that their hard work had from the local to national level, and that result is the goal media organizations strive to achieve every day. Today is a cause for celebration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of the work of the USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s journalists and honored by the Pulitzer Board\u2019s recognition of their incredible feats of journalism in 2017,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president, USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher, USA TODAY. \u201cTo have five Network teams be recognized by the Pulitzer Prize board is a reflection of the ambition, impact and excellence of our journalism. Most importantly, the work cited brought illumination to complex and troubling issues, helped to right wrongs, humanized some of the greatest challenges faced by our nation and served as a catalyst for vital dialogue.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qBAmWx", "description": "The USA TODAY NETWORK is celebrating three 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in the categories of explanatory journalism, editorial writing, and local reporting.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
