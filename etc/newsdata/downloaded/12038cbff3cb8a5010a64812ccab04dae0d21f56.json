At another he describes his attempt to get into the synagogue in Halle as a \u201chundred per cent fail\u201d.\n\nPeople light candles at the market place near to the scene of a shooting on October 9 Credit: Getty Images Europe More\n\n\u201cAt least I\u2019ve proved homemade weapons are useless,\u201d he says towards the end, after his gun jams repeatedly.\n\nThe video, originally live streamed on the gaming site Twitch, reportedly remained available om on Thursday and had attracted thousands of views despite attempts to take it down.\n\nA manifesto in which Balliert announced his plan to attack synagogue on a German message board a week in advance also remained online.\n\nThe manifesto appears to indicate that Balliert built a home-made gun to plans put online by Philip Luty, a pro-gun activist from Yorkshire who died in 2011.\n\nThe documents suggest Baillert wanted to prove \"the viability of improvised guns\" and encourage copycats.\n\nThe gun, which failed repeatedly, was only one of the elements of his plan that went wrong. It is clear Balliert planned a massacre at the Halle synagogue, which was packed with 70 worshippers marking Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.\n\nBut from the start, things started to go wrong for the would-be mass murderer. \u201cI hope the door is open,\u201d he says on the video footage, before arriving to find it locked.\n\nHe then attempts to blow it open using homemade explosives, but fails. The worshippers inside, alerted by the sound of the blast, barricaded themselves in to prevent him gaining entry.\n\nEventually Balliert gives up and returns to his car. A woman carrying a heavy backpack doesn\u2019t notice his gun and expresses annoyance that the car is blocking the pavement. He guns her down in cold blood.\n\nHe then drives to a kebab shop where hs shoots dead a random customer. It appears his plan was to die in a shoot-out with police. As a police car approaches, he tells the camera: \u201cNow I die\u201d.\n\nBut even at that, Balliert failed.", "description": "The terror attack by a far-Right gunman on a\u00a0crowded synagogue in Germany\u00a0might have been far more devastating if he hadn\u2019t used a homemade gun built to British blueprints, it emerged on Thursday.
