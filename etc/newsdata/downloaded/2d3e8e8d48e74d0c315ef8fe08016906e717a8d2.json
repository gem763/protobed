The playful piano music almost provides a kind of insight into the goose\u2019s mind \u2014 the melody plays in quiet, short bursts when it\u2019s up to no good, creeping up on its next victim. When the goose is in full chaos mode, waddling away from the gardener who just wants his keys back, the piano tune plays out in full, encouraging the player to keep up the shenanigans.\n\nSurprisingly, the studio had originally leaned toward having no music in the game until the first trailer was released in 2017. Composer Dan Golding, who previously worked with the studio for the soundtrack of its debut title Push Me Pull You, was brought on to score the trailer, which features Debussy\u2019s \u201cPrelude No. 12: Minstrels.\u201d But it was edited in such a way that the music begins when the goose grabs the gardener\u2019s radio, and when the trailer immediately went viral, it struck a chord with people.\n\n\u201cPlease tell me the musical score is dynamic and situational aware, and not just in the video? That would make this game the best thing,\u201d a commenter wrote, with numerous others in agreement. The reactions to the music in the trailer were so strong that the studio felt it needed to oblige. \u201cWe all got together and were sort of like, \u2018Well, we gotta figure out how to do this,\u2019\u201d Golding says.\n\nTo start, Golding began by recording two versions of the \u201cPrelude\u201d: one played normally, and one with a much lower, softer energy. The tracks were then split up into different \u201cstems,\u201d or sections, at the same parts. Though he began by splitting the song into about 60 stems, it didn\u2019t prove to be enough. \u201cThe game would start up and bulldoze through the kind of micro-narratives of the game, so I was like, let me see if I can brute force this,\u201d he says.\n\nRead next: Untitled Goose Game review\n\nUsing Logic, he split up the song into two beats, ending up at about 400 stems. And although the notes can sometimes cut off midway through musical phrases, the songs avoid sounding chopped up through the use of reverb. \u201cI exported each of these stems so that the reverb rings out as much as it can,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of these stems, they\u2019re not the same length, even though they\u2019re the same musical length. You can play them over the top of each other, and it just sounds like the piano is holding down the sustain pedal.\u201d\n\nThe stems were then matched up to the game, which operates in three states: the first is a silent state, where the goose is just hanging out, not doing anything; in the second state, the \u201clow energy version\u201d is performed as the goose is plotting and scheming, moving closer to his prey; and the third state is when you\u2019re being actively chased, which is the performance you\u2019d hear on a record. The game chooses which version to play depending on what\u2019s happening \u2014 so taking into account all the different ways the stems can be matched together, that means the amount of different versions you can hear is \u201ca number with, like, 52 zeroes,\u201d Golding says. \u201cOne of the beauties of the game is that nobody\u2019s gonna get the same performance.\u201d\n\nReactive soundtrack of the year. pic.twitter.com/b58WxkILRF \u2014 Gareth Damian Martin (@JumpOvertheAge) September 23, 2019\n\nUntitled Goose Game was able to make use of six of Debussy\u2019s Preludes thanks to copyright laws, which dictate that tracks become public domain 70 years after the death of the composer. \u201cThis is why the copyright system exists to expire. In 2019, it opens it up for people to experiment and play, and give different context to such vital pieces of music,\u201d he says.\n\nSince different recordings of Debussy are already available, if an Untitled Goose Game soundtrack were to be released, Golding says he\u2019d release a curated set of tracks incorporating his slower, low-energy performances with the more normal sections. He\u2019s also considering releasing the music from the gardener\u2019s radio, which are six original compositions spanning different genres \u2014 tracks that are \u201cirritating enough that you\u2019d understand why the gardener would rush to turn it off, but not irritating enough that the player actually gets irritated.\u201d", "description": "One of the highlights of House House\u2019s Untitled Goose Game, the \"slapstick-stealth-sandbox\" game in which you play a terrible goose wreaking havoc in a lovely English village, is the adaptive soundtrack of Debussy\u2019s Preludes.
