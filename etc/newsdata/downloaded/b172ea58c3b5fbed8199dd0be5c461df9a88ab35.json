Meanwhile, futures for the S&P 500 index were up 6.75 points, or 0.2%, at 3,007.50, while Nasdaq-100 futures were gaining 44.5 points, or 0.6%, at 7,934.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow rose 227.61 points, or 0.9%, to 27,137.04, closing above 27,000 for the first time since July.

The bank said rates would remain at \"present or lower levels\" until the inflation outlook \"robustly\" converges with its target of just below 2%.\n\nU.S. stock-index futures added modestly to their gains following the announcement.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the effects of negative rates on bank profitability, the central bank introduced a system of tiered rates that will exempt some bank reserves held at the bank. ECB President Mario Draghi elaborated on the moves at a news conference which began at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn the international trade front, Trump said tariff hikes--from 25% to 30%--that were scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 will now go into effect Oct. 15. The president attributed the \"gesture of goodwill\", as he described it via Twitter (link), to the People's Republic's 70th anniversary commencing on Oct. 1. and came at the request of China's chief trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nThe moves come as American and Chinese representatives are slated to meet in early October to restart stalled trade negotiations and avert any further escalation of animosities between the economic superpowers.\n\nNo date has been set to begin the high-level trade discussions, but the latest olive branch does help to reflect a momentary softening of tensions between Beijing and Washington, which had rattled global economies, because an outright trade war could further weaken an already slowing global economy.\n\n\"The S&P 500 has now fully retraced the August pullback, and in doing so has priced in a lasting U.S.-China trade truce and aggressive [global] central bank easing ... and no more geopolitical surprises,\" wrote Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report in a Thursday note to clients.\n\n\"Proof of that is evident in the lack of a rally despite the short tariff delay announcement,\" he added. \"At these levels, a trade \"truce\" (so no more tariffs) is mostly priced into stocks, just a delay won't be a positive catalyst--the market already expects more.\"\n\nRead: The ECB's challenge: Pushing rates further into negative territory without wrecking eurozone banks (link)\n\nInvestors were also watching new economic data which showed the number of Americans applying for new unemployment benefits fell by 15,000 to 204,000 during the week ended Sept. 7 (link), below economists expectations of 213,000, according to a MarketWatch poll.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index rose 0.1% in August, in line with expectations, while core inflation rose 0.3%, above forecasts of a 0.2% gain. The year-over-year rise in consumer prices (link) advanced to 2.4%, matching a 13-month high.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Oracle Corp. (ORCL) are in focus after the technology company late Wednesday (link) said co-CEO Mark Hurd was taking a leave of absence for health reasons, while announcing that fiscal first quarter revenue grew short of Wall Street estimates.

(T) fell 0.8% in premarket action, after the telecom giant flagged low upgrade rates (link) as a potential threat to revenue in the third quarter, while projecting WarnerMedia revenues to fall roughly $400 million, as \"a number of second-half 2018 hit movies\" poses challenges to year-over-year growth.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 5.6 basis points to 1.68% Thursday after the ECB decision.\n\nIn commodity markets, the price of crude oil was off 1.6% to about $55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling more than 2% on Wednesday amid reports that Trump discussed easing of sanctions on Iran (link) in a move to secure a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani later this month.\n\nGold prices headed 1.6% higher to roughly $1,527 an ounce.
