(AP) - It\u2019s going on a decade since Nebraska and Colorado went their separate ways because of conference realignment, and current players weren\u2019t born yet or can\u2019t remember when the series was one of the most competitive in the old Big Eight and Big 12.\n\nThe vibe at the Cornhuskers\u2019 weekly media availability Monday was that the rivalry is still alive heading into the teams\u2019 nonconference game in Boulder, Colorado, on Saturday.\n\nNebraska players know their history, and they also went through the emotion of last year\u2019s game in Lincoln. Not only did the Huskers squander a second-half lead and lose, they suspected a knee injury to quarterback Adrian Martinez in the fourth quarter was no accident.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s not a lot of love,\u201d linebacker JoJo Domann said. \u201cBack in the day both teams were pretty good, competing for championships, and I think Nebraska got the better of them. Hopefully, we can keep that trend going here.\u201d\n\nDomann added, \u201cYou treat it like any other game. Nameless, faceless opponent. Yeah, we dislike these guys a little more than some other teams. But we\u2019re going to take it to them Saturday like we would anybody else.\u201d\n\nNo. 24 Nebraska will be playing at Folsom Field for the first time since 2009. The teams\u2019 final game as conference mates was in 2010. The Huskers then headed to the Big Ten and the Buffaloes to the Pac-12.\n\nThe schools signed a contract six years ago to play four games, with CU visiting Lincoln in 2018 and 2024 and the Huskers going to Boulder in 2019 and 2023.\n\nBoth teams opened this season with wins. The Huskers beat South Alabama 35-21, and the Buffaloes beat Colorado State 52-31.\n\nLast year, the Huskers fell behind by two touchdowns, led 28-20 in the third quarter and lost 33-28 on Steven Montez\u2019s touchdown pass to Laviska Shenault Jr. with 1:06 remaining.\n\nNebraska nose guard Darrion Daniels said watching video of the game left him seething. He played for Oklahoma State last year, but his brother Damion was with the Huskers.\n\n\u201cI felt like last year we were the better team,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cAnd then if we were the better team last year, I know we\u2019re the better team this year. I\u2019m just ready to go and kick some (butt), to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nThe injury to Martinez was suspicious, and Nebraska sent video of the play to the Big Ten and Pac-12 offices for review. Coach Scott Frost said last year he suspected the injury occurred in the tackle pile after a short run, citing his view of the play from the sideline and video not available to the public.\n\nOutside linebacker Jacob Callier made the initial hit, and still plays for the Buffs, but Frost has never said who he thought injured Martinez. The Pac-12 did not take disciplinary action. The injury kept Martinez out of the following week\u2019s loss to Troy.\n\nCam Taylor-Britt smiled as he was being asked Monday about the Huskers\u2019 view of the Buffs after what happened to Martinez.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a target on their head,\u201d Taylor-Britt said.\n\nMartinez, who was not sharp in the win over South Alabama, said he hasn\u2019t dwelled on the injury or the circumstances around it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really not too much to remember about it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was unfortunate. It\u2019s football. Injuries are part of the game. I moved on after that.\u201d\n\nFrost grew up in Nebraska and quarterbacked the Huskers against Colorado twice, winning in 1996 and \u201897. He knows emotions run high, but he can do without the trash talk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy about using those types of things as motivation for our team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have motivation enough.\u201d\n\nFrost pointed out that Colorado has a new coaching staff, led by Mel Tucker, and that what happened last year is irrelevant.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Frost said, \u201cI think any time Nebraska plays Colorado, there\u2019s going to be a little more juice on both sides.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's going on a decade since Nebraska and Colorado went their separate ways because of conference realignment, and current players weren't born yet or can't remember when the series was one of the most competitive in the old Big Eight and Big 12.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/nebraska_colorado_week_football_44775_c0-654-3490-2688_s1770x1032.jpg?4afb68e798b8a046ac74a846cd62933c716ebc7c"}
