I received no payment for releasing this photograph,\u201d Adamson said.\n\nTrudeau also explicitly acknowledged his mistakes, going so far as to call Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party and the first person of color to lead a federal political party, to apologize directly.", "description": "The man who gave Time magazine the photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at a school event said on Friday he had no political affiliation nor did he receive any payment for releasing the image.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434643834&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1O5", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
