His March 3 primary with Cisneros in Texas' 28th congressional district will be an early test of how far to the left Democratic voters have moved.\n\n\"The myth that south Texas is conservative is just that, a myth,\" Cisneros said in an interview this month in Laredo.\n\nThe divide highlighted in the Texas race echoes a similar battle playing out in the Democratic presidential nominating contest, where moderates led by former Vice President Joe Biden tussle with progressives Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders over the vision for the party.\n\nCisneros, who has won Warren's endorsement, embraces left-wing causes such as \"Medicare for All,\" which would replace the current patchwork healthcare structure with a single-payer system, and the \"Green New Deal\" that would eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade.\n\nThe daughter of Mexican-American immigrants, Cisneros said that residents in the largely Hispanic district, which is centered in Laredo and stretches from the San Antonio suburbs to the U.S.-Mexico border, are warming to liberal policies. Democrat Hillary Clinton won the district in the 2016 presidential race by 20 percentage points.\n\n\"I haven't had a single person disagree with me on the policies, once you start explaining them,\" Cisneros said, adding that \"Medicare for All\" resonates in a place where many people go into Mexico for cheaper medical care. The district's poverty rate is nearly double the national average.\n\nCuellar, a member of the powerful House appropriations committee, blasted the group backing Cisneros as the \"Justice Socialists.\"\n\nTheir mission could backfire, not only in the Texas district but nationwide in 2020, said Cuellar, who has the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Cheri Bustos, the chairwoman of the House Democrats' campaign arm.\n\nCuellar warns the stances taken by progressives could alienate independent voters. Republican President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election next year, has already sought to demonize the entire Democratic party as too extreme.\n\n\"If we lose the independents because we are far left, then that election in November 2020 is going to go in a direction that we don't want,\" Cuellar said in an interview at a Laredo coffee shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nPARTY PURITY TEST\n\nCuellar questions whether taxpayers can afford a far-reaching healthcare program like \"Medicare for All.\" He doubts south Texas voters would favor the Green New Deal, saying thousands of jobs in the area depend on the oil and gas industry.\n\nEarlier this year, Cuellar voted with Republicans and other moderate Democrats to pass a border aid package without the additional protections for migrant children that liberals had sought.\n\nHe defended his record, which according to the Almanac of American Politics ranks him among the most conservative House Democrats.\n\n\"When you have folks that want to purify the Democratic Party and say the only way you can be a Democrat is to be in our image, that is wrong,\" Cuellar said.\n\nAs an entrenched incumbent, Cuellar has a financial edge over his challenger. He raised $375,582 to Cisneros' $317,760 in the third quarter. He has $3.2 million in cash on hand, more than ten times the amount she has, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "description": "Jessica Cisneros interned for U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar in 2014, and the congressman later wrote letters to help her get into law school.
