Obviously, I\u2019ve known for a long time that this can happen at any time and for any reason. I guess from now on we\u2019ll watch and see what happens.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that his 55,000 readers \u201cgo over to Project Veritas. Follow that. Make sure you\u2019re tweeting it out. Make sure CNN sees it. They are scared to death of what Veritas has.\u201d\n\nMr. Cook said that his alleged infringement of copyright rules came on a parody of a Super Bowl video in which he added roughly five seconds of music not even identified by YouTube\u2019s copyright algorithm.\n\nHe added that he has always complied with Twitter\u2019s terms of service by not reposting anything flagged as a possible copyright violation.\n\n\u201cThe best thing we can all do is [to share] all the Veritas stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cMake sure we hit CNN really, really, really, really hard. Expose CNN.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for making this the shortest permanent suspension in twitter history,\u201d he added on Twitter. \u201cSpecial Thanks to @HumanEvents @JackPosobiec @ali @willchamberlain @JamesOKeefeII and @robbystarbuck. And most importantly all of YOU, my follow count is messed up but hopefully that gets fixed too.\u201d\n\nThe Veritas video in question, one of many to be released by the conservative organization started by James O\u2019Keefe, includes hidden-camera footage of CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra talking about the network\u2019s gun control coverage.\n\nMr. Sierra says in the footage that CNN would cover a story about a white victim in an affluent neighborhood, but that \u201cnobody cares\u201d about individuals shot in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThis is @CNN\u2026\n\n\n\nCNN media coordinator says nobody cares about gang violence that disproportionately affects minorities in Chicago\u2026 \u201cUnless it happens on Cory Booker\u2019s block.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the most honest CNN has ever been#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/Vkw20AFROL \u2014 Carpe Donktum\ud83d\udd39 (@CarpeDonktum) October 14, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
