Imagine the money you\u2019d save if you never bought moisturiser again.\n\n\u2018I have been applying for freebies for a very long time,\u2019 Ana, from Essex, tells LatestDeals.co.uk. \u2018Now that I stay at home, even more than before, especially when my son has his naps!\n\nAna is a mum to two-year-old William (Picture: Ana Maria Macovei)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s something I really enjoy doing. I only apply for the ones I know I would use myself, or I know I can gift to family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I mainly apply on the links shared on Latest Free Stuff group. Freebies range from skincare samples, food and drinks, to baby car seats and other gadgets.\n\n\u2018I have also registered to many product testing sites, such as TryIt sampling, Home Tester Club, Clicks Research, Alba Science and Swift Research.\n\n\u2018Product testing sites often give out full-size products that you can keep in exchange of an honest review. Sometimes they also pay you with Amazon vouchers once you complete a study. I also do surveys \u2013 Populus Live is the main one I use as I feel it pays the most.\u2019\n\nTo be clear, getting a haul of free stuff like Ana\u2019s takes a significant chunk of time out of your day. She recommends signing up for lots of sites that offer samples for review or that alert you of special deals.\n\nAna\u2019s biggest freebie so far has been a mattress and pillow set worth \u00a3800 (Picture: Ana Maria Macovei)\n\nAna applies for freebies every day. Some days are quiet, while other days she\u2019ll be lucky and get six or seven offers in a day.\n\nAnd a lot of that time goes to waste \u2013 not every freebie offer will pay off.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to be ready to get a lot of emails \u2013 Ana says it\u2019s best to set up a distinct email address just for freebie applications so your main inbox doesn\u2019t get flooded.\n\nShe advises: \u2018Stay away from offers that ask you to pay for P&P, unless they are from a reputable company.\n\nThe mum often gets free food (Picture: Ana Maria Macovei)\n\n\u2018Like as many companies as you can on Facebook, and other social media, as you will often get offers to apply for samples and competitions by doing this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Join LatestFreeStuff.co.uk and the Free Stuff Facebook Group: there is an amazing community of freebie hunters that share offers all the times and also offer advice on what to stay away from (as there are some scammers out there too).\n\n\u2018Keep an eye on your emails as product testing invites need to be answered quickly.\n\n\u2018Companies have a limited number of samples, so the quicker you can apply the better.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I check the Free Stuff group few times a day. I also check emails regularly to be able to accept products testing invites on time. Apply as soon as you see the links, as the quicker you apply, the more chances you have of getting it.\u2019\n\nAre you an expert bargain hunter? Are you brilliant at saving money?
