The U.S. will not raise tariffs on Oct. 15 from 25 percent to 30 percent. It\u2019s still unclear whether Trump plans to halt another round of tariffs that are set to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d\n\nPhase two negotiations are expected to begin immediately after the first agreement is signed. (China\u2019s trade team is not calling the decision a \u201cdeal,\u201d but rather a pause in the 15-month long tit-for-tat tariff war).\n\n\u201cOther aspects of the deal are also great,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cBut WOW, the Farmers really hit pay dirt!\u201d\n\nFarmers -- an important voting base for Trump -- have been one of the biggest casualties of the trade war.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing more than $12.4 billion worth of the oil seed in 2017, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Retaliatory tariffs by China resulted in U.S. soybean exports to China falling by more than 80 percent, though sales accelerated ahead of the talks in Washington this week.\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Jonathan Garber contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "\"WOW, the Farmers really hit pay dirt!\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Saturday.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/trump-xi-video-thumbnail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
