The companies travelling with Merkel include Volkswagen, Allianz and Deutsche Bank, according to the German daily Bild, which carried a headline Friday that read: \u201cDo our companies not care about Hong Kong\u2019s freedom?\u201d\n\nPress access to her visit was unusually tight, with a number of members of the Beijing foreign press corps, including AFP, unable to get accreditation for the event.\n\nIn a statement, the German Federation of Journalists criticised the limited access as a \u201cdiplomatic farce\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat image do the organisers have of the travelling German press? Did they think that the chancellor of Germany is coming with her courtiers, who politely listen, ask no questions and report meekly?\u201d it said. Chinese officials blamed a lack of space due to a large contingent of journalists accompanying Merkel.\n\nMerkel also met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday evening, according to state news agency Xinhua, and the two leaders were scheduled to have dinner together.\n\nXi said that with unilateralism and protectionism posing a serious threat to world stability it is \u201cincreasingly important\u201d for China and Germany to strengthen cooperation, on the basis of mutual respect, Xinhua reported.\n\nThe German leader is also due to give a speech to university students in the central city of Wuhan on Saturday.\n\nAhead of her trip, prominent Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong and others had recalled, in an open letter published by Bild on Wednesday, that Merkel grew up in the communist police state of East Germany.\n\n\u201cYou have firsthand experience of the terrors of a dictatorial government,\u201d the letter read.\n\nHong Kong's leader withdraws extradition bill that ignited mass protests Read more\n\n\u201cWe hope that you will express your concern about our catastrophic situation, and that you will convey our demands to the Chinese government during your stay in China.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has endured dozens of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests triggered by opposition to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.\n\nIn their open letter the protesters also warned that \u201cGermany should be on its guard before doing business with China, as China does not comply with international law and has repeatedly broken its promises\u201d.\n\nA number of Chinese dissidents have been given refuge in Germany, including the artist Ai Weiwei.\n\nIn May two former Hong Kong independence activists were granted refugee status in Germany in what is one of the first cases of dissenters from the semi-autonomous Chinese city receiving such protection.\n\nOn a visit to China in 2018, Merkel met with the wife of a Chinese human rights lawyer charged with state subversion, an extremely rare meeting between a dissident and a visiting head of state.\n\nThe trip marks her 12th visit to China as chancellor.\n\nXinhua said China accounted for the largest share of imports into Germany in 2018 with goods worth \u20ac106.2 bn ($117.4 bn).", "description": "\u2018In the current situation, everything must be done to avoid violence,\u2019 German chancellor says in Beijing", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a54b98c5619b60c26d669250589f9476e0e5021f/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce444bad40e04f865feee34486f2c31c", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
