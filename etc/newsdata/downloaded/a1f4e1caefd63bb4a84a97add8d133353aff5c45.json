A different approach, for what was an unprecedented set of events.\n\nAt around 10.12pm Bulgarian time, after England debutant Tyrone Mings had reported racist chanting to his captain Harry Kane, Uefa\u2019s new three-step protocol for dealing with racist abuse was enacted for the first time. This ensured it was a landmark night, with some encouragement, if also a highly depressing one.\n\nFor the first time in history it gave agency to the players in such a situation, and a choice. They decided to forego the option to walk off the pitch and have the game abandoned, and decided to play on.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor football journalists, though, it was no longer about writing a match report. The football action became largely irrelevant, a sense that was only deepened by the feeling of unreality around the game.\n\nIt was about capturing the details of the entire night. There were long passages when we were barely watching the football, but instead looking around at where the abuse was, how authorities were reacting, what the key officials were doing.\n\nIt was also one of those nights when the ability to put WhatsApp on your desktop is never handier, because of the necessity to send messages and put questions to all of the various bodies and figures involved \u2013 especially when there was so much confusion about it all.\n\nNobody thought the game would actually be completed. England manager Gareth Southgate admitted he and his staff felt the same, in post-match press conferences that followed the same theme. No one was really asking about the football \u2013 or themes like the improved performance of Marcus Rashford \u2013 beyond praising the England players for performing so well in the circumstances.\n\nSouthgate and FA chairman Greg Clarke were instead talking about what can be done, and problems that go way deeper than football.\n\nThis led to a bizarre scene where one Bulgarian journalist interrupted both men and started to shout about \u201cexaggeration\u201d. Some journalists assertively but calmly pointed out why he was wrong afterwards.\n\nIt was anything but exaggeration. It was a landmark night that went way beyond football.\n\nYours,\n\nMiguel Delaney\n\nChief football writer", "description": "Monday in Sofia was one of those grim nights when a football journalist stops reporting on the sport and is instead writing about a live story, with far deeper societal dimensions.
