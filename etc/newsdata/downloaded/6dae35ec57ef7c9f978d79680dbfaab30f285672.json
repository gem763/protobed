There will also be a gallery area on the upper floor (pictured, an architect's drawing for the new place of worship)\n\nThe planning application was submitted to East Suffolk Council on last week and is yet to be approved or declined (pictured, an architect's drawing of the new building)\n\nThe building - reduced in size after a failed bid to build a chapel last year - would be set north of Sheeran's home in Framlingham, Suffolk. Also pictured, the main house and a swimming pool at the house. Sheeran has also built a football pitch at his estate\n\nResidents have also raised concerns that the new building does not fit in with the prevailing landscape and is not in keeping with the village.\n\nOne resident said: 'It's his home from home retreat and yes it's his home but sometimes things are taken too far.\n\n'There a dividing line in the area with Sheeran, some people aren't too fussed while others are getting concerned about what is happening at the site.\n\n'The council should refuse these plans, they have changed from last time but the concept is very similar and is not in keeping with the local environment.\n\n'The village has a church already and like the plans for the wedding plans it creates an impression that the village has a second place of worship.\n\n'It's plan after plan with him, you don't know what he's going to do next.'\n\nResidents previously raised similar concerns about plans for his wedding chapel which was given the boot by council chiefs last September.\n\nThey claimed that the development he had shown a 'total disregard to the local ecology' and was taking his building work too far.\n\nSheeran tried to build a wedding chapel for when he and now wife Cherry married last year (pictured left and right together at an Ipswich Town football match). That application was rejected by council officials, on grounds the proposed 48ft-high Saxon style tower would create 'unsatisfactory visual impacts'\n\nResident Tony Robinson, who previously objected to the chapel plans:: 'I don't know why he wanted his own private chapel.\n\n'There are lots of churches for sale round her and he could buy one of those if he wanted.\n\n'I think he is just being self indulgent.'\n\nSheeran hopes that the new building will provide a 'private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer'.\n\nThe place of worship would be build towards his home's eastern boundary because 'the rising of the sun is relevant both in the Abrahamic and oriental traditions', according to planning statements.\n\nDocuments submitted to the council reveal the building will not compete with the nearby village church.\n\nIt will have a 'sweeping boat-shaped feel' and a leaf-shaped roof and a 'cone' rather than a spire, to ensure it doesn't overshadow the nearby Church of St Mary.\n\nIts lead roof and flint walls will be paired with small quantities of limestone, oak floors and the building will have stained glass windows.\n\nThe planning application was submitted to East Suffolk Council and is yet to be approved or declined.\n\nThe new proposal is yet to be approved or rejected by the council, but it is understood a decision will be made next month (pictured, an architect's drawing of the new place of worship)\n\nThe design statement submitted by Donald Insall Associates, an architectural practice, said the building would 'address an important need for a private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer'\n\nThe place of worship would be build towards his home's eastern boundary because 'the rising of the sun is relevant both in the Abrahamic and oriental traditions', according to planning statements (pictured on site plan, boxed in red towards the top-right)\n\nAfter amassing an estimated \u00a3160million fortune, the superstar singer has set about creating his own extraordinary estate \u2013 dubbed 'Sheeranville' \u2013 including five properties bought for a total of \u00a33.7 million (pictured, his estate in August)\n\nThe design statement submitted by Donald Insall Associates, an architectural practice, said: 'It would address an important need for a private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for celebration of key life and family milestones, family and social gatherings, marriages, christenings, and so forth.\n\n'It would also allow the applicant's family, friends and colleagues to be able enjoy these things and join them in their observance.\n\n'The proposed building would be a space truly ancillary to the main house, but apart from it in order to provide calm and separation.\n\n'The applicant has [...] guests and visiting colleagues at [his home], people from around the world.\n\n'Many of these people are from many countries, faiths and customs, including for example the USA, Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Asia and Australia.\n\n'Thus, the applicant seeks to provide a space in which, he, his family and these different people can retreat for contemplation, prayer and relaxation, to meet celebrate and meditate in peace and safety from disturbance, when they visit.'\n\nPublicly available documents give a fascinating insight into the scale of the works, including building an underground music room, cinema and tunnel to link Wynneys Hall, the main house, to a barn that has been converted into the Lancaster Lock pub \u2013 named after his wife (pictured, the estate in August)\n\nWork had only just started in March, 2018 (pictured). East Suffolk Council's planning department has now waded through a swathe of applications since the 28-year-old first moved back to his home town of Framlingham in 2012\n\nSheeran also has a nearby wildlife pond, which drew complaints from locals who alleged it was being used as a swimming pool as it had steps, handrail and a jetty\n\nIt added the building was 'novel and modern' so won't conflict with the nearby church.\n\n'It is carefully modelled with curved walls on plan and in elevation, which give it a sweeping boat shaped feel,' the statement added.\n\n'Its plan similarly expresses this, yet it can be 'read' in many different ways: the building design is clearly organic and natural, the roof is leaf shaped, the form could represent a pair of cupped hands, or a chalice, or the plan a mother and child or fish or beetle.\n\n'Its design is reflective of shapes and forms that are familiar to all, allowing each person to interpret its symbolism freely in their own way, which reflects the principle of it being multi use and non-denominational.\n\n'It does not seek to follow or ape a previous building typology, but is an evolved form of the Suffolk vernacular, having echoes of round towers, mills, wind pumps and so forth.'\n\nSheeran tried to build a wedding chapel for when he and now wife Cherry married last year.\n\nThat application was rejected by council officials, on grounds the proposed 48ft-high Saxon style tower would create 'unsatisfactory visual impacts'.\n\nThe new proposal is yet to be approved or rejected by the council, but it is understood a decision will be made next month.\n\nSheeran moved to the Suffolk site in 2012, and has submitted numerous applications to transform the plot.\n\nThe global megastar added a man cave to the the original farmhouse, containing a billiard room, recording studio, jacuzzi, and gym.\n\nHe snatched up a Grade II-listed farmhouse the same year, and a four-bed house and a bungalow in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\nSheeran also has a pub with a cinema, a treehouse, a garage which looks like a barn, and an outdoor kitchen where he can BBQ.\n\nHe also has a nearby wildlife pond, which drew complaints from locals who alleged it was being used as a swimming pool as it had steps, handrail and a jetty.\n\nThe singer was allowed to keep the pond, though the council ordered him to remove a nearby wooden caravan which had been converted into a sauna.", "description": "Last week, Ed Sheeran's brother-in-law submitted plans to East Suffolk Council for the new prayer retreat, which will be used for social gatherings, marriages and christenings.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain", "James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19487906-0-image-a-2_1570620042155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
