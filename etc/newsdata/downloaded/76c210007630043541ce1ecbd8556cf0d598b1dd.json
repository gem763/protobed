It\u2019s not something you can control. This is the situation,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe excited about the prospect of having great preparation for the quarter-final now.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought we would have two relatively easy games, one tough game and then two weeks to prepare for a quarter-final. So someone is smiling on us \u2013 the typhoon gods maybe?\u201d\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin stated that the governing body\u2019s hand was forced by the danger posed by the region\u2019s biggest storm of 2019, which is on course to hit the mainland in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nDefeat was conceded in attempts to move the cancelled games to Oita due to the logistics demands.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine the decision has not been taken lightly and is in the best interest of safety as a priority,\u201d Gilpin said.\n\nAlan Gilpin faced the media on Thursday (Eugene Hoskiko/AP)\n\n\u201cWe looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. Important to note is that we are in accordance with what we said we\u2019d do before the tournament.\n\n\u201cMoving teams round on this scale and being able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams\u2026.we couldn\u2019t guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can\u2019t do it for all, we can\u2019t do it for any.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s decision has received a mixed reception, with Italy captain Sergio Parisse describing it as \u201cridiculous\u201d and adding that the Azzurri \u201cdeserve to be respected as a team\u201d.\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen admits it is unsatisfactory but backed World Rugby, stating \u201cthe right decisions are being made because it\u2019s all about safety.\u201d\n\nNo one expected Italy to topple world champions New Zealand and replace them in the quarter-finals, but Scotland have every chance to defeating Japan and potentially denying the hosts a first ever quarter-final place.\n\nThe Scottish Rugby Union has demanded a contingency plan be drawn up for the match and head coach Gregor Townsend has urged that everything possible is done to to ensure it goes ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have to have faith in the organisers that the game will be played even if it\u2019s behind closed doors or at a different venue,\u201d Townsend said.", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis is ripping through Japan.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/wire-19539610-1570712322-158_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
