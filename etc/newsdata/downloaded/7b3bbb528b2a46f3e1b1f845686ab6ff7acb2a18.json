They are seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nBut Human Rights Watch says the trial does not meet international standards and that Saudi authorities have \"obstructed meaningful accountability\".\n\nOil flotation\n\nOn Tuesday, the first day of the three-day event, participants include three people who pulled out at the last minute last year:\n\nStephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group\n\nTidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse\n\nLarry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock.\n\nOther big names due to speak on Tuesday were Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, World Bank President David Malpass and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nNot all business sectors have returned to the Saudi fold. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi was one of last year's dropouts and big tech firms are absent from this year's line-up.\n\nThe forum is taking place as uncertainty continues over the timing of plans to float part of Saudi state oil giant Aramco.\n\nThe latest reports carried by al-Arabiya television suggest that shares in Aramco will begin trading on the Riyadh stock exchange on 11 December, but there has been no official confirmation.", "description": "The Saudi event includes some figures who stayed away in 2018 over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C48/production/_109444130_desertdavos_rtr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
