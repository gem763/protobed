Not so on Tuesday night, coach Mike Thibault said, after they clung on to win 97-95 in Game 1 in the league semifinals against the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nThough he was already visualizing the list of what the Mystics should work on in practice before Thursday\u2019s Game 2, the narrow win didn\u2019t cause Thibault to have a sleepless night.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d walked out of there saying \u2018OK, I feel miserable even though we won,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t think we could get better, then it would be an issue,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nWhile Washington worked, the Aces took a different tack, electing to cancel Wednesday\u2019s practice. There could be a few reasons for that decision \u2014 they played Sunday in Las Vegas before flying east, so physical recovery could have something to do with it.\n\nThe Mystics hadn\u2019t faced much adversity in the final weeks of the season, when they won their final six games by an average margin of almost 17 points. But facing a 57-50 halftime deficit after being outplayed in the second quarter, players said no one lost their cool in the locker room.\n\n\u201cOur maturity is better than last year,\u201d LaToya Sanders said. \u201cNot, like I said, panicking when a team goes on a run, which was something that we did last year. Being able to come back from deficits and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics pinpointed their play in transition as an area of concern. Las Vegas scored seven fast-break points on 3-for-3 shooting just in the first half. Washington didn\u2019t have a single fast break in the same span.\n\n\u201cIt was literally, the only thing we said at halftime was to stop transition. Stop transition buckets,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMaybe we would be cross-matched, maybe a guard would be on a big or a big on a guard. But to just match up, and then we\u2019ll figure it out on the fly.\u201d\n\nBut transition defense was \u201cnot necessarily\u201d the primary focus of Tuesday\u2019s practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we talked about in film. But from the standpoint of today\u2019s practice, it\u2019s just how to make us better,\u201d Natasha Cloud said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s our offense, whether it\u2019s figuring out how to guard certain plays that we maybe struggled with last night.\n\n\u201cTransition defense is about getting back and protecting. That falls a lot on the guards, but also our bigs getting back and not playing so much on the rebounds when (the opponent) secured it, because they\u2019re pushing it at us.\u201d\n\nThibault also felt they improved on transition defense after halftime and hoped it would carry over into Game 2.\n\n\u201cI think because we\u2019ve been through this before \u2014 if this were our first time going through this maybe we wouldn\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they know the sense of urgency. They know the importance of trying to correct 4 or 5 things \u2026 that we can do better.\u201d\n\nWhile the Mystics have \u201cbeen through this before,\u201d the Aces have not. They are competing in their first postseason since 2014, when the franchise was known as the San Antonio Stars and rostered none of the top players and No. 1 overall draft picks they do today.\n\nStill, Aces coach Bill Laimbeer is no first-timer. He coached the Detroit Shock to three WNBA titles in the 2000s decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have our moments that we fall down, but overall if we can do a little bit better effort consistently throughout the game, we\u2019ll have a good chance to win again,\u201d Laimbeer said after the game.\n\nGame 2 tips off at 8:30 Thursday on ESPN2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
