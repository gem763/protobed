I could never pinpoint the exact reason why I hated seeing dramatic conversations go down in front of a row of lockers...but I did know I'd be totally fine with never seeing an episode of Riverdale. Had I just grown out of teen dramas? Perhaps I was tired of watching actors in their twenties pretend to navigate adolescence. Maybe I was just sick of watching the new kid try to decide where to sit at lunch.\n\nObviously, I know some of the best shows of all time take place in a high school. We all grew up on One Tree Hill and Friday Night Lights, there would be no Drake without Degrassi, and I've never had a mood that a Gossip Girl rewatch couldn't fix. Still, I dipped out of Netflix's \"Recently Added\" section every time I saw a new show being promoted with a kid in a school uniform. Even the perfectly twisty, creepy trailer for The Society had me rolling my eyes at the prospect of getting to know another cast of teens. I wanted shows about grown ups! Right?\n\nMaybe not. After some soul-searching, I realized that high schoolers are exactly what we need for great TV. For starters, homework and babysitting gigs are easy to blow off, so these kids can waste their days doing ridiculous stuff with their friends, and we never bat an eye. Adults don't get to spend every waking moment with their besties IRL, and when they do it on television, it's kind of distracting. I mean, think of the characters in Friends. They spend all of their time lounging on a couch in a coffee shop, but can somehow still afford sick apartments in Manhattan. It makes no sense.\n\nAnother great thing about teens on TV is that they're practically engineered to be wildly dramatic. They're supposed to do stupid things and be repeatedly shocked by the results of their poor decisions. It's pretty acceptable for them to act on impulse, date the wrong person, or experiment with drugs and alcohol. It's just part of growing up. But when a grown-ass character character can't make a single decent choice, it gets old fast. If you've never wanted to slap Carrie Bradshaw for buying another pair of Manolos while simultaneously complaining about her finances, you weren't paying enough attention during Sex and the City.\n\nThe greatest thing about teen dramas is that they deal with all of the issues everyone needs to talk about, whether you're currently enrolled in driver's ed or old enough to need an eye cream. Euphoria and The Society brilliantly handle topics like mental health, addiction, sexuality and social media without turning into after-school specials. They entertain and make you think. I genuinely think I learned more from one season of Netflix's Sex Education than I have from Googling all of the sexual health questions that were never addressed in health class.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Giphy More\n\nTBH, teen shows are just so cool right now. I don't think this point needs much explaining, seeing as we're all out here gluing rhinestones on our eyelids to channel Maddy Perez's fierce energy. As for the whole \"being bothered by older actors playing unrealistic high schoolers\" thing...I have changed my mind, and will not be accepting questions at this time. All I have to say is that it's actually quite nice to know that Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi) is 22 in real life. Bless.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The jury's still out on letterman jackets, though.", "authors": ["Hannah Chambers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yxv8BQl6pbWHkX_wxkBuGA--~B/aD01Mzk7dz0xMDczO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/01326acee011721aca8377c53c085504"}
