I could never pinpoint the exact reason I hated seeing dramatic conversations go down in front of a row of lockers...but I did know I\u2019d be totally fine with never seeing an episode of Riverdale. Had I just grown out of teen dramas? Perhaps I was tired of watching actors in their 20s pretend to navigate adolescence. Maybe I was just sick of watching the new kid try to decide where to sit at lunch.\n\nObviously, I know some of the best shows of all time take place in a high school. We all grew up on One Tree Hill and Friday Night Lights, there would be no Drake without Degrassi, and I\u2019ve never had a mood that a Gossip Girl rewatch couldn\u2019t fix. Still, I dipped out of Netflix\u2019s Recently Added section every time I saw a new show being promoted with a kid in a school uniform. Even the perfectly twisty, creepy trailer for The Society had me rolling my eyes at the prospect of getting to know another cast of teens. I wanted shows about grown-ups! Right?\n\nMaybe not. After some soul searching, I realized that high schoolers are exactly what we need for great TV. For starters, homework and babysitting gigs are easy to blow off, so these kids can waste their days doing ridiculous stuff with their friends and we never bat an eye. Adults don\u2019t get to spend every waking moment with their besties IRL, and when they do it on television, it\u2019s kind of distracting. I mean, think of the characters in Friends. They spend all their time lounging on a couch in a coffee shop but can somehow still afford sick apartments in Manhattan. It makes no sense.\n\nAnother great thing about teens on TV is that they\u2019re practically engineered to be wildly dramatic. They\u2019re supposed to do stupid things and be repeatedly shocked by the results of their poor decisions. It\u2019s pretty acceptable for them to act on impulse, date the wrong person, or experiment with drugs and alcohol. It\u2019s just part of growing up. But when a grown-ass character can\u2019t make a single decent choice, it gets old fast. If you\u2019ve never wanted to slap Carrie Bradshaw for buying another pair of Manolos while simultaneously complaining about her finances, you weren\u2019t paying enough attention during Sex and the City.\n\nThe greatest thing about teen dramas is that they deal with all the issues everyone needs to talk about, whether you\u2019re currently enrolled in driver\u2019s ed or old enough to need an eye cream. Euphoria and The Society brilliantly handle topics like mental health, addiction, sexuality, and social media without turning into after-school specials. They entertain and make you think. I genuinely think I learned more from one season of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education than I have from googling all the sexual health questions that were never addressed in health class.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Giphy More\n\nTBH, teen shows are just so cool right now. I don\u2019t think this point needs much explaining, seeing as we\u2019re all out here gluing rhinestones on our eyelids to channel Maddy Perez\u2019s fierce energy. As for the whole \u201cbeing bothered by older actors playing unrealistic high schoolers\u201d thing...I have changed my mind and will not be accepting questions at this time. All I have to say is that it\u2019s actually quite nice to know that Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi) is 22 in real life.
