I was among the first to drive one \u2014 Jaguar\u2019s Tesla challenger, the I-Pace.\n\nI took it out on a slippery track a short distance from the show hall \u2014 and it\u2019s great fun. It\u2019s stylish, but would fit well in any family driveway.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I was surprised, but it drives like a Jaguar, too, though running entirely on electric power, it lacks the traditional roar. But it still feels taut and fast.\n\nFuture classic: The I-Pace drives like a Jaguar though running entirely on electric power, it lacks the traditional roar\n\nAnd it accelerates like lightning, hitting 60 mph from rest in just 4.5 seconds.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t just going in straight lines.\n\nI was throwing it around in the rain with abandon on an automotive assault course of tight turns and even a stint on a skid pan, as well as doing a fair few manoeuvres of my own.\n\nIt\u2019s sure-footed and fun with a top speed of 124 mph. Yet it still promises a range of 298 miles \u2014 or just enough battery charge to drive from London to Newcastle \u2014 on one overnight charge.\n\nRay tried out the I-Pace on a slippery track a short distance from the show hall at the Geneva Motor Show\n\nQuick: The I-Pace hits 60 mph from rest in just 4.5 seconds and has a top speed of 124 mph\n\nPriced from \u00a358,995 to \u00a376,995, which includes a taxpayer subsidy of \u00a34,500, it\u2019s available to order now in four trim levels: S, SE, HSE and a top of the range First Edition launch model.\n\nDeliveries are set for July, when the first models also reach showrooms. But customers can order and \u2018configure\u2019 their cars online now at jaguar.co.uk\n\nTwo Jaguar-designed electric motors \u2014 one at each axle \u2014 develop a total of 400 bhp \u2014 that\u2019s about four Ford Fiestas.\n\nComing soon: The electric Jag is priced from \u00a358,995 to \u00a376,995, which includes a taxpayer subsidy of \u00a34,500, with deliveries set for July\n\nCredentials: Jaguar says owners will be able to achieve an 80 per cent charge in 85 minutes\n\nProviding the power is a high-tech 90kWh lithium-ion battery that sits centrally and low between the axles, to give perfect 50:50 weight distribution.\n\nJaguar says owners will be able to achieve an 80 per cent charge in 85 minutes using a 50kW DC charger.\n\nA 30-minute charge will give a range of about 80 miles.\n\nA fast charge will power the battery to 80 per cent capacity in just 45 minutes.\n\nHome charging overnight achieves 80 per cent power in just over ten hours, while a full charge will take 12.9 hours.\n\nJaguar has pipped Audi, and a host of other rivals, to the post.\n\nNimble: Jaguar has pipped Audi, and a host of other rivals, to the post\n\nVOLVO XC40 IS CAR OF THE YEAR Volvo boss Hakan Samuelsson with the European Car of the Year award for the XC40 SUV Volvo\u2019s new XC40 SUV, which I road tested recently, is a deserving winner of this year\u2019s prestigious European Car of the Year award, which was announced on the eve of the Geneva Motor show and collected by the Swedish car firm\u2019s chief executive Hakan Samuelsson. In a Eurovision-style tallying of points for the industry\u2019s Oscars it beat six other shortlisted cars: Alfa Romeo\u2019s Stelvio, the Audi A8, BMW 5-series, Citroen C3 Aircross, Kia Stinger, and Seat Ibiza.\n\nToyota unveils new British-built Auris\n\nToyota took the wraps of its new Auris hybrid hatchback (above) which, along with petrol versions, will be built at the Japanese giant\u2019s plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, ready for sale in the first quarter of next year.\n\nBrexit boost: The new Auris hybrid hatchback, along with petrol versions, will be built at the Japanese giant\u2019s plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire\n\nBut it also delivered a shock by announcing the death knell for diesel.\n\nToyota will end sales of all diesel cars in Britain and Europe by the end of this decade and plans to boost petrol-electric hybrids in their place.\n\nLast year 45 per cent of Toyota UK sales were hybrid and fewer than 7 per cent were diesel, plummeting to 4.5 per cent in January.\n\nTwo-door Range Rover is three times the price\n\nThe new two-door 165 mph Range Rover SV Coupe from Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s special vehicle operations division in Ryton, Coventry, has half the number of doors and costs three times the price of a standard Range Rover \u2014 a hefty \u00a3240,000.\n\nMost expensive Range Rover yet: Just 999 of these limited edition Range Rover SV Coupes will be built, each once costing at least \u00a3240,000\n\nProduction is limited to 999 vehicles, all hand-built.
