He was actually my boss.\n\n\"I was 16 when we met but there was nothing bad going on before I was an adult.\n\n\"Spending time together opening a store gives you a lot of time to get to know someone.\n\n\"You are the only two there so you have to talk to each other or it's silent.\n\n(Image: @northernvoyages/ Jam Press)\n\n(Image: @northernvoyages/ Jam Press)\n\n\u201cThat made us end up connecting outside of work and eventually it turned into a relationship. We have been together for two years and nine months.\u201d\n\nKayana said that Mike had been an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.\n\nShe said: \"He's shown me how I should be treated when I was so used to being treated the wrong way, and always makes sure I know how loved I am and how lucky he is to have me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mike said Kayana had given him hope in love again and a \"reason to care about things\".\n\nKayana's parents are still not supportive of her relationship with Mike, but the 22-year-old has learned to accept that not everyone will embrace them with open arms.\n\n(Image: @northernvoyages/ Jam Press)\n\n(Image: @northernvoyages/ Jam Press)\n\nShe said: \"In so many ways. I was totally insecure before our relationship and he has helped me improve so much.\n\n\"Still not perfect, but getting there. It also helped me realise how judgemental people are and who to stay away from.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is supportive.\n\n\"I'm the younger one and obviously my parents at first thought he's just using me, trying to get something out of me.\n\n\u201cIt's gotten better, but they will never support it.\u201d\n\nFor Kayana, their age gap is a positive rather than a negative - allowing them to understand their respective generations' perspetives.\n\nShe said: \"It's just a connection that happened and I didn't let age stop it.\n\n(Image: @northernvoyages/ Jam Press)\n\n\"We both have things in common. We don't like partying, we would rather be at home with each other.\n\n\u201cWe wish people understood that it's all about the connection and not about money, etc. \"That's a big misconception in these relationships. No fears.\u201d\n\nNow Kayana and Mike are looking for a house together and have plans to get married soon.\n\nOffering a final word of advice to age-gap couples, Kayana said: \"Do what makes you happy and don't let others get to you.\"", "description": "Kayana Vasquez and Mike Krupka, from Minnesota in the US, were transferred to different branches only meeting again years later", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Northernvoyages", "Jam Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-A-22-year-old-woman-is-now-dating-her-53-year-old-boss-and-she-was-just-16-the-first-time-they-met.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
