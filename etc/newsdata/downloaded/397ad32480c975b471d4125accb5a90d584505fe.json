But to get the most value out of your phone, you should trade it in sooner rather than later. Once Google\u2019s next phone is in the wild, the value of your older Google Pixel 1, 2, or 3 will greatly diminish.\n\nNow that the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL have been announced, many will decide whether they\u2019ll go for the latest model or buy a lightly used phone from an older generation that will suit their needs without breaking the bank. If you\u2019ve got an older Pixel model and are ready for an upgrade, here are a few steps to take in order to get your device ready to sell, followed by how much cash you can expect to earn back.\n\nInspect your phone\n\nIf your old Pixel device is in good condition, you shouldn\u2019t have much of a problem finding a new owner. As mentioned in our guide on selling your iPhone, having a phone in good condition is crucial to finding a buyer who\u2019s willing to pay top dollar.\n\nEven if your phone isn\u2019t in the best shape, you should still be able to get something for your trade. Take into consideration its blemishes, including scratches, dents, cracks, and any other quirks that the next owner should know about. Be honest or else it will probably come back to bite you.\n\nErase your phone\n\nThere are three steps involved in securely wiping your Android phone. These steps can vary slightly depending on whether you have a Pixel, Samsung, or a phone from another manufacturer. The instructions here are for a Pixel; if you have a different phone, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to figure out the similar steps\n\nDisable Factory Reset Protection. This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it\u2019s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You\u2019ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cSecurity\u201d > \u201cScreen lock\u201d and select \u201cNone.\u201d Remove your account. Assuming you have updated to Android 10, erasing your phone starts with navigating to Settings > \u201cAccounts\u201d and tapping on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that\u2019s listed there. Then tap on \u201cRemove account.\u201d You\u2019ll get a warning pop-up. Tap on \u201cRemove account\u201d again. Factory reset the phone. The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select \u201cSystem\u201d and then hit \u201cAdvanced\u201d at the bottom. If you haven\u2019t backed up your phone to Google Drive recently, you can go to \u201cBackup\u201d and select \u201cBack up now.\u201d Otherwise, going into \u201cReset options\u201d will take you to the final step. Select \u201cErase all data (factory reset).\u201d You will get a warning page, and if you\u2019ve neglected to sign out of any accounts, it will be listed there (and you should go back and remove it). Otherwise, tap on \u201cErase all data.\u201d\n\nTrade or sell?\n\nWhen you trade in your phone to a manufacturer or carrier, you may be trading price for convenience. It\u2019s up to you which you choose.\n\nGoogle\u2019s trade-in program can be accessed during the checkout process for a new phone. During its preorder period, Google says it offers up to $400 for a trade-in. I pretended to have a Pixel 3 with 64GB storage that was in working condition and free of cracks, and I was offered $225, while a Pixel 3 XL with 64GB brought a quote of $260. A Pixel 2 with 64GB storage got me an offer of $110, and a 2 XL was worth $143. Finally, an original unlocked Pixel with 32GB was worth a big $47, while its XL sibling brought $66.\n\nYou may be able to get a better deal with a carrier as long as you read the small print. For example, Verizon is offering a discount of $450 on a new phone if you trade in one of a long list of phones (and commit yourself to its Unlimited plan), while T-Mobile will give you a free Pixel 4 if you switch to its plan and have a Pixel 3, 3 XL, 2, or 2 XL.\n\nAs for where you can sell your old Pixel phone, Swappa.com is a top pick with a healthy community of buyers and sellers. Since what you can get from a site like Swappa can vary, I looked at both the average sales prices for the various Pixels and the lowest price suggested (for which you would more likely find a buyer).\n\nAn original Pixel with 32GB of storage brought an average price of $90 and a low price of $71, while a Pixel XL got an average of $115 and a low price of $85. An unlocked Pixel 2 with 64GB rated an average of $227 and a low price of $170; the 2 XL version was quoted with an average of $216 and a low price of $190. Finally, an unlocked Pixel 3 with 64GB had an average selling price of $319 and a low price of $285; the 3 XL version brought an average of $351 and a low selling price of $329.\n\nThere are, of course, other sites where you can sell your phones, including eBay and Gazelle. Whether you use one of them to make up the cost of a new Google Pixel 4 or decide that the convenience of trading the phone in is worth the extra bucks is up to you.", "description": "The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL won\u2019t be cheap, but trading in your old Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone will make Google\u2019s next flagship phone a bit more affordable.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c9qOwItyqsM5RzSLrZUI1wpDkfs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9493625/pixel_pixel2_vladsavov.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-08"}
