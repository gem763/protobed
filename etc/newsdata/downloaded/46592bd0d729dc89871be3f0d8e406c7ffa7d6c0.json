Mr. Sayyed said the document was his office\u2019s \u201chighest priority.\u201d\n\nThe dominance of big tech companies has increasingly become a bipartisan issue in Washington, D.C., and around the country. A group of 48 states\u2019 attorneys general, as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, on Monday announced a probe of Google\u2019s practices in online advertising markets.\n\nThe scrutiny has been fueled in part by the view that the current approach to enforcing U.S. antitrust laws has led to the accumulation of overly large market shares and political clout by tech companies in a way that harms consumers.\n\nResponding to the announcement of an investigation by the states\u2019 attorneys general, a Google spokesman on Monday referred to a blog post by executive Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs. \u201cGoogle\u2019s services help people, create more choice, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the United States,\u201d Mr. Walker wrote.\n\nThe FTC in February created a task force to examine antitrust violations in the tech industry. The Justice Department in July said it was also reviewing whether tech companies were unlawfully stifling competition.\n\nThe pressure to tackle the competition issues posed by big tech companies has led to skirmishes between the two agencies, which share the responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws.\n\nMr. Sayyed, in his speech this week, voiced some support for existing antitrust laws. Calls to regulate the operational decisions of digital platforms do not take into account the \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cvitality\u201d of federal antitrust law\u2019s ability to integrate new economic concepts, he said.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission plans to lay out exactly how U.S. antitrust laws apply to big technology companies\u2014an effort intended to guide its own enforcement and highlight potential regulatory gaps.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106722/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
