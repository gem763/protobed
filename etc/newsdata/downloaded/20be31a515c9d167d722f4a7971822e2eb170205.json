The athleticism of what he does, as a combat athlete, is there, and then some. Plus, is there a better showman on the planet than Tyson Fury? He was custom made to do this.\n\n\"So, he's been on the radar for us a long time as a performer. We had the right time come up, we reached out to him, he had some time, some down-time, and was looking forward to doing it. He was a big fan, and it just worked out perfectly. Some things happen for a reason.\"\n\n(Image: WWE)\n\nFury is due to take on Deontay Wilder for a second time in February and had been expected to rest after suffering a huge cut above his eye during his win over Otto Wallin last month.\n\nBut the Brit said: \"I think I was born to do this. I'm a natural entertainer as you can see with the boxing. Now I'm going to the real entertainment, the best value in entertainment in sports, WWE.\n\n\"How do I plan on beating Braun Strowman? Well, you're going to have to watch on October 31. I can't reveal my strategy. Listen, I'm learning my wrestling. You're going to be shocked.\"", "description": "Fury takes on Braun Strowman at WWE Crown Jewell on October 31 in Saudi Arabia", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Wwe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586544.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WWE-Announces-Matches-With-Tyson-Fury-And-Cain-Velasquez-At-Crown-Jewel-Event.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
