Long-lasting, energy efficient and inexpensive, LED technology has gobbled up half of the general lighting market in a decade. And industry experts predict its share will continue to rise, topping 60 per cent by the end of next year. However, LED lights emit much higher quantities of blue light than standard incandescent bulbs of comparable brightness. Blue light, which has one of the shortest wavelengths, is also emitted by flat screens, smartphones and tablets. It has long been suspected to be the reason that night shift workers, exposed to artificial light for longer, have a greater risk of cancer. The light cuts the body's production of melatonin, which plays a key role in regulating the body clock. This may disrupt other hormones. Both prostate and breast cancer are known to be hormone-related. Blue light can penetrate the deeper layer of skin, making skin thinner and more fragile, dermatologists also claim.\n\nThe authors said that natural light is crucial for healthy humans and animals as it stimulates the body clock which in turn regulates brain activity, hormone production and cell regeneration.\n\nHowever research assistant Eileen Chow, co-first author, points out that shunning artificial light would benefit human health.\n\nShe said: 'Human lifespan has increased dramatically over the past century as we've found ways to treat diseases, and at the same time we have been spending more and more time with artificial light.\n\n'As science looks for ways to help people be healthier as they live longer, designing a healthier spectrum of light might be a possibility, not just in terms of sleeping better but in terms of overall health.'\n\nThe researchers admitted that giving up phones and laptops is not an option for many people, but suggested wearing glasses with amber lenses to filter out the blue light and protect your retinas.\n\nAnd devices which can be set to block blue emissions was also recommended.\n\nLong-lasting, energy efficient and inexpensive, LED technology has gobbled up half of the general lighting market in a decade.\n\nAnd industry experts predict its share will continue to rise, topping 60 per cent by the end of next year.\n\nHowever, LED lights emit much higher quantities of blue light than standard incandescent bulbs of comparable brightness.\n\nBlue light, which has one of the shortest wavelengths, is also emitted by flat screens, smartphones, tablets and street lights with LED bulbs, which are on the rise in Britain.\n\nIt has long been suspected to be the reason that night shift workers, exposed to artificial light for longer, have a greater risk of cancer.\n\nThe light cuts the body's production of melatonin, which plays a key role in regulating the body clock.\n\nThis may disrupt other hormones.
