These forums have allowed such communities to assert themselves more forcefully in the primary process, and also send the crowded Democratic field a message: If you want our votes, you\u2019re going to have to work for them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the Democratic presidential primary, candidates have appeared at forums devoted to women of color, women\u2019s reproductive health, Native Americans and LGBTQ people. On Thursday night, CNN will broadcast a town hall on LGBTQ issues, in what its primary organizer, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, says is the first such event.\n\nOver the course of a 4\u00bd-hour broadcast, nine candidates will face questions from some of CNN\u2019s highest-profile journalists, including Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, who will press the candidates on LGBTQ issues.\n\n\u201cLargely, we do have agreement among the field about the top line for what the priorities are for LGBTQ people,\u201d HRC spokesman Lucas Acosta said. \u201cBut what we want to hear, and what the town hall will afford us to have the opportunity to hear, is: \u2018What are your plans to address those things? How are you going to do that?\u2019 So we can hear, as LGBTQ people, who has the most well thought out and most able to be done plan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe forum comes the same week the Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments in three cases that will decide whether gay and transgender people are protected by federal anti-discrimination laws. The issue will probably feature in the town hall, Acosta said, along with other specific policy subjects such as adoption, health issues such as HIV and AIDS, and combating violence against the LGBTQ community, and, in particular, trans women of color.\n\nHRC held candidate forums in 2004 and 2008 but never had the exposure of a prime-time cable news broadcast, according to Acosta. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be having the biggest audience we ever had in our history,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile other events have not had the scale of HRC and CNN\u2019s LGBTQ town hall, they have helped push the 2020 Democratic candidates to bring specific policy proposals to the table for communities that are typically taken for granted, if not outright neglected, by the political establishment, the groups said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIndian country has been locked out of presidential campaigns and elections since the beginning of time,\u201d OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of Native American voting rights organization Four Directions, told The Washington Post. This year, he wanted things to be different.\n\nFour Directions was a lead organizer of an August forum devoted specifically to Native American issues. The unconventional format, which featured candidates speaking alongside tribal elders and members in Sioux City, Iowa, was intended to not only allow Native American voters to get to know the candidates but also to introduce the politicians to leaders and voters in the community.\n\nInitially, Semans told The Post that the campaigns were slow to respond, but after the event began to pick up media coverage, he started getting more confirmations, including from Marianne Williamson, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWarren notably used the forum to apologize for taking a much-criticized DNA test last year to prove she had Native American ancestry.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused,\u201d Warren told the audience. \u201cI have listened, and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations that we\u2019ve had together.\u201d\n\nSemans told The Post he had not expected such a response from Warren, and appreciated her remarks. He believed the 2020 Democratic candidates were taking Native American issues far more seriously than in any other contest he can remember, and praised candidates such as Warren and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro for releasing multipronged policy proposals.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have started a discussion that hasn\u2019t happened in hundreds of years, in which we were at the table talking about major issues that can really up the social and economic conditions on reservations,\u201d Semans said. He hoped to hold another forum in January, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAD\n\nJust as these forums present opportunities for Democratic candidates to demonstrate the scope of their commitment and win over skeptical voters, they also present new ways for politicians to stumble.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay presidential candidate, faced questions from some Democrats after he initially declined to attend an Iowa LGBTQ forum in September because of schedule conflicts, BuzzFeed reported. He later reversed the decision and attended.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen politicians skip out and people skip out, they\u2019re going to feel that,\u201d said Lyz Lenz, a columnist at the Cedar Rapids Gazette who co-moderated that forum. \u201cEspecially in a race where there are so many of them, every little voting bloc matters.\u201d\n\nAt that same event, former vice president Joe Biden stumbled when he called his female moderator Lenz \u201ca lovely person\u201d after receiving a tough question from her about voting for the Defense of Marriage Act, reinforcing critiques that the septuagenarian candidate is out of touch with today\u2019s social trends. As Lenz pointed out, Biden has evolved on the issue and now supports same-sex marriage, but a video of his tense response became the headline from the event.\n\nAD\n\nAn attention grabbing moment from Biden\u2019s time on stage when moderator \u2066@lyzl\u2069 pushed Biden on past votes and calling \u2066@VP\u2069 a \u201cdecent guy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d Biden tells the moderator to laugher.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust asking the questions people want to know,\u201d she replied pic.twitter.com/DB10NGuBCP \u2014 Molly Nagle (@MollyNagle3) September 21, 2019\n\nLenz told The Post she pressed Biden on the issue after hearing from the local LGBTQ community that they wanted his record addressed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo speak to the base of voters requires a language, it requires a cultural competency, an attention to the detail of policies,\u201d said Aimee Allison, who organized April\u2019s She the People presidential forum devoted to policy issues facing women of color. She believed that \u201cnone of these candidates are going to be able to win the primary without winning over and building\u201d support among diverse groups.\n\n\u201cIf you want to represent the American population,\u201d Allison said, \u201cyou have to get the skills or get out of the way.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Candidate forums held by diverse voting blocs are pressing the candidates to release specific policies.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xCdgUr9liXXtw1iWxg0wP_iyYY4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OR6H23W4CAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
