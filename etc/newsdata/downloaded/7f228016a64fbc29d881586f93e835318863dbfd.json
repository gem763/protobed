The bloke references his marriage to Hailey Baldwin and his faith as positive influences; while that\u2019s cold consolation for the godless masses, we\u2019re happy for him, we guess.\n\nYou can read the full post, in very tiny test, right here:", "description": "The singer copped to stock-standard millennial malaise and using \"pretty heavy drugs\".", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/01/bieber-face-1.jpg"}
