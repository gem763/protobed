The North Korean side told Japan by radio that about 60 people had been on the sunken boat and all were rescued, the spokesman said.\n\nJapan earlier had estimated that about 20 North Korean fishermen were thrown into the sea after the collision. Tokyo said no one on the Japanese side was hurt.\n\nTaku Eto, Japan\u2019s minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said an abrupt turn by the North Korean boat caused the collision. Photo: issei kato/Reuters While the incident ended apparently without loss of life, it points to rising tension over fishing rights in the Sea of Japan. The collision took place in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone, where boats from other countries generally aren\u2019t supposed to fish, and Tokyo has been stepping up patrols to enforce its rights. Monday\u2019s incident started fairly routinely with a Japanese warning to the North Korean ship to leave the waters. But an abrupt turn by the North Korean boat caused a collision, according to Japanese officials. The accident occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Monday about 215 miles northwest of Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula, and the North Korean ship sank around 9:25 a.m. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pressed his people to fill quotas for catching seafood, a source of foreign exchange for the isolated country. Dozens of North Korean vessels have washed up in Japan, sometimes with dead bodies aboard, suggesting that the push has forced fishermen to undertake missions for which their craft are ill-equipped.
