He told the House investigators that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky as well as security assistance for Ukraine was conditioned on the country's pursuit of investigations into whether Kiev interfered in the 2016 election and into unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\nTaylor also relayed that Sondland told a Ukrainian representative \"the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nLuskin told The Journal that Sondland would probably return if he were asked to do so.\n\nTrump has denied that there was a quid pro quo and blasted the impeachment inquiry as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nHowever, a rough transcript of the July call released by the White House reveals that the president did ask Zelensky to look into the former vice president.
