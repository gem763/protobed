You can see Klopp's dedication on the sideline, I'm convinced his work in training is similar.\n\n\"He's a strong personality. That's absolutely vital at a big club.\n\n\"I'm worried about him because the one thing United don't want is Liverpool to get above us.\"\n\nFerguson's fears appear to have become reality as Liverpool prepare to travel to Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nWhile Liverpool have enjoyed an impressive rise in the last three years, United have been in a steady decline.\n\nAfter finishing sixth and missing out on Champions League football last season, the Red Devils are currently 12th in the table after managing just nine points from their opening eight matches.", "description": "The former Manchester United boss predicted the German's impact in 2016", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Matthew Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544401.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
