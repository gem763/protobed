They are not there yet, and they may never be.\n\nIf the government wins a \"meaningful vote\" on Tuesday, the legislation to underpin the new deal would then go forward - and that would provide further opportunities to attempt amendments.\n\nWinning the next meaningful vote is only the beginning of a new phase of Brexit; it's not even the beginning of the end.", "description": "The latest gambit by an alliance of anti-no deal MPs could be a real problem for government whips.", "authors": ["Mark D'Arcy", "Parliamentary Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17BE0/production/_109284279_letwin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
