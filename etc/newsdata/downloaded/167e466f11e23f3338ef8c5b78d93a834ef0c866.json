I suffered a nasty accident while playing in the sea with the family during our half-term holiday and subsequently broke my leg in two places.\n\n\u2018I had an operation on Friday and a metal plate was fitted.\u2019\n\nThe star made a public appearance last week before jetting away (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nToday the star further elaborated on her injury, as she called into her Heart Breakfast show and gave Jamie Theakston the goss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot being able to believe it happened on the first day of her holiday, the \u2018gutted star\u2019 said: \u2018Yeah so basically I was trying to be a good mother Jamie and I put my book down, I put down the Uno cards\u2026 and I said to Hollie \u201cMummy can come on that with you\u201d and there\u2019s this like, you remember [Total] Wipeout, that TV thing? There\u2019s like a children\u2019s Total Wipeout thing in the middle of the sea and \u2026 mistily get round it and I thought yeah I can do that.\n\n\u2018So Hollie was doing brilliantly and going round it. I walked around it and then crawled across like an old person, like across the difficult bits.\n\n\u2018And then there were these three inflatable stepping stones in the middle of the sea and everyone else was running across it and I thought \u201coh I could do that, if kids can do it I can do it\u201d and I did it and I made it \u2013 I was showing off Jamie \u2013 I made it across to the other side and then my leg slipped \u2019cause obviously its wet, like an inflatable thing in the sea, my leg slipped and it went the other way and I felt it break and I fell in to the sea and I had to swim back to the shore one-legged.\u2019\n\nThat sounds way too painful to comprehend this early in the day.\n\nConfirming she broke it in two places, she said she didn\u2019t have a cast, but has got \u2018metal in my leg and a splint and it\u2019s all wrapped up and it\u2019s got a heartbeat in it\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The irony is is you know how much I hate health and safety and a guy that was running the thing said \u201cyou have to wear the life jacket\u201d and I was thinking well this is silly, it\u2019s a children\u2019s thing,\u2019 Amanda continued. \u2018So I was like \u201cugh alright then\u201d and I put on the life jacket I\u2019m really glad I did to be honest because I don\u2019t think I would have made it back as hastily as I did.\u2019\n\nEarlier Amanda posted a shot of herself with her right leg all bandaged up. She didn\u2019t look too pleased with her current situation, as she gave the camera a thumbs down.\n\n\u2018Heart Break fast ! \ud83d\udc94 #leg,\u2019 she wrote alongside the photo, which saw a pair of crutches leaning against the lounge she was propped up on.\n\nNot a fun way to spend a Euro break.\n\nThe star loves a seaside escape\n\nShe\u2019s not wasting time wallowing, though, as a rep confirmed the star would be back in the hot seat on her Heart radio show pronto.\n\nThey said: \u2018Despite this painful accident it\u2019s business as usual for Amanda and she will return to Heart Breakfast on Monday 28th October.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no Holden Amanda back!\n\nThe star has been a busy bee recently, taking her daughter along to a press junket with Angelina Jolie for Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSitting in front of Angelina (who plays Maleficent) and Elle Fanning (Princess Aurora), young Hollie didn\u2019t look even a smidge starstruck, as she happily asked questions of the Hollywood stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking the reins for the final question, Amanda asked Angelina in particular how important it was for her to play roles \u2018that gently give a message to younger people\u2019.\n\n\u2018When you know a large part of the audience is young, I think usually it\u2019s the adults that need to be reminded of these messages,\u2019 Angelina said.\n\nShe added: \u2018The message that family is not just blood, you know, half of my children are not my blood but they are absolutely my family and my children and I love them so much.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very important to understand there are lots of different ways to have family.\u2019\n\nTune in to Heart Breakfast weekdays from 6.30am-10am.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for further comment\n\nGot a showbiz story?
