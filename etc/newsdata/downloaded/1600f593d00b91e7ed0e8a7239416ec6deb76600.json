I don't use (drink) to numb pain.\n\n\"If I am excited or happy about something I am more likely to go too far.\"\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nRichard, who has children Arthur and Ivy with his wife Rebecca, also addressed how his drinking affected his marriage.\n\nHe said that \"if I'm going to get hammered and do things I shouldn't do and go missing\" then it is \"frightening\" for his wife.\n\nHe added: \"She would like me to do AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) all the time, and I just don't.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n\"But I have said I will spend more time with our therapist examining my relationship to drink.\n\n\"We're in a good place at the moment but once you have accepted you're an addict to some degree the danger is always there, isn't it?\"\n\nRichard was infamously sacked from children's TV programme Blue Peter in 1998 after he admitted taking cocaine and he has said there is a link between alcohol consumption and his desire for the drug.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe continued: \"When I've been through periods of my life where I have been using cocaine, it's only (after) two or three drinks where I quite fancy that as well.\"\n\nIn 2018, Richard fell ill during a flight from Los Angeles to London and was put in an induced coma as doctors fought to save his life.\n\nThe latest episode of Hooked, featuring Richard Bacon, is available on BBC Sounds.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
