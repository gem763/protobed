The first trailer for the film was released today and it contains this description of the story:\n\nThe world is first introduced to Richard Jewell as the security guard who reports finding the device at the 1996 Atlanta bombing\u2014his report making him a hero whose swift actions save countless lives. But within days, the law enforcement wannabe becomes the FBI\u2019s number one suspect, vilified by press and public alike, his life ripped apart. Reaching out to independent, anti-establishment attorney Watson Bryant, Jewell staunchly professes his innocence. But Bryant finds he is out of his depth as he fights the combined powers of the FBI, GBI and APD to clear his client\u2019s name, while keeping Richard from trusting the very people trying to destroy him.\n\nThe film is based upon a 1997 story published in Vanity Fair. Here\u2019s a sample of that piece focusing on the FBI and the media:\n\nThis case has everything\u2014the F.B.I., the press, the violation of the Bill of Rights, from the First to the Sixth Amendment,\u201d Watson Bryant told me in one of our first conversations. It has become common to characterize the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Richard Jewell as the epitome of false accusation. The phrase \u201cthe Jewell syndrome,\u201d a rush to judgment, has entered the language of newsrooms and First Amendment forums. On the night of Jewell\u2019s press conference, a commentator on CNN\u2019s Crossfire compared Jewell\u2019s situation to \u201cKafka in Prague.\u201d The case became an investigative catastrophe, which laid bare long-simmering resentments of many F.B.I. career professionals regarding the micromanagement style and imperious attitude of Louis Freeh and his inner circle of former New York prosecutors, who have worked together since their days at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District\u2026 When Jewell returned home from F.B.I. headquarters just before eight p.m., NBC was showing special Olympic coverage. He sat on the sofa and watched Tom Brokaw say, \u201cThey probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still holes in this case.\u201d Jewell knew that Brokaw was his mother\u2019s favorite newsman; he looked at her and noticed \u201cthe color and the blood flow out of her face when she heard that.\u201d Bobi turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d Jewell later recalled, \u201cBrokaw was talking about her son as a murderer.\u2026 She started crying, and what am I going to say to her? \u2018Mom, Watson is going to fix this\u2019? What do you say? She doesn\u2019t hear anything anyway\u2014she was in hysterics.\u201d At that point, Jewell said, he broke down as well.\n\nJewell was eventually cleared of any involvement and Eric Rudolph pleaded guilty to the bombing which killed one person. Jewell wound up suing a number of news outlets for libel. NBC settled and paid Jewell $500,000. CNN and the New York Post also settled for undisclosed sums. Only the Atlanta Journal-Constitution refused to settle.\n\nClint Eastwood is known as one of the few Republicans in Hollywood and has expressed support for President Trump. So the film\u2019s focus on an FBI making serious errors and a media rushing to judgment en masse seems somewhat timely to say the least. The phrase \u201cfake news\u201d wasn\u2019t around in 1996 but if it had been, the media\u2019s treatment of Richard Jewell would have been Exhibit A. Here\u2019s the trailer. I have to say this looks pretty good to me.", "description": "\"...the epitome of false accusation.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Richard-Jewell.jpg"}
