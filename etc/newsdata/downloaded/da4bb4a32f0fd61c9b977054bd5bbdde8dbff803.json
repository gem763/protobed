Obviously, if they want to upgrade the fixtures, then they will pay extra.\"\n\nSome developers are even allowing these modifications up until nearly the end of the construction period, which is a distinct change in the approach from when the markets were running hot.\n\nGreg and Cathy Clark spent $80,000 to fully bespoke their apartment in Turramurra, Sydney's Upper North Shore. James Brickwood\n\n\"We found this is a bit of a phenomenon that we've had to run and work with the market,\" said Capital Bluestone project director Matt Crews.\n\nSydney buyer Greg Clark is among those who are taking advantage of the developers' new level of flexibility.\n\nHe and his family decided to downsize from their large house in Wahroonga, in Sydney's Upper North Shore and bought the entire top floor of a property in Turramurra for $1.8 million.\n\nThe family wanted to change the floorplan of the three apartments into two dwellings \u2013 a three-bedroom for themselves, and a two-bedroom for their children.\n\n\"We worked with the architects to come up with four different sets of plans and then decided on what we thought would be the best one to adopt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We changed the location of the kitchen and laundry and added an extra bathroom for guests,\" said Mr Clark.\n\n\"We've also replaced all the drawers and upgraded the fixtures and appliances. This costs us about $80,000 but we got what we wanted.\"\n\nAoyuan International head of development Adrian Liaw said that while some developers have adopted all sorts of incentives to lure buyers, including offering cash backs and huge discounts, his company opted to offer flexibility instead.\n\n\"What we found is that buyers are generally looking for a better product, whether it's an amalgamated product or a purpose-built home for them,\" he said.\n\n\"So we sit with them and work out what they want to do with their apartment. If it's possible, we will come up with a product that suits their needs.\"\n\nThe race to attract off-the-plan buyers highlights the ongoing challenge for the sector.\n\nA CoreLogic data showed that in August, 60 per cent of Sydney off-the-plan apartments were worth lower at settlement, while 53 per cent of Melbourne units received a lower valuation than the contract price.\n\nThe ABS June data on building activity showed there were still 57,800 units under construction across NSW and almost 50,000 in Victoria.\n\nWhile construction activity is winding down, the number of units being built remains around 40 per cent above the decade average in both markets.", "description": "Off-the-plan buyers are being offered unprecedented flexibility to customise their apartments including reconfiguring the entire floor plan for free.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1766%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a7b5c79e016da4b6df7fcf08b3d2c5fba08329f6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
