He smacked down a whole bunch of papers on the table and said, you all asked for this meeting, I reluctantly agreed to it. No one had asked for the meeting. And Speaker Pelosi, just very professionally, said, Mr. President, we didn\u2019t ask for a meeting, we asked for a briefing from the secretaries of defense, state, and intelligence to understand the consequences of your actions. And he said, well, then let\u2019s end the meeting. And she said, well, while I\u2019m here, it\u2019s my duty as the speaker to tell you that the House has just passed\u2026a resolution opposing your decision and calling upon a strategy for ISIS.

He was, I believe, denigrating to the speaker, called her a third-rate politician, suggested that the Kurds are Communists, and therefore, all you Democrats must be very happy with that. And it just went downward from there.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Robert Menendez (D-NJ) stated that during a White | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Menendez-1016-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
