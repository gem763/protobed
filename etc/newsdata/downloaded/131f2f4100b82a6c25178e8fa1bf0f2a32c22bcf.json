The Trump administration accuses Iran of using proxy forces to target Washington\u2019s allies where they are most vulnerable: focusing on Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy infrastructure and Western-linked ships transiting the Persian Gulf and neighboring waters.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities initially cut the kingdom\u2019s production in half and caused a spike in global oil prices.\n\nBoth Washington and Riyadh have presented physical evidence and other details that they said bolstered their assertions of direct Iranian culpability.\n\nBut as tensions simmer, Trump himself has sent mixed signals over Washington\u2019s willingness to respond with force. \u201cThere are many options. There\u2019s the ultimate option, and there are options a lot less than that,\u201d the president told reporters in Los Angeles, while announcing a move to increase sanctions on Iran.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday, Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Iran was \u201cin some way responsible\u201d for Saturday\u2019s attacks but stopped short of asserting that the drones and missiles that officials have said were involved in the attack had been launched directly from Iran. \u201cRegardless of whether this was a proxy or a direct attack, this has been a dramatic escalation from what we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nHoffman declined to say what actions the United States might take but said the Trump administration wanted to get \u201cback on the diplomatic path.\u201d \u201cOur goal is to deter conflict in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nCol. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a team of U.S. military forensic experts is continuing its work at the attack sites. He declined to say whether the Pentagon would position additional forces in the region.\n\nMilitary leaders are expected to join Cabinet officials on Friday as they present Trump with options for responding to the strikes.\n\nPompeo, in his remarks Thursday, said more sanctions are needed to stop Iran.\n\n\u201cWe have set about a course of action to deny Iran the capacity and wealth to prevent them from conducting their terror campaigns, and you can see from the events of last week there is still more work to do,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday, a spokesman for the Saudi military, Col. Turki al-Malki, said Saturday\u2019s attack on the Abqaiq oil processing plant in eastern Saudi Arabia had involved 18 unmanned aerial vehicles. Seven cruise missiles, he added, were fired at a facility in Khurais, the site of one of the kingdom\u2019s largest oil fields.\n\nThese strikes were, he said, \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nSaudi officials have not determined the location from where the weapons were launched, though Malki declared, \u201cThis attack did not originate from Yemen, despite Iran\u2019s best effort to make it appear so.\n\n\u201cTheir collaboration with their proxy in the region to create this false narrative is clear,\u201d he said, basing the assertion in part on the purported range of the weapons recovered, which he said could not have traveled from territory in Yemen held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement.\n\n[Pompeo calls attacks on Saudi oil facilities \u2018act of war\u2019 as Trump orders increase in sanctions on Iran]\n\nThe Houthis have been fighting a nearly five-year war against a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nA U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address internal deliberations, said that Saudi Arabia had been under \u201cpretty much daily\u201d attacks from Yemen since May. According to the Saudi government, Houthi rebels have fired more than 66,000 rockets and artillery pieces into Saudi Arabia since the beginning of their war with the kingdom in 2015. Saudi officials say those attacks have killed more than 100 civilians.\n\nWhile the Saudi military has defenses directed at those threats from the south, the defense official said, \u201cthe bottom line is that they don\u2019t have enough to protect in every direction or every asset.\u201d\n\nNow, given the recent attacks, the official said the Trump administration would \u201chave to make a decision about whether or not it\u2019s going to assist Saudi Arabia in its defense.\u201d\n\nIf Trump did approve such a step, the Pentagon would be likely to position missile defense batteries, including Patriot systems; additional fighter jets; and additional surveillance assets in or around Saudi Arabia. Such a move would also involve sending troops to operate that weaponry.\n\nConsideration of those items was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTehran is able to rely in varying degrees on a web of proxy forces from Yemen to Lebanon and Iraq, raising the stakes of any U.S. confrontation with Iran.\n\nIn Iran, officials have described the growing hostility as a direct response to U.S. sanctions, which are crippling Iran\u2019s economy. Zarif said sanctions relief \u201ccould change Tehran\u2019s calculations, opening the possibility for talks.\u201d\n\nThe Houthis also reiterated its claim that it carried out the attacks with domestically designed weaponry.\n\n\u201cOur forces have reached a high level of efficiency and ability. They can manufacture various types of unmanned aerial vehicles in record time,\u201d Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a news conference late Wednesday.\n\nThe Houthi claim has been met with skepticism from experts and government officials, especially in light of the nature of war-torn Yemen\u2019s economy and industrial capacity.\n\n\u201cThe Houthis . . . announced that they launched this attack. That lacks credibility,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a French TV station on Thursday. He also called the strikes an \u201cact of war,\u201d although he declined to speculate who was behind them.\n\nThe U.S. government, meantime has issued visas permitting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Zarif to travel to New York for the United Nations annual meeting next week. Rouhani was contemplating skipping the visit if the visas were not issued promptly, Iranian state media reported Wednesday. On Thursday, a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations said the visas had been granted.\n\nThe United States this summer blackballed Zarif from coming to the United States as part of its sanctions campaign aiming to get Iran to re-negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal. But as the \u201chost\u201d nation of U.N. headquarters, the United States has agreed to issue visas to diplomats traveling to New York on official U.N. business.\n\nLoveluck reported from Baghdad.
