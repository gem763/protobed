It has been a fast and distressing week in Syria", "language": "en", "text": "A coolly distant White House missive last Sunday evening, informing that the US would neither condone or condemn a Turkish invasion of Syria, very soon had on-the-ground ramifications.\n\nBy Wednesday, Turkey\u2019s \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d had begun, and Syria\u2019s nearly nine-year civil war was given a new chapter. Donald Trump\u2019s apparently ill-thought out decision \u2013 following a phone call with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 was quickly and widely torn apart, by friends and enemies alike.\n\nFormer military generals, key Republican supporters \u2013 including Lindsey Graham \u2013 foreign governments and Trump\u2019s own former Isis envoy were unanimous in decrying Trump\u2019s effective greenlighting of Turkey\u2019s longed-for incursion into Syria as a needlessly dangerous move. It was a decision, everyone seemed to believe, with no discernible positive outcomes at all.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Kurdish autonomous experiment looked to be over. Years of relative stability \u2013 and freedom \u2013 were coming to an end. Bloodshed and humanitarian catastrophe seemed inevitable \u2013 and soon were.\n\nTo those of us who have been following the Syrian civil war since early 2011, it was momentous. But how to convey this to those readers who may have understandably become jaded by years of coverage of a seemingly interminable war?\n\nWhile the facts on the ground almost spoke for themselves \u2013 dozens of civilians killed, 130,000 people fleeing their homes, hundreds of detainees \u2013 many of them Isis relatives \u2013 on the loose \u2013 it was important to get a sense of what was unfolding on the ground.\n\nHastily making arrangements for our correspondent based in Turkey \u2013 Borzou Daragahi \u2013 to return from another reporting trip, and for Richard Hall \u2013 based in Beirut \u2013 to travel to northeast Syria overground from Iraq \u2013 events on the ground soon overtook any plans we could make.\n\nAnd when on Sunday evening, Kurdish forces in northern Syria announced an ad-hoc alliance with Damascus \u2013 designed at preventing further bloodshed at the hands of Turkish forces \u2013 our plans were dashed. All foreign journalists, wary of Syrian regime detention, were leaving northern Syria.\n\nBut when Bel Trew interviewed a Qamishli resident, Sharine Salih, about the situation there \u2013 the bloodied bodies and Turkish airstrikes \u2013 we were able to, hopefully, convey a sense of the disaster. \u201cThe freshly wounded people and the dead keep arriving,\u201d she wrote, of the local hospital.\n\nWith Borzou now filing from the Turkish border, and Richard reaching out to Kurdish contacts gained from years of reporting in the field, we can attempt to paint a fuller picture of what is happening there.\n\nWhat comes next is very unclear, and it seems hard to believe that yet another front has opened in this most horrific of civil wars. And that it likely didn\u2019t have to happen at all.\n\nYours,\n\nOlivia Alabaster\n\nInternational Editor", "description": "A coolly distant White House missive last Sunday evening, informing that the US would neither condone or condemn a Turkish invasion of Syria, very soon had on-the-ground ramifications.", "authors": ["Olivia Alabaster"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/17/Qamishli.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
