You might think you can. But you can\u2019t.\n\nYou can\u2019t have a BA gold card either, or do a promotional tour for the latest lousy film you flew to Los Angeles to make, or be a shill for a company producing SUVs like Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nCertainly, you can\u2019t walk around with Petronas emblazoned across your chest, or be part of an industry that measures its carbon footprint much like a small country, and pontificate about a lunch-hour chicken sandwich as if it is the root of society\u2019s ills.\n\nLewis Hamilton can\u2019t be a Formula One driver and lecture people on how to save the planet\n\nSo while Lewis Hamilton may care deeply about the world in which we live, Fernando Alonso is right: he doesn\u2019t get to lecture on how to live in it.\n\nHamilton is on the brink of a sixth drivers\u2019 championship, one more than Juan Manuel Fangio, one less than Michael Schumacher.\n\nHe is fast closing in on becoming the greatest of all time. It is a fabulous achievement, but one that comes at a cost. We all know it, and we can all see it.\n\nAt a time of climate crisis, F1 is a very expensive luxury. Not just the races but the circus around them. Go to Abu Dhabi in grand prix week, the huge yachts in the harbour, the parties, the megawatt illumination of the track. You could see those lights from space. And, by then, F1\u2019s race has usually long been run, and won.\n\nSo Hamilton has a choice, and it isn\u2019t about beef versus beetroot. If he announced this season was it, and he was ending his participation in motor sport with its reckless consumption and pollution of the planet\u2019s resources, that would be a very admirable stand.\n\nIf he said he would travel the world by bicycle, planting trees to offset his carbon footprint to this point, he could get Greta Thunberg levels of approval. Yet turning vegan and hectoring the world to follow? This is not the moment to ascend to the moral high ground. It never is in an F1 car.\n\nVeganism makes no real difference to Hamilton, so is no sacrifice at all. Indeed, for an athlete in his sport, it may even be advantageous.\n\nFernando Alonso (L) is right: Hamilton (R) doesn\u2019t get to lecture on how to live on this planet\n\nHamilton needs to stay slim, stay light, stay fit, and there are plenty of incredible and successful athletes who do not eat meat, such as Venus Williams and Jermain Defoe.\n\nHamilton probably likes vegetables almost as much as he likes flying around the world to drive very fast cars. Yet you\u2019ll notice he\u2019s not giving that up.\n\nSo he\u2019s green right up until the moment it starts to impact on him, which is what one might term \u2018Celebrity Green\u2019. That\u2019s the newest green, the greenest green.\n\nCelebrity Green is never going to be pulled off the roof of a train at Canning Town station and beaten up by commuters. Celebrity Green doesn\u2019t do much public transport or economy class.\n\nCelebrity Green is Emma Thompson flying 5,400 miles from Los Angeles to protest about climate change. Celebrity Green is the Duke and Duchess of Sussex chauffeured to their next private jet. Celebrity Green is an Extinction Rebellion cameo followed by a party at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nDo we really need anyone going transatlantic to make the third sequel to Men In Black? It\u2019s not art. It\u2019s not even very good. Don\u2019t they have actors in Hollywood any more? Can\u2019t someone just come by bus?\n\nGreen until it affects us: now there\u2019s a slogan the world of celebrity can get behind, and appear not at all hypocritical. Green until I can\u2019t do what I want. If there is, as Hamilton rightly states, an environmental argument for veganism, there is one for putting racing cars out to grass.\n\nEver been to Formula One? It isn\u2019t two days of brief speed trials, and then a race. It\u2019s three solid days of fast-car noise, sun up to sundown. Three solid days of massive freight and people movements, three solid days of burning petrol, three solid days of massive human consumption.\n\nEveryone has got to get there, everyone has got to get back, and many drive or fly because the circuits are rarely central. And when they are there, they eat, they drink, they take up hotels, all those bright lights, all that energy.\n\nYachts line up in the harbour at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as a Mercedes passes on the track\n\nSome of the tracks are floodlit for night racing, and some F1 races are held at night, too, because the timing is better for a global market. The idea somebody in this game turns to the general public and questions the contents of their lunchbox is quite breathtaking.\n\n\u2018We all know the lifestyle that Lewis has and that F1 drivers take 200 planes a year,\u2019 said Alonso. \u2018You can\u2019t then say don\u2019t eat meat.\u2019 Well, you can, but don\u2019t be surprised at the reaction.\n\nHere\u2019s the maths. There are 10 F1 teams carrying between 50 and 100 tons of cars, car parts and equipment to 21 races, amounting to 110,000 air miles each year. With the cars go drivers and mechanics, and with them go fancy mobile headquarters and hospitality centres for sponsors and guests.\n\nSo that\u2019s 1.1million air miles at a rate of five gallons of jet fuel per mile, meaning 5.5m gallons of fuel just to race.\n\nBut F1 teams don\u2019t just race. They test, they promote, they serve the needs of the manufacturers and their sponsors. Hamilton in a Mercedes car is advertising a product just as sincerely as Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Benedict Cumberbatch is flogging his Chinese SUVs when he thinks no one is looking.\n\nIf we speculate that a quarter of F1 activity is devoted to journeys that are not race-specific, this is an industry burning roughly 7m gallons of jet fuel each year.\n\nAnd this does not include the emissions of the car production and testing sites, or the journeys of between 300 and 600 employees to and from work. What do you think powers a wind tunnel that tests aerodynamics, for instance?\n\nHamilton performs donuts in his Mercedes car after winning Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix\n\nAnyway, back to jet fuel. One gallon creates 21 pounds of carbon dioxide, so 7million gallons creates 147million pounds of carbon dioxide.\n\nThis puts F1\u2019s carbon footprint \u2014 and this is a very conservative estimate, remember, because it doesn\u2019t include the production incidentals, plus the footprint of fans, suppliers and the entire infrastructure of a grand prix event, including much meat eating \u2014 at roughly the same as the annual CO2 emissions of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a self-governing overseas territory of France, near Canada, with a population in excess of 6,000.\n\n\u2018I know we are travelling around the world and racing Formula One cars, our carbon footprint is higher than the average homeowner who lives in the same city,\u2019 Hamilton said. \u2018But that doesn\u2019t mean you should be afraid to speak out about things.\u2019\n\nActually, it does. Not afraid, maybe, but at least aware. To even think that F1\u2019s carbon footprint is comparable to a homeowner beggars belief.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m always looking at how I can improve the effect that I\u2019m having on the world,\u2019 said Hamilton, and that might be true. He is selling his collection of vintage, gas-hungry cars. He no longer has his private jet.\n\nYet every time he races, every time the giant caravan rolls on to its next destination \u2014 the last eight events this season pass through Italy, Singapore, Russia, Japan, Mexico, the USA, Brazil and Abu Dhabi \u2014 Hamilton is compromised.\n\nYay for salad and all that, but if Hamilton really wanted to save the planet he needs to delve a little deeper into the 0.07 megaton world he inhabits and seems rather reluctant to leave behind.\n\nHaka is a drain on All Blacks\n\nTalking to a broadcaster for Maori TV before England\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, he had an interesting view on the haka.\n\nHe said that far from being an advantage to the All Blacks, it had taken on such importance, had become so overblown in its significance to the players, that it was detrimental.\n\nHe thought too much energy was put into the ceremony, and it actually sapped strength rather than built it.\n\nThat\u2019s not the popular view in New Zealand, or beyond, yet watching the match on Saturday, it did not seem as if the All Blacks were ready to match England\u2019s aggression and tempo from the start.\n\nThe haka is a challenge, and when England accepted it so readily, it was almost as if New Zealand didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nNew Zealand perform the haka in front of England ahead of their Rugby World Cup semi-final\n\nThe high price of fighting racism\n\nFor Haringey Borough, standing up to racist abuse has come at a cost.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Yeovil visit Coles Park a second time, their fans will be housed in a different part of the ground, and for that the Isthmian League club has to install new toilets.\n\nAs this rearranged fixture is now a night game, extra external perimeter lighting is also required to escort the away fans to their new section. The total cost is \u00a35,000.\n\nAt Haringey\u2019s level, where \u00a3100 is a decent weekly salary, that is a lot of money.\n\nGiven that the racist abuse suffered by goalkeeper Valery Douglas Pajetat has never been disputed, by either side, and that according to Haringey chairman Aki Achillea it can be viewed on film, one wonders why this tie needs to be played at all.\n\nThere is Tuesday's date for the rearranged fixture and another, November 5, if the match is drawn. Surely in this time, an FA committee could have sat and simply awarded the tie to Haringey Borough.\n\nThat way the racists would have knocked their own club out of the FA Cup, cost their own club money, and a valuable lesson would be learned.\n\nNo doubt, because the police are involved, the FA will say they cannot pre-empt a court case in any way that is prejudicial. Yet we have seen before that our courts carry a different burden of proof to FA hearings. They are separate processes; ask John Terry.\n\nGiving the tie to Haringey would have set a precedent \u2014 one that is still evidence-based \u2014 and sent a message. Instead, what are we learning here? That principles are expensive. At the least, the FA should have banned Yeovil fans from travelling. And if they can\u2019t do that, they should write Haringey\u2019s cheque.\n\nRefs are running and ruining VAR\n\nIt must be horrid to be one of the folk who put such faith in VAR, to then see how poorly it has been handled in the Premier League. Every weekend a fresh travesty, each round of matches a new and increasingly counter-productive interpretation of the rules.\n\nAgainst Brighton on Saturday, Michael Keane of Everton trod on Aaron Connolly\u2019s foot. It happens. Keane is prone to clumsiness, but this was entirely accidental.\n\nBoth men were looking at the ball when they came together. We all know the difference between this and a mistimed tackle. One is a foul, regardless of intent, the other a part of contact sport.\n\nPlayers get in each other\u2019s way. They don\u2019t mean to, and Connolly\u2019s reaction was shamefully over the top. It won Brighton a penalty from Lee Mason, who was advising Andy Madley. And on it goes, these ludicrous interpretations.\n\nReferees support VAR, apparently, because the process gets the blame, not them. But it is referees who are running it, and ruining it, and they are responsible for the mounting dissatisfaction.\n\nMichael Keane was adjudged to have fouled Aaron Connolly (right) inside the area\n\nXhaka not captain fantastic\n\nTurns out Granit Xhaka isn\u2019t captaincy material. Seriously, who knew? Oh, that\u2019s right, everybody outside Arsenal.\n\nWomen's football needs more than gimmicks\n\nFurther to the argument made by Casey Stoney about the folly of papering the hall for women\u2019s football in outsized stadiums, a case in point would appear to be Atletico Madrid Femenino.\n\nIt is their gate for a match against Barcelona at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium last season that is often cited as the way forward, drawing a crowd of 60,739 to a game that was heavily promoted, but with more than half the attendees let in for nothing.\n\nThe effect? Negligible. Their next home match, against Real Betis, drew 613 and this season Madrid\u2019s opening two league games have pulled 1,200 and 750.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain\u2019s women footballers are poised to strike over issues around the minimum wage, maternity policies, holidays and injuries.\n\nThe players\u2019 union wants a framework in place across all clubs, which would seem far more progressive than gimmicks that make for a headline one week, but have little lasting effect.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER:You can't be a Formula One driver and lecture on saving the planet.
