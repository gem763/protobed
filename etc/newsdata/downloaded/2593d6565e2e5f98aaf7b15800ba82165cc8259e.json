She declined to disclose details.\n\nThe captain and four crew members were the only survivors of the pre-dawn Labor Day fire off the Channel Islands that killed 34 people, whom authorities say were trapped below deck by the fast-spreading blaze.\n\nHomendy said none of the survivors tested positive for alcohol, and drug test results were pending.\n\nThe boat\u2019s fire protection systems also will be checked. The Coast Guard said the vessel wasn\u2019t required to have sprinklers.\n\nFox 11 reported that the NTSB will have a preliminary report on the investigation in 10 days, which likely will include factual information but not a probable cause.\n\nOnly one person remained missing Wednesday after searchers recovered 33 bodies from the charred underwater wreckage.\n\nThe victims included an engineer for Apple who went on the trip with his wife and daughter to celebrate the teen\u2019s 17th birthday, a special effects designer for Disney, a nature photographer, a nurse and a physics teacher from Northern California who was with his 26-year-old daughter.\n\nFIRE BLOCKS ESCAPE FOR 34 BOAT OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST, INVESTIGATORS SAY\n\nThose aboard also included students from Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz, a public charter school for grades 7 through 12, the school said.\n\nThe only crew member to die was 26-year-old Allie Kurtz, who had quit her corporate job at Paramount Pictures to work on dive boats and recently had been promoted to deckhand on the Conception.\n\nFlames moved quickly through the 75-foot vessel, blocking a narrow stairway and an escape hatch leading to the upper decks, investigators said.\n\nDNA will be needed to identify the victims. Investigators will use the same rapid analysis tool that identified victims of the deadly wildfire that devastated the Northern California town of Paradise last year, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nThe fire started shortly after 3 a.m. Monday as the boat sat anchored in Platt\u2019s Harbor off Santa Cruz Island, among the rugged, wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCoast Guard records show fire safety violations on the Conception in 2014 and 2016 were quickly fixed.
