The process, the Constitution framer writes, is meant for offenses \u201cdenominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nPolitical offenses are, by nature, politicized. They \u201cagitate the passions of the whole community\u201d and \u201cdivide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.\u201d The danger, Hamilton says, is that the impeachment process will be decided \u201cmore by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\u201d If that proves either the perception or the reality of impeachment, the process loses its legitimacy, and America loses critical protection against tyrants and criminals.\n\nEverything, then, rests on the independence and authority of the body charged with impeachment. Hamilton admitted that there was no tribunal capable of \u201cthe most exact standard of perfection,\u201d but the best possible hope lay with the Senate. He believed that no \u201cother body would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE.\u201d\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nPresident Donald Trump faces impeachment after repeatedly asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s chief domestic political rival, a week after Trump froze the country\u2019s military aid. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky brought up the aid, Trump responded, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d and turned the conversation to Biden. All of this is confirmed in a call record released by Trump\u2019s own White House.\n\nHamilton wrote in defense of a political system he thought would resist organized political parties. Today, the Senate makes no pretense to impartiality. The modern Senate, like the House, is controlled by a political party \u2014 and it is the political party Trump leads.\n\n\u201cIf this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand,\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Politico.\n\n\u201cThe Senate will never convict President Trump,\u201d his longtime No. 2, Sen. John Cornyn, said before even reading the whistleblower\u2019s report.\n\nImpeachment was meant to be a political remedy for political offenses. But over time, it has mutated into something quite different: a partisan remedy for political offenses. And partisan remedies are subject to partisan considerations. If Trump falls before an impeachment trial, the Republican Party will be left in wreckage. The GOP\u2019s leaders can\u2019t permit the destruction of their own party. They will protect Trump at all costs.\n\n\u201cI think we have seen the total collapse of this very basic obligation of Congress under the weight of partisan polarization \u2014 particularly on the right \u2014 and it is dramatic,\u201d says Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \u201cTrump has exposed it rather than triggered it.\u201d\n\nThere have been only three serious presidential impeachment efforts in American history. Every single one of them came when Congress was controlled by the opposition party. \u201cImpeachment has essentially never been effective, except maybe as a deterrent,\u201d says Matt Glassman, who is a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute.\n\nBut deterrents matter. Rather than focusing on what impeachment cannot do, it\u2019s worth looking at what it can. The impeachment process, as it stands now, is broken. It almost certainly will not lead to Trump\u2019s removal, no matter how damning the investigation\u2019s findings. But that doesn\u2019t make it useless. It can act as a sanction to Trump and his successors, unearth information voters will need when deciding whether to reelect Trump, and provide a warning to foreign countries that would seek influence over our politics.\n\nThat is not sufficient, but it will have to be enough.\n\n1) Impeachment as public disgrace\n\n\u201cWe tend to think of impeachment as a mechanism of removal,\u201d says Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, \u201cbut it tends to be used as a mechanism of sanction. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t get to be president anymore. It\u2019s that you\u2019ve done something very bad and we\u2019ll tell everyone and publicize it. \u201d\n\nImpeachment acts as a form of public disgrace. To be one of only four impeached presidents in American history, even if you are not convicted by the Senate, is to know an asterisk will be forever attached to your presidency, your offenses prominently recorded. It\u2019s a humiliation for you and a warning to your successors.\n\nThat\u2019s one way in which impeachment acts as a deterrent. It\u2019s a statement that a particular action falls outside the boundaries of normal American politics, that the behavior violated the public trust in a historic fashion.\n\nThis is not as strong a punishment as removal from office, of course. But it\u2019s a stronger punishment than some Democrats issuing critical press releases before moving onto other issues. And it may yet lead to removal from office.\n\n2) Impeachment and the 2020 election\n\nIn impeachment, the House\u2019s role is to bring and try the case, while the Senate\u2019s role is to judge the accused. The problem facing the country right now is that Senate leadership has flatly stated that it would never, under any circumstances, convict the accused. Given the two-thirds supermajority required for removal, McConnell and Cornyn\u2019s guarantees hold weight.\n\nBut the Senate isn\u2019t the only possible judge of an impeachment case. In 2020, Americans will go to the polls to vote for the next president. If the House conducts a serious, thorough impeachment investigation, the revelations of that inquiry will inform their choice. Indeed, if Senate Republicans are stonewalling accountability for a clearly corrupt president, it may affect Americans\u2019 choices in Senate elections, too.\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s offense is directly relevant to the 2020 election. In trying the case before the \u201cjudge\u201d of the 2020 electorate, House Democrats will be elevating Trump\u2019s offense to the proper jury.\n\nA well-constructed impeachment inquiry will harm Trump\u2019s reelection bid. Of course, the flip is that an ill-constructed impeachment drive will boost it. But House Democrats seem intent on building their case carefully. Speaker Pelosi resisted impeachment after the Mueller report, in part because the absence of collusion made it a weak case for impeachment.\n\nNow Trump has attempted collusion in the plain text of a call record released by his own White House, and the case for impeachment is markedly stronger. Where Democrats were split on the impeachment question after Mueller, Republicans are the ones who are beginning to split, with Vermont\u2019s GOP governor backing impeachment.\n\nTrump wanted to run for reelection atop a booming economy. Now he will run as the candidate arguing that his demands of Ukraine did not quite rise to the level of quid pro quo. It\u2019s not a great bumper sticker.\n\n3) Impeachment is a message to foreign countries\n\nIn 2016, Russia reached into the US presidential election to help elect Donald Trump. Its investment was returned in spades. Trump, perhaps pleased by the result and emboldened by the wan aftermath of the Mueller investigation, subsequently asked Ukraine to launch an investigation on his behalf, in an effort to undermine one of his most formidable domestic political rivals.\n\nThe question for any foreign country facing an opportunity or request to intervene in America\u2019s election is what they may gain and what they may lose. For Ukraine, the potential gains were clear: military aid and anything else that might flow from nurturing Trump\u2019s goodwill.\n\nThe spotlight of impeachment makes the costs clearer, too. A foreign country that is asked to intervene in an American election may see its activities exposed, much to the fury of the other political party and the public. Ukraine may want Trump\u2019s goodwill, but it doesn\u2019t want the Democrats\u2019 ill will or the distraction and infamy of this investigation.\n\nImpeachment, in this case, acts as a message to other countries. \u201cThere is an element of saying to foreign governments, \u2018We\u2019re not going to allow this to happen,\u2019\u201d says Mason. \u201cIt may just be theater, but it\u2019s necessary theater to protect American elections.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is broken, but not useless\n\nIn his farewell address, President George Washington spoke against \u201cthe common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party.\u201d In particular, he warned that partisan infighting \u201copens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions.\u201d\n\nWe live now in the world Washington feared. Party polarization has broken the American political system\u2019s mechanisms of accountability. Republicans have fallen in line behind Trump, placing their loyalty to him, and to each other, above any sense of public accountability. And in doing, they have opened American politics to foreign influence and corruption \u2014 both from opportunists, like Russia, and enlisted allies of Trump\u2019s, like Ukraine.\n\nA system of partisan accountability often means no system of accountability at all. It creates eras in which corruption flourishes, so long as that corruption is to the benefit of the party in power. That American politics has no answer for official wrongdoing in periods of unified government is chilling. Elections are not, on their own, sufficient \u2014 without rigorous systems of oversight, investigation, and accountability, the public often doesn\u2019t know of the wrongdoing it should punish.\n\nHamilton wasn\u2019t, in the end, just the author of Federalist 65. He was also the author of much of Washington\u2019s farewell address. Sadly, it\u2019s his pessimism about an America driven by party, rather than his optimism about the Senate, that rings true today.\n\nStill, even a broken impeachment process has its uses. The Senate may refuse its role, but through a properly designed impeachment process, the House can focus the public\u2019s attention, send a message to the world, and create a record for the future.", "description": "The case for impeachment, even if it can\u2019t oust Trump.", "authors": ["Ezra Klein", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oT_2JInD2reAEDuAkPsBsULuAY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19236907/GettyImages_969746660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
