But the Hollywood Reporter puts the deal at \u201cbillions,\u201d and says it is \u201ceasily a record-setting five-year deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cFew shows define a generation and capture mainstream zeitgeist like \u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u201d said Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and direct-to-consumer, in a statement to THR. \u201cThis show has been a hit virtually around the globe, it\u2019s one of the biggest shows on broadcast television of the last decade, and the fact that we get to bring it to a streaming platform for the first time in the U.S. is a coup for our new offering.\u201d HBO did not respond to a MarketWatch request for comment.\n\nRelated: NBC\u2019s \u2018Peacock\u2019 streaming service to launch in April with \u2018The Office\u2019 and \u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest shot in the streaming services\u2019 battle over the rights to pop culture\u2019s most beloved reruns.\n\nHBO Max also recently paid $425 million over five years to snag all 236 episodes of \u201cFriends\u201d away from Netflix NFLX, +1.46%. (\u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d are both produced by WarnerMedia, and a person close to the matter told the WSJ that Warner Bros. didn\u2019t shop \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d to other streaming services \u2014 unlike \u201cThe Office,\u201d which was shopped to services like Hulu, Netflix and Apple AAPL, +0.36% before going home to NBCUniversal.)\n\nSo when HBO Max launches next spring, it will attempt to lure viewers with both \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d as well as legacy British sci-fi series \u201cDoctor Who\u201d (another catalog it recently snapped up) for what\u2019s expected to be a $14.99 monthly subscription.\n\nRelated: Apple\u2019s streaming service is cheap, but how does it stack up against Amazon, Netflix and Disney?\n\nDisney+ will launch in November with its own catalog of Marvel, \u201cStar Wars\u201d and classic Disney DIS, +0.38% movies, as well as Disney Channel series. Apple TV+ will launch the same month. And while it hasn\u2019t licensed any major reruns like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d Apple has reportedly spent $6 billion on original content with A-list stars, such as Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, Jason Momoa and Oprah Winfrey, as well as a \u201cSesame Street\u201d spinoff.\n\nBut Netflix managed to bag \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d with news breaking on Monday that it shelled out more than $500 million to Sony Pictures Television SNE, -0.05% for the worldwide rights to the iconic 1990s show about nothing.\n\nJerry &\n\nElaine &\n\nGeorge &\n\nKramer &\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\nAll 180 episodes of the Emmy-Award winning Seinfeld are coming to Netflix \u2014 worldwide! \u2014 starting in 2021 pic.twitter.com/tLvcCKH4vl \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) September 16, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s a huge bump from when Hulu bought six years of domestic rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d for $130 million in 2015. And this was a much-needed win after Netflix lost its most popular TV show, \u201cThe Office,\u201d which will become part of Comcast\u2019s upcoming NBCUniversal Peacock streaming platform in 2021. Netflix will hang onto \u201cFriends\u201d until its current deal ends in December.", "description": "Reports say HBO Max spent between $600 million up to \u201cbillions\u201d for \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d in the streaming war of the reruns.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GO943_big_ba_ZG_20180824150102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
