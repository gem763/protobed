Radar indicated possible tornados in areas around Rhine, Georgia and Vienna, Georgia. But there was no immediate confirmation of any tornadoes and no injuries or damages were reported. Elsewhere, news outlets reported downed trees and power lines in metro Atlanta as heavy rains spread across Georgia. Photographs showed downed trees blocking some roadways in that major city.\n\nNestor made landfall earlier Saturday on Florida's northern Gulf Coast as a post-tropical cyclone after losing its tropical storm status.

All storm surge warnings have been canceled.\n\nThe storm is expected to move northeast through Georgia and into the Carolinas before reaching the Atlantic Ocean late Sunday.\n\n___\n\nNOON\n\nA second suspected tornado spawned by Tropical Storm Nestor has damaged homes in southwest Florida.\n\nThe Cape Coral Police Department said in a statement that about dozen homes were damaged Saturday morning by a possible tornado, some severely.
