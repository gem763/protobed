The tactician from Botshabelo in the Free State disclosed that he used to write and recite poems when he was studying towards a teacher\u2019s diploma at Tshiya College of Education in QwaQwa in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cI was a poet at some stage. And as a poet you become a philosopher, a politician and a traditionalist.\n\n\u201cSo my shirt reflected that side of me,\u201d Ntseki told City Press this week.\n\nHe added that his Africanness was inspired by, among others, renowned Sesotho author KP Maphalla and former president Thabo Mbeki\u2019s famous I am an African speech in Parliament in 1996.\n\nAs for his choice of shirt last Sunday, which he bought at a market in Port Elizabeth on the eve of the game, Ntseki said: \u201cIt was predetermined a long time ago. I had another shirt ready but I changed my mind because I was looking for something closer to the occasion \u2013 to honour the late statesman [Nelson] Mandela. Even the players were surprised because they had expected me to appear on match day in a suit.\n\n\u201cI never wore suits during my days as a teacher. Africa-inspired fashion is the attire I want to wear to promote and also something about us as South Africans.\u201d\n\nWhile the former teacher received full marks on his first test at the helm of Bafana, a sterner examination awaits him in the 2021 Afcon qualifiers that start next month.\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe have just completed the line up in Bafana\u2019s qualifying group after the small nation off the coast of central Africa earned their spot with a 5-2 aggregate win over Mauritius last weekend. South Africa are pitted in Group C, alongside Ghana and Sudan.\n\n\u201cExperiences with the Seychelles have taught us that there are no longer small [footballing] countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll play to win the group and adopting this kind of attitude is to say we view everybody [the opponents] the same way,\u201d warned Ntseki in reference to Bafana being held to a goalless draw by the islanders during the previous Afcon qualifiers.\n\nBafana will start their latest campaign with an away trip to the Black Stars in Kumasi, Ghana, on November 15. They then host Sudan four days later at Orlando Stadium in Soweto.\n\nThe the top two sides across the 12 groups \u2013 from the 48 qualified nations \u2013 will earn a ticket to the continental championships in Cameroon.", "description": "Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki not only started his tenure with a win last Sunday, but the 50-year-old also gave fans a glimpse of his fashion sense while on the touchline.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9371/2e449ec0bae14a73b0fdc73337a630d1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
