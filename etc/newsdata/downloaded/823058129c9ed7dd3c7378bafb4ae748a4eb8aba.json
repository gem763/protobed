I don't think any of the power station owners or operators in this room today have any control over whether large demand loads disappear,\" she told the summit.\n\n\"This is a great example of something that is outside our control that could potentially change the closure date for a large coal-fired power generator.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut other energy observers believe the closure of the Portland smelter is long overdue and will in fact relieve a bit of pressure on the energy grid in south-eastern Australia.\n\nIt could help buy the market operator some time in firming up reserves, removing some demand from the grid and allow any excess supply to be moved across the border into NSW during times of peak demand.\n\nIt would also make it easier for Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio to reach the Labor government's 50 per cent renewable energy target.\n\nThe Portland smelter is no doubt on life support and may yet be saved by other rescue package from the Victorian or federal governments.\n\nThe existing $240 million in subsidies to keep the Portland smelter open - which expire in 15 months - allowed AGL Energy to sign a four-year supply deal with the smelter which runs out in 2021.\n\nThe smelter, which employs 600 people, has been subsidised in some form or another since 1988.\n\nIt once again raises the question about whether Australia should remain in energy intensive industries such as smelters, especially when they are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nAustralia's dramatic rise in power prices over the past decade has made it even harder for us to compete internationally.\n\nAnd the reality remains large smelters are a major drain on the power grid - not to mention big carbon emitters. When black-outs threatened NSW a few years ago, the Tomago smelter - which uses 25 per cent of the state's power supply - was asked to turn off production just to keep the lights on.\n\nThe electricity grid may be changing before our eyes courtesy of the surge in renewable energy as we attempt to move towards a low-emissions economy. The closure of smelters, such as Portland, might just end up being the price of reaching those emission reduction targets.", "description": "The possible closure of Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria is another crunch point for the energy market and economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/064976a7ee2e30e8d7e3df74a1327e75d91b2fd3", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
