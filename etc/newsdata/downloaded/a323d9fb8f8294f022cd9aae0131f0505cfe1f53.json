For more than three years, Renia documented her life in more than 650 handwritten and densely filled pages.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t betray me,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut someone else did.\n\nOn July 30, 1942, Renia, then 18, was summarily executed by the Nazis after they discovered her hideout in the city of Przemysl in southeastern Poland.\n\nMore than half a century later, her translated diary \u2014 strikingly similar in some ways to that of Anne Frank but long kept locked in a vault \u2014 is finally set to be published in the United States. The scheduled release of \u201cRenia\u2019a Diary: A Holocaust Diary\u201d on Tuesday comes at a critical time, as nationalism and right-wing populism have drawn comparisons with the 1930s \u2014 including in the United States, where Renia\u2019s sister Elizabeth Bellak fled with her mother after World War II.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried again,\u201d said Bellak, 88, speaking from a hotel in Warsaw this week, where she was due to attend the screening of an accompanying video documentary by Polish American filmmaker Tomasz Magierski. She expressed hope that her sister\u2019s story would help \u201cremind young and old\u201d of the horrors of that time.\n\nBellak still has not found the strength to read the full diary her sister wrote up to her final days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too emotional, too painful for me,\u201d she said. Renia, as the older sister, \u201cwas like a surrogate mother to me\u201d and a \u201cwonderful, wonderful person.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever her heart was broken, she wrote a poem,\u201d Bellak said.\n\nRenia\u2019s diary indicates how much she cared for her sister, a child movie star in late-1930s Poland, despite occasional discontent over what she saw as her younger sibling\u2019s ability \u201cto steal the show.\"\n\nThree years and about 650 pages\n\nThe diary traces Renia\u2019s path from a teenager worried about the looming threat of Nazism to a victim of the Nazis\u2019 occupation of Poland and their declared mission to exterminate the Jewish people.\n\nWeeks before the invasion of Poland, Renia appeared to sense the growing danger. \u201cMama\u2019s very worried about me. Oh! I\u2019m so unhappy,\u201d she wrote in March 1939. Her mother spent long stretches in the capital, Warsaw, in 1939 and following years, hoping to promote her younger daughter as a movie actress.\n\n\n\nRenia Spiegel, left, with her mother and younger sister in Przemysl, Poland, in 1937.

(Bellak Family Archive)\n\nRenia and her sister stayed behind in southeastern Poland, where Renia continued to document her growing anxiety. But she also wrote about falling in love and trying to go about normal life. Later that year \u2014 still separated from her mother \u2014 Renia wrote of an intensified sense of urgency: \u201cPrzemysl was attacked. We had to flee. The three of us escaped: me, [Elizabeth] and Grandpa. \u2026 Granny stayed behind.\u201d\n\nWeeks later: \u201cHoly God, please give me an easy death.\u201d Within the subsequent three years, in hundreds of detailed entries, Renia documented their family\u2019s transfer into a ghetto, along with thousands of other Jews who were given only 24 hours to move. The Nazis were readying themselves for the later stages of the Holocaust, and their grip on the country was intensifying.\n\nAs the Nazis were preparing to transfer thousands of Jews to a death camp, Renia\u2019s boyfriend, Zygmunt Schwarzer, arranged a desperate attempt to rescue the sisters \u2014 the two were separated from each other and from their grandparents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything to remember our last words to each other. I\u2019d give anything to know that I told her how much I loved her,\u201d Bellak wrote in the book\u2019s afterword about the lost memories of her farewell with Renia.\n\nSeparating from her grandmother was painful, as well. \u201cMy granny, whom I loved so much, turned away, raising her hands to her face,\u201d Bellak recalled.\n\nSoon after their goodbye, the Nazis uncovered Renia\u2019s hideout, and she was executed. The fate of her grandparents is unknown, but Bellak said she believes they were killed and buried in a mass grave.\n\nShe and her mother managed to escape to Austria with the help of a German officer who had fallen in love with the mother, a fluent German speaker. After the war ended, both immigrated to the United States, where they were later joined by Renia\u2019s boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI have something for you,\u201d Bellak recalled Schwarzer saying at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was Renia\u2019s diary, all seven hundred pages of it. My mom and I broke down in tears,\u201d Bellak wrote, recalling the encounter in the early 1950s. Throughout their time together, she had not known that her sister was writing a diary.\n\nAfter the death of Renia and of Schwarzer\u2019s parents \u2014 who had been hiding in the same place \u2014 the boyfriend finished the diary with these words: \u201cFate decided to take my dearest ones away from me. My life is over. All I can hear are shots, shots \u2026 shots.\u201d\n\nBut despite the haunting details \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 Renia\u2019s diary lay virtually untouched in a vault in New York City for more than half a century.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain why I was allowed to live, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried for so long to turn my mind away from it,\u201d Bellak recalled in the afterword of her sister\u2019s diary.\n\nIn New York, Bellak went on to attend Columbia University and later married.\n\nThe diary\u2019s long path to global recognition\n\nWhen her own children started asking about their family\u2019s story, Bellak gradually began opening up.\n\n\u201cWhat was in that book about the aunt?\u201d she recalled her daughter asking repeatedly. \u201cThat\u2019s how it started.\u201d\n\nMagierski and Bellak\u2019s daughter, Alexandra Bellak, played a crucial role in the release of the diary, initially in Polish and now in other languages.\n\n\u201cMy mother was reluctant to talk about it because it unearthed painful memories,\u201d the daughter told The Washington Post. \u201cSo, I thought, well, there\u2019s this elusive diary, sitting in the vault.\u201d The more pages were translated, the more obvious the diary\u2019s literary quality and historical relevance became to her.\n\n\u201cWriting gave her freedom to express herself,\u201d even as \u201cevil and hate all around\u201d mounted, Alexandra Bellak said of Renia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost fortuitous that the diary is being published now \u2026 because the same signs are showing their ugly heads again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more relevant than ever.\u201d\n\nThis week, Elizabeth Bellak returned to Hotel Europejski in Warsaw \u2014 where she and her mother had sought refuge before they eventually fled abroad.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Bellak in Warsaw's Polin Museum. (Silwia Grochowska)\n\n\u201cI survived the war, I survived life, and here I am again after 75 years\u201d \u2014 this time to call attention to the story of her family and its contemporary message, Bellak said by phone from the hotel this week.\n\nThose who read about Renia\u2019s story, Bellak said, \u201cshould try to help the world not to become what it was then.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLong-lost film that predicted rise of anti-Semitism has ominous message for today\u2019s world", "description": "A World War II-era diary, set to be published in the United States, has triggered comparisons with the writings of Anne Frank.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0qvdLDW4ccJNCNW25my0qInz-XQ=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-18-2019/t_6f1d679405c44640bccfd9bf22febb68_name_Screen_Shot_2019_09_18_at_11_42_40_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
