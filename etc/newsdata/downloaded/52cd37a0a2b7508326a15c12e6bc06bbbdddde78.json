He could now miss the Clasico on October 26.\n\n\u201cDembele\u2019s is a mystery,\u201d said Valverde. \u201cIt is very difficult to get words out of him in Spanish, so what he said couldn\u2019t have been very long.\u201d\n\nBy then, the game was long gone as victory pushed Barcelona up to second in the table, two points behind Real Madrid and one above Atletico, who could have done with some of the Catalans\u2019 classy finishing in their goalless draw away at Real Valladolid.\n\nFor all the turbulence and scrutiny on Valverde and Zinedine Zidane, Barca and Madrid head into the international break not only as the league\u2019s two frontrunners but with confidence and momentum too.\n\nEden Hazard scored his first goal for Madrid in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday and Barca\u2019s star man is off the mark as well after his own injury-interrupted start to the season.\n\nThis was Barcelona\u2019s fourth consecutive victory.\n\nMessi\u2019s return has increased the pressure on Antoine Griezmann, who was left out of the starting line-up following his quiet display against Inter. Dembele was preferred on the left of the front three.\n\nSevilla, who drop to sixth, had eight shots to Barcelona\u2019s seven in the first half but were three down at the break.\n\n\u2013 De Jong still waits \u2013\n\nLuuk de Jong is yet to score since his move from PSV Eindhoven last summer and the 29-year-old had four excellent chances to break his duck, three of them before Barca had taken the lead.\n\nHe fired Lucas Ocampos\u2019 pull-back straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen, sidefooted wide and mistimed a header. In the second half, Arthur lost possession on the edge of his box but still De Jong could not capitalise, lashing his shot against the post.\n\nIn between, Barca had already made him pay. Suarez\u2019s effort was probably the pick of the trio in terms of difficulty, as he launched himself into the air, turned and threw his weaker left foot over the ball, and banged it into the net.\n\nFive minutes later it was two, this one a team goal, quite literally, as all of Barca\u2019s players touched the ball in 85 seconds of build-up. Arthur\u2019s cross was the 25th pass, finding the sliding Vidal who was just onside.\n\nThe third three minutes later was about pace and power, and a mistake from Sevilla too, as Arthur robbed Fernando Reges. Dembele raced clear, fooled Diego Carlos with a dummy shot, before guiding the ball into the far corner.\n\nAfter his fourth miss, De Jong was taken off and Messi went close after a barnstorming run. The only surprise was that he had not yet scored and he fixed that in the 78th minute after Sevilla gave him a third attempt at a free-kick. This time he did not miss.\n\nThe 20-year-old defender Araujo had come on for his debut in the 73rd minute and was sent off in the 87th for tugging down Javier Hernandez as Barcelona\u2019s last man. Dembele then saw red after picking up a second yellow card for dissent.\n\nAtletico\u2019s stalemate means they have managed only two wins from their last seven games in all competitions and they could even have lost if Valladolid\u2019s Sandro Ramirez had not skied a first-half penalty. Diego Simeone\u2019s side managed only one shot on target.\n\nValladolid sit 13th, with two wins from eight games.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Barcelona are back in form and La Liga\u2019s big three are back at the top of the table after the defending champions put on a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/4cfdcb_lionel-messi-scored-his-goal-season-in-barcelona-win-sevilla-on-sunday-classy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
