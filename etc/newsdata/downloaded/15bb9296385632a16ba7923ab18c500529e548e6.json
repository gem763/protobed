It was there that she spotted WonderTent Parties, which provides a professionalized sleepover experience.\n\nInstead of mismatched sleeping bags cluttering a living room, the company suggests renting its individual pastel-colored tents stuffed with tiny mattresses, pillows and blankets, starting at $90 apiece. The tents are dotted with fairy lights, balloons and lanterns, and every child gets his or her own special space.\n\nCompleting the look is a fluffy, inviting white (white!) blanket placed in the center of the tents, where the young guests can gather to play games.\n\n\u201cThey were exactly what my daughter wanted,\u201d Ms. Sender said of her $600 investment for seven children.", "description": "The commodification of a homemade ritual.", "authors": ["Danielle Braff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/fashion/01SLUMBERPARTY4/01SLUMBERPARTY4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"}
