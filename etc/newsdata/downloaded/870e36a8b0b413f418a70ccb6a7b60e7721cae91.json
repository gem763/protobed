That the West would once again turn its back, after enlisting Kurdish help in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State, has been in the cards for years. Witness the West\u2019s unease with the ill-fated 2017 independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan or its silence about Turkey\u2019s 2018 Olive Branch military operation on Afrin in Syria.\n\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision this week to provide a de facto green light for yet another Turkish offensive into Kurdish-held territory in Northern Syria is not just another instance in a long, unfortunate pattern in Western-Kurdish relations. It\u2019s the turning of a new page in the history of the Middle East.\n\nThis is what the end of the Pax Americana in the region looks like. As bloody and tenuous as that pax may have been, its dissolution is disorienting for many in the region. For Europeans, in particular, it should serve as a shock that moves us to act.\n\nThe sudden power vacuum has Europe looking weak and unprepared. But the truth is that Europe has not led in the region for decades. As long as upheavals in the region unfolded under the shell of U.S. hegemony, Europeans operated in Uncle Sam\u2019s shadow. Sometimes European countries complemented American action, at other times they sought to moderate it. But they never opposed it or charted an autonomous path. If our weakness has been exposed, it\u2019s because we can no longer hide behind the U.S.\u2019s skirts.\n\nGiven Trump's position, there was probably little that could have been done to prevent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s offensive into northeastern Syria.\n\nThis moment was bound to come. Trump is an unusually erratic U.S. president, but on American engagement in the Middle East, he has been consistent for years. He has been looking for an opportunity to exit the Syrian quagmire since at least 2018. The Islamic State no longer represents a threat, at least not to the U.S., he argues. And if it remains a danger to the Kurds, the Middle East or Europe, well that\u2019s not his problem.\n\nGiven Trump's position, there was probably little that could have been done to prevent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s offensive into northeastern Syria. An embattled leader at home, with an ailing economy and plummeting domestic support, Erdo\u011fan turned to the familiar nationalist-populist playbook. What better way to galvanize popular support than a good old war \u2014 especially one that strikes nationalist chords and holds the prospect of pushing back into Syria some of the 3.6 million refugees currently in Turkey?\n\nErdo\u011fan gambled on Trump\u2019s isolationism and on Europe\u2019s cowardice. Tragically, his gamble appears to be paying off. And not just for Erdo\u011fan. As the U.S. retreats from the Middle East, Russia is gloating on the sidelines. Vladimir Putin has been characteristically tactical. The Russian president has not supported Erdo\u011fan\u2019s onslaught on northeastern Syria, but neither has he been vocal against it. He is probably eyeing the opportunity to eventually mediate a truce between Erdo\u011fan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, once the Syrian Kurds are forced to turn to Damascus for support.\n\nEurope has been accused of sitting silent as Turkey marches in. In truth, Europeans have spoken out. On behalf of the European Union, High Representative Federica Mogherini has called upon Turkey to cease its unilateral military action. But no one has any illusion that Europe\u2019s words can make a difference.\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s incursion \u2014 and Trump\u2019s acquiescence \u2014 makes clear Europe needs to learn to stand on its own. Europeans do not have the U.S. luxury of being able to walk away. They are bound to Turkey and to the Middle East for historical, geographical, societal and economic reasons. The question we need to ask ourselves is how can we regain influence in the region, and in particular with Turkey.\n\nThe place to start is at home. Erdo\u011fan must be made to understand that he can no longer blackmail us. We may not be able to prevent him from threatening to force millions of refugees across the Aegean, but we can establish a values-based system to manage migration and put in a place a refugee-sharing policy that will make us immune to his threats.\n\nThen we need to work to rebuild the leverage the EU has lost over the last 15 years \u2014 and there are plenty of reasons to believe that this will be possible. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s power is in decline. At the last local election, his Justice and Development Party (AKP) was dealt a humiliating defeat, with the loss of the country\u2019s economic powerhouses \u2014 most significantly Istanbul \u2014 to the opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the AKP is splintering in parliament, as former Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu and former Economy Minister Ali Babacan, with the backing of former President Abdullah G\u00fcl, are expected to launch their own parties by the end of the year.\n\nFurthermore, the Turkish economy has not recovered from last year\u2019s showdown between Erdo\u011fan and Trump, which exacerbated years of structural mismanagement and government meddling with interest rates and resulted in the Turkish lira\u2019s massive devaluation and skyrocketing inflation. Youth unemployment and the rising cost of living have been among the main reasons why the electorate is slowly but surely pivoting away from the AKP.\n\nThese calculations should strengthen the EU\u2019s hand as the next European Commission takes office. The EU has strong cards to play as it presses for democratic reforms and better behavior from Ankara. These include negotiations to upgrade its customs union with Turkey and launching a dialogue on visa-liberalization.\n\nMost of all, however, Europe must realize it must not blink. Turkey is not in a position to alienate its arguably most important partner. And the EU should be clear that it will not be blackmailed over the values that lie at its foundation.\n\nNathalie Tocci is director of Istituto Affari Internazionali and special adviser to European High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini.
