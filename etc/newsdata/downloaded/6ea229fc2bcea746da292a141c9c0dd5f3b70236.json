It is exactly what demonstrators in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square were saying 30 years ago, before many of today\u2019s protesters were born. The truth is that for all China\u2019s economic advances, it remains a brutal, dehumanizing tyranny in which the ruling Communist Party would rather destroy people than give them a genuine say in their government.\n\nI was in Beijing in 1989.
