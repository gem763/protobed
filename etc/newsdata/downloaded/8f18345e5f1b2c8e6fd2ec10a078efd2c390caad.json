McConnell\u2019s comment was from an interview conducted months earlier. The story has been corrected.\n\nReuters\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is on record as saying that if the House goes ahead and impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate \u201chas no choice\u201d but to conduct a trial to determine whether the president is removed from office.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican told NPR in an interview several months ago that \u201cif the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution anticipates that the upper chamber of Congress would open a trial once impeachment is referred from the House, but doubts have been expressed that under McConnell the Senate would follow through in that manner.\n\nIt has commonly been assumed that the GOP-held Senate would acquit Trump just as Democrats held together in 1999 to deny the GOP House from winning a conviction of President Bill Clinton.\n\nMcConnell is among the few senators remaining in the chamber who participated in the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial.", "description": "McConnell said that \u2018if the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF415_mcconn_ZG_20180313182941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
