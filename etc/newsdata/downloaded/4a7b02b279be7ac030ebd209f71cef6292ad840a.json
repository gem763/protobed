After some fun taste-testing, we agreed the standouts were the pop rock-filled chocolate truffles and sour-centered grape taffy.\n\nIt's is a great way to discover new treats and eat something other than the usual, same old candy during Halloween.\n\nMy favorite holiday, Halloween, is coming up soon. Of course, I like putting up spooky decorations, squeezing my friends' hands through horror movies, and marveling over everyone's creative costumes.\n\nMost of all, however, I'm in it for the candy. Halloween is one of the few times of the year when I can eat candy with reckless abandon and not feel guilty for it. Like everyone else, I have my favorites (namely Haribo and Trolli gummies, Twix, and good old-fashioned Hershey's milk chocolate bars), but even I get bored of them sometimes, and I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting candies to try.\n\nThis year, I got my Halloween wish in the form of the Universal Yums Halloween Box ($39). This box contains 300 pieces of candy from six different countries, plus a custom tray with six bowls to hold each type of candy and make it easy for trick-or-treaters or party guests to grab their pick.\n\nTaking a closer look inside the box\n\nUniversal Yums is a subscription box that sends you snacks and candies from a different country every month. These treats are usually very difficult or impossible to find in the US.\n\nThe Halloween Box, which is only available for a limited time, follows the same concept. The candies in this particular box hail from Italy, Thailand, Greece, Colombia, Ukraine, and Spain. Our team had never heard of any of the brands included, and we had a lot of fun taste-testing each one of the candies and debating our personal favorites.\n\nThese are the six types of candy included in the Halloween Box:\n\nOrange Toffee (Spain)\n\nPineapple Salt Candy (Thailand)\n\nMilky Splash Toffee (Ukraine)\n\nStrawberry Popping Chocolate (Italy)\n\nSour Grape Chewy Candy (Colombia)\n\nMilk Chocolate Wafers (Greece)\n\nThe Milky Splash Toffee was a too sweet and rich for my taste, but I liked the Milk Chocolate Wafers (somewhat like a Loacker wafer), and I loved the Strawberry Popping Chocolate and Sour Grape Chewy Candy. My colleagues also couldn't get enough of the pop rock-filled chocolate truffles, which were both fun and delicious to eat. The grape candy is chewy like taffy, with a Warheads-level sour center that jolts you awake with each bite.\n\nI usually try to restrain myself during the work day and eat relatively healthy, but I couldn't resist picking up a few candies from the assortment every time I passed by the desk they sat at. Although we're still working through the 300-piece pile, I'm already not looking forward to the day we run out.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFor someone like me with a major sweet tooth, the Halloween Box from Universal Yums is a great way to experience sweet (and sour) treats through a new and exciting lens. If you decide to share the haul with your trick-or-treaters or partygoers, they'll appreciate that they're not getting the same old candy they receive every year.", "description": "This seasonal, limited-edition Halloween candy box from Universal Yums contains 300 pieces of delicious candy from six different countries.", "authors": ["Connie Chen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d95fb828bd8ec1e98118406?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
