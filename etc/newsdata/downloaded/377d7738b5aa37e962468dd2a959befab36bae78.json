Here's why.", "language": "en", "text": "When I think of the Venture card from Capital One, I think of a lot more than the clever commercials with Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Garner. Over time, this card has gone from middle-of-the-road to a top-tier option for earning travel rewards.\n\nAfter adding new benefits and features over the last few years, the Venture card certainly ranks among my top five general travel rewards cards and is a perfect starting point for someone looking to earn and redeem flexible rewards, with some good benefits to boot. Here's a deeper look at what the Venture offers and why it's worth a fresh look, even if you didn't think it was the right fit in the past.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nImproved rewards earning (and burning)\n\nThis card starts you out with a 50,000-mile bonus after you spend $3,000 in the first three months. You'll earn a flat 2 miles per dollar on every purchase and 10x miles at Hotels.com/venture until January 2020. That makes it easy to earn miles quickly without worrying about which card to use where.\n\nRead more: The best credit card sign-up bonuses available now\n\nThe easiest way to redeem, and a perfect starting place for people new to travel miles and points rewards, is the Capital One Purchase Eraser feature. This gives you 1 cent per mile to erase any past travel purchase. You can also book travel through the Venture portal to get the same value when booking new travel.\n\nCapital One also offers the ability to transfer miles to partner airlines. There is a list of 15 partners. While JetBlue is the closest option to a major US carrier, some are partners with big US airlines and allow you to book partner awards in the US. Of course, they are also great for flying to their home countries and regions in many cases.\n\nIt's trickier to know exactly how much value you'll get when transferring unless you do the math on each award redemption as you go. Venture miles transfer at a 2:1.5 ratio or 2:1 ratio depending on which partner you choose.\n\nIf you redeem for premium business or first-class bookings, you'll probably get a whole lot more in value than the 1 cent per mile offered by the Purchase Eraser. But in some cases, you could end up with less than 1 cent per Venture mile, so you should always compare and run the numbers to make sure you get at least 1 cent.\n\nRead more: Chase Sapphire Preferred vs. Capital One Venture \u2014 credit card comparison\n\nImproved Venture card benefits\n\nThe card has all the benefits you'd expect in exchange for a $95 annual fee. These include no foreign transaction fees, travel accident insurance, and rental car collision damage coverage.\n\nFor purchases, new cardholders get purchase protection and an automatic extended warranty through their Visa Signature benefits. I'm going through the process of an extended warranty claim right now, and I'm so glad I have this benefit.\n\nAnd don't forget about that TSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit of up to $100. Global Entry is definitely the best option if you have this credit. If that's the route you go, it's worth $20 per year. Don't leave that offer on the table.\n\nRead more: Capital One Venture card review\n\nMy verdict\n\nThanks to the benefits Capital One's added over the last year, the Venture card has risen into my top-five list for the best travel rewards credit cards. For a card with an annual fee of just $95 (waived the first year), it's excellent for its 2x earning rate and easy Purchase Eraser redemptions. And the benefits are not too shabby, either.\n\nA couple of years ago, Venture was an okay card that didn't get me all that excited. But these days, it's worth a serious look. It isn't my personal number-one card, but it is a great choice for a lot of people and one I would certainly recommend considering.", "description": "The Venture card used to be pretty run of the mill, but it's become one of my top travel rewards card recommendations thanks to new benefits.", "authors": ["Eric Rosenberg"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bb6782e22af40d123aa8d-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
