But in recent years the company has developed into a smaller NGS player, where a wider range or all genes are sequenced.\n\nAs part of a 15-year collaboration deal with NGS pioneer Illumina (ILMN.O), Qiagen will rely on its genetic diagnostic products running on its new partner\u2019s hardware.\n\nSchatz, who will become a special adviser to the supervisory board, had been with the company for 27 years. Since he started as finance chief in 1993, Qiagen has grown from $2 million in annual revenues to $1.5 billion in 2018.", "description": "Qiagen's longtime CEO Peer Schatz resigned after the German genetic testing company disclosed a reversal of its genome sequencing strategy and a slump in its Chinese business, sending its shares tumbling 20%.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438402574&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970NH", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
