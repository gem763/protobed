The mammal, thought to be about 20ft, was seen on Monday near the Dartford crossing. The sightings, which sparked a warning for ships to slow down, come a year after a Beluga (dubbed \u201cBenny\u201d \u2013 alliteration appears to be very important when naming whales) spent three months in the same part of the river.\n\nWhile it is novel for a humpback to be spotted in the Thames, they are becoming more frequent visitors to Britain. \u201cHumpbacks have been visiting UK waters more and more since 2004, and there is evidence that some of them may be returning individuals,\u201d explains the Natural History Museum website. \u201cThey pass each year as part of their migration between feeding grounds in the North Atlantic and breeding grounds in the Caribbean and the Azores. Experts think the rise in UK sightings could be linked to a general increase in their population sizes, which have been recovering globally since last century\u2019s commercial whaling bans.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/humpback-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-02-25"}
