REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n(Reuters) - Republican senator Marco Rubio said on Monday he plans to introduce legislation to block U.S. government pension funds from investing in Chinese stocks after a fund delayed a decision about tracking an index provided by MSCI Inc (MSCI.N).\n\nRubio and a bipartisan group of senators have complained about specific companies included in the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index, which gives a 7.5% weighting to Chinese firms.\n\nThe U.S. lawmakers say the targeted companies \u201cassist in the Chinese government\u2019s military activities, espionage, and human rights abuses, as well as many other Chinese companies that lack basic financial transparency.\u201d\n\nThey had called on the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to reverse its decision to begin tracking the index for the Thrift Savings Plan\u2019s (TSP) International Stock Fund.\n\nRubio\u2019s office said in an emailed statement that the FTRIB had delayed its decision at a meeting on Monday, to reconsider the issue at a Nov. 13 meeting.\n\n\u201cIts clear the Board will not act in the best interests of the United States, reverse this misguided decision and protect our national interest, as well as those who serve it,\u201d Rubio said in the statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I will be introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure that federal retirement savings can never be a source of wealth funding the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of our nation\u2019s future prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe TSP is a retirement savings plan for federal employees and members of the military. As of July 2019, TSP assets totaled around $599.5 billion.\n\nMSCI is one of the world\u2019s largest index providers, with trillions of dollars tracking its benchmarks. It previously responded to Rubio\u2019s criticisms, saying there was no U.S. law prohibiting an index company from creating an index containing Chinese securities.\n\nA FRTIB spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment, outside regular U.S. business hours.", "description": "Republican senator Marco Rubio said on Monday he plans to introduce legislation to block U.S. government pension funds from investing in Chinese stocks after a fund delayed a decision about tracking an index provided by MSCI Inc .", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446065668&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S085", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
