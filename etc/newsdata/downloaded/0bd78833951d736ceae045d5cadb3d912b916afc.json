And there is no room in the workplace for those who ascribe to such a thing. I have communicated with USIA Glawe, who is currently in Israel, and he is disgusted by what has happened.\u201d\n\nMurphy then details a number of steps he said the department is taking, including removing the swastika, asking staffers and cleaning personnel if they saw anything \u201csuspicious,\u201d notifying the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s offices of the inspector general and security, asking the DHS Insider Threat Program \u201cto take steps as appropriate\u201d and hearing suggestions \u201con steps we may want to take\u201d from the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Dhs-Swastika-Investigation"], "top_image": ""}
