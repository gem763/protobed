Protesters say that Lam\u2019s withdrawal is too little too late, and that their additional demands have not been met.\n\n\u201cIf it happened two months earlier, I\u2019m sure we would have seem much less bloodshed,\u201d Bonnie Leung, the Vice Convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, told Insider.

Hong Kong has its own government, police force, and criminal justice system, but is ultimately overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, which appointed Lam.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong protesters are calling for massive ATM withdrawals in an economic warning to China\n\nWhile the decision to scrap the bill is a step in the right direction, protesters say, it\u2019s not enough. \u2018The withdrawal of the bill is too little, too late, because it is obviously overdue. If it happened two months earlier, I\u2019m sure we would have seen much less bloodshed,\u201d Bonnie Leung, the Vice Convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, told Insider.\n\nOne demand down, four to go.\n\nProtests that started out as an outcry against the bill have morphed into larger pro-democracy protests, which include five demands:\n\nWithdraw the extradition bill.\n\nThe government should retract its characterization of protesters as \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nLaunch an independent inquiry into police brutality.\n\nRelease protesters who have been imprisoned.\n\nDemocratic elections for Hong Kong.\n\nProtesters have also called for Lam\u2019s resignation. While she said in audio leaked to Reuters that she would quit if she had the option, she clarified to the BBC that she hadn\u2019t tendered her resignation to Beijing but didn\u2019t deny the authenticity of the recording.\n\n\u201cNow, one demand has been accepted, has been responded, so we may celebrate a bit, just seconds. Of course, we have waited for it for a very, very long time,\u201d Leung said.\n\nDemosisto, a leading pro-democracy protest group in Hong Kong, also tweeted that the withdrawal of the bill is not enough, saying that the protests have changed Hong Kong irreversibly. \u201cDemocracy, right here and right now, is the only way out.\u201d\n\nCarrie\u2019s response comes too late and too little, failing to address our 5 demands. Protests of the past three months have left irreversible scar on #HongKong, especially the esculating #PoliceBrutality. #Democracy, right here and right now, is the only way out.

While withdrawal is arguably the simplest of the protesters\u2019 demands for the government to meet, officials in Beijing were loath to do so and indicate that the legislation was a mistake in the first place, The New York Times reports.\n\nThe extradition bill is set to begin the withdrawal process in October, when Hong Kong\u2019s legislature will meet.\n\ncaption Police clash with anti-extradition bill protesters after a protest, at Tsuen Wan, in Hong Kong, China August 25, 2019. source Tyrone Siu / REUTERS\n\n\u2018We see police officers themselves breaking the law with no consequences at all.\u2019\n\nBut while one demand has been met, concerns about policy brutality are top of mind for protesters in light of increasingly violent protests in the city.\n\n\u201cWe see police officers quite blatantly violate their own rules, using totally disproportionate force [and] violence against not only protesters, but even pedestrians, passengers in the MTL train being beaten up indiscriminately,\u201d Leung said. \u201cSo we see police officers themselves breaking the law with no consequences at all.\u201d\n\nLam has instructed Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) to look into violence against protesters. But protesters see the IPCC as loyal to Lam; it\u2019s headed by Lam appointee Anthony Francis Neoh, the territory\u2019s former Securities and Futures Commission chair.\n\nLam also said during a televised address on Wednesday that she hopes to start dialogue with Hongkongers, saying she wishes to \u201cexamine and review society\u2019s deep-seated problems and to advise the government on finding solutions,\u201d according to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cToo little and too late now \u2013 Carrie Lam\u2019s response comes after 7 lives sacrificed, more than 1,200 protestors arrested, in which many are mistreated in police station,\u201d protest leader Joshua Wong tweeted Wednesday, referencing a spate of suicides attributed Beijing\u2019s inflexibility and adding that protesters are unlikely to see Lam\u2019s move as sincere.\n\n\u201cWhenever there are signs of sending a palm branch, they always come with a far tighter grip on exercising civil rights,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that more brutal crackdowns are to come.", "description": "Business Insider - Protest leader Bonnie Leung told Insider Lam's move is too late. \"If it happened two months earlier, I'm sure we would have seen much less bloodshed.\".
