REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nThe BOJ bought 163 billion yen (1.22 billion pounds) worth of Japanese stock ETFs in September, central bank data showed on Monday.\n\nIt was the smallest monthly buying after the central bank doubled the buying target to 6 trillion yen per year in July 2016. So far this year, the BOJ has bought 3.6 trillion yen in ETFs, about 20% less than same period last year.\n\nBOJs ETF buying hits the lowest in 3 years: here\n\nThe pace of BOJs ETF buying slowing in 2019: here\n\nNevertheless, market players see few immediate policy implications.\n\nThe BOJ's buying fell in September as the BOJ has been sticking to its unwritten, self-imposed rule that it buys ETFs on a day when the Topix index .TOPX falls 0.5% or more in the morning.\n\nIn September, the BOJ bought only a little, just because Japanese shares have rallied strongly, with the Topix comfortably outperforming global peers.\n\nTopix climbed 5.0%, compared with 1.2% gain in the U.S. S&P500 .SPX and 3.2% rise in Europe's STOXX600 .\n\nYet, analysts say the outperformance of Japanese shares was largely due to short-covering by foreign speculators while long-only investors have mostly stayed away, suggesting the market remains vulnerable.\n\nForeign flows into Japanese stocks: here\n\nOne key worry for overseas investors is a hit to the Japanese economy from an imminent consumption tax hike, scheduled on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt will take time before long-only foreign investors start buying Japanese shares as \u2018global cyclical stocks\u2019,\u201d said Masatoshi Kikuchi, chief equity strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\n\u201cWe think they will wait and see how the domestic economy fares after the sales tax hike and whether mid-year earnings reporting season shows a profit turnaround.\u201d\n\nFor the past year or so, Japan Inc\u2019s earnings outlook has been constantly deteriorating.\n\nJapan corporate earnings: here\n\nThere is likely to be a bumpy road ahead, said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, citing many uncertain factors such as U.S.-China trade talks and U.S. congressional moves to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the BOJ is glad to have a plenty of room left to buy ETFs for the Oct-Dec period. The central bank could still end up using the remaining allowance by the year end.\u201d", "description": "The Bank of Japan's exchange-traded funds purchase this month hit the lowest level in more than three years, but few market players see it as a sign the central bank is tapering its stock buying.", "authors": ["Tomo Uetake", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435683505&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1KP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
