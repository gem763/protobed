The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its interest rate to a record low and said it may ease further.\n\nAlthough a measure of Chinese manufacturing improved, the overall tone was of the world economy failing to rebound from the slowdown that has plagued it for the whole of this year amid mounting trade tensions. That leaves the U.S. and China under pressure to resolve their differences as well central bankers and governments to find ways to support demand.\n\n\u201cThere can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptions,\u201d Fitch Chief Economist Brian Coulton said.\n\nThe WTO cut its 2019 trade growth forecast by more than half to 1.2%, and warned that further rounds of tariffs could spark a \u201cdestructive cycle of recrimination.\u201d\n\nUBS Group AG economists reckon global expansion is tracking just 2.3% at the moment, almost a percentage point less than the start of the third quarter. Those at Danske Bank are warning there is a 30% chance of a global recession in the next two years.\n\nWhile global trade tensions are part of the story, there\u2019s also industry specific issues -- autos in Germany, semiconductors in South Korea -- adding to the hurdles.\n\nGerman car-parts giant Continental AG (DE: ) last month laid out a sweeping restructuring plan that could affect as many as 20,000 jobs worldwide. Japan\u2019s Kawasaki Heavy Industries cut its forecasts, citing sales to chipmakers.\n\nCentral banks around the world are fighting the slowdown with rate cuts and monetary stimulus. But they are also ramping up calls on governments to jump in too with fiscal measures, saying they can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting.\n\nIn the meantime, global bond investors are betting against a meaningful inflation pickup. Even with sovereign yields below zero, they are still piling into government debt, and so-called deflation trades are on the rise. Germany\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs are at minus 0.5%.\n\nSuch an environment is worrying for central bankers with inflation already low and well short of targets. Consumer-price growth in Germany and the euro area slipped below 1% in September for the first time since 2016. For the latter, that\u2019s far short of the European Central Bank\u2019s goal.\n\nIn the U.K., the PMI reading improved, but still remained below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.\n\nChina\u2019s numbers were mixed. The Caixin/IHS Markit measure to 51.4 in September from 50.4 in August. The nation\u2019s official PMI was less upbeat -- edging up to 49.8 from 49.5.\n\nParts of the global economy still show resilience. Services are growing, and falling unemployment is supporting consumer spending. U.S.-China trade negotiations remain a critical risk for the outlook, with a Chinese delegation set to visit Washington for further talks this month aimed at hammering out a deal.\n\n\u201cWe would hear a great sigh of relief form central banks around the world if the trade situation were to be somewhat resolved,\u201d Holger Schmieding, Berenberg Bank chief economist, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cI\u2019d be positively surprised if we had a lasting resolution within the next few months. Both sides want a deal, but they still seem far apart.\u201d", "description": "World Economy Sends Up New Flares Amid Growing Industrial Crisis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic098cbaad0492a8b0b7bb4affa52f9701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
