'That event, in fact, caused AT&T to redesign its power system for transatlantic cables,' NASA wrote in the account. One of the flares was a 'two-ribbon' flare, dubbed the 'seahorse flare' in which the flaring region appear as two bright lines threading through the area between sunspots within a sunspot group.\n\n\n\nResearchers say the solar storm activated magnetic sensors in the undersea destructor mines, causing them to blow up en masse.\n\nThe underwater explosives were rigged to detonate in response to magnetic, acoustic, and pressure signatures from passing ships.\n\nHowever, on August 4, 1972, crew members aboard U.S. Task Force 77 aircraft suddenly observed explosions south of Hai Phong.\n\n20 to 30 explosions were documented in just 30 seconds.\n\nAnother 25 to 30 patches of muddy water were also observed, indicative of further explosions.\n\n'The extreme space weather events of early August 1972 had significant impact on the US Navy, which have not been widely reported,' researchers led by Delores Knipp, a space weather expert at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said in their paper.\n\n'These effects, long buried in the Vietnam War archives, add credence to the severity of the storm: a nearly instantaneous, unintended detonation of dozens of sea mines south of Hai Phong, North Vietnam on 4 August 1972.'\n\nThe largest solar storm ever recorded, The Carrington Event in 1859, took out telegraph machines across the US, purportedly causing sparks to fly from equipment \u2013 some bad enough to set fires inside offices.\n\nWHAT WAS OPERATION POCKET MONEY? Operation Pocket Money was timed to coincide with a televised speech by President Richard Nixon at 21:00 8 May ET. President Richard Nixon signed off on Operation Pocket Money, a plan to deploy 11,000 sea mines off the coast of North Vietnam to cut off naval supply routes to the region. These underwater explosives were rigged to detonate in response to magnetic, acoustic, and pressure signatures from passing ships. The operation was timed to coincide with a televised speech by President Richard Nixon at 21:00 8 May ET. But on August 4 of that year, a mysterious force triggered a mass explosion of dozens of mines. Crew members aboard U.S. Task Force 77 aircraft suddenly observed explosions south of Hai Phong. 20 to 30 explosions were documented in just 30 seconds. Another 25 to 30 patches of muddy water were also observed, indicative of further explosions. Additional mining missions began on 11 May. By the end of the year Navy and Marine Corps bombers had dropped more than eight thousand mines in North Vietnamese coastal waters and three thousand in inland waterways\n\nThe team concluded that the 1972 event could have been in the same league as the Carrington Event.\n\n'The activity fits the description of a Carrington\u2010class storm minus the low latitude aurora reported in 1859,' they wrote.\n\nU.S. Marine helicopters leave troops into suspected Viet Cong area during a full fledged assault operation by U.S. Marines near Da Nang, South Vietnam, in this April 29, 1965 black-and-white file photo during the Vietnam War. Researchers now say a solar storm may have impacted the US Navy during a mining operation\n\n'In our view this storm deserves a scientific revisit as a grand challenge for the space weather community, as it provides space\u2010age terrestrial observations of what was likely a Carrington\u2010class storm,' the authors said.\n\nNASA describes the storm as 'legendary' because it occurred in between two Apollo missions: the crew of Apollo 16 had returned to Earth in April and the crew of Apollo 17 was preparing for a moon landing in December.\n\nA new Boulder study claims Operation Pocket Money, a plan to deploy 11,000 sea mines off the coast of North Vietnam to cut off naval supply routes to the region, was scuppered by the storm.
