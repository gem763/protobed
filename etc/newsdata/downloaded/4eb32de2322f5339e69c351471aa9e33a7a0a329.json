Shouting, catcalling and insults spewed out of the live coverage from the House of Commons. He shrugged; even his customers during the rush hour never behave like that.\n\nLanguage and tone has never been more important as we inch towards a momentous decision for our country, but, just like Brexit, is it possible to rein back? To take a collective deep breath and think before we comment?\n\nIn the US, and now in the UK, leaders use language as a weapon \u2013 a highly tuned device to make the maximum impact. One premier might have been schooled in the classics and the other has primary-school level literacy, but both instinctively know how to achieve maximum impact, generally at the elevated level of hyperbole. In Trump\u2019s lexicon, even the word \u201cnice\u201d, as applied to eco-activist Greta Thunberg, can be an insult.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen even the prime minister\u2019s sister indicates she finds his combative tone unhelpful, when MPs leave the House to face verbal abuse from bystanders on their way to the underground, when they have to instal panic buttons and anti-explosive bags for their mail, things have gone way too far.\n\nThe public is exhausted by the in-fighting at Westminster. People just want to move on and discuss health, education, and the lack of funding for social care \u2013 but with deadlock in the Commons, how to find a way to compromise, when the PM seems to equate the word with castration of his giant ego?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Munchetty said: \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve been told as a woman of colour to \u2018go back to where I\u2019ve come from\u2019 that was embedded in racism\u201d. When asked by her co-host Dan Walker how she felt about Trump\u2019s remarks, she replied: \u201cAbsolutely furious.\u201d\n\nThere has been widespread outrage at the BBC\u2019s decision to reprimand Munchetty for breaching the guidelines on impartiality, following a single complaint. David Jordan, the BBC\u2019s director of editorial policy and standards, tried to clarify the reasoning on the Today programme, saying it was not wrong to describe the president\u2019s tweets as racist, but Munchetty \u201ccrossed the line\u201d relating to impartiality guidelines when she went on to discuss Trump himself and what his motivation for making these remarks might be, and in expressing her fury at hearing them when asked by Walker.\n\nBBC guidelines categorically state the audience should not be able to tell the personal opinions of journalists and presenters on \u201ca matter of public policy or political controversy\u201d. He added that \u201cit\u2019s not about calling out the racist comments \u2026 (that\u2019s) perfectly acceptable when things are framed in racist language ... It\u2019s about how you go on to discuss the person who made them and make assumptions\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a fine line, but was the decision worth making?\n\nUnfortunately Naga was encouraged to express her opinions; would she have made them public otherwise?\n\nNight after night, Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler report on the latest Brexit shenanigans and as they do so they are forced to walk on eggshells. There might be speculation on social media about their personal political leanings, but they do a commendable job in very difficult circumstances.\n\nAccording to Jordan, his decision has been widely misrepresented, \u201cperhaps wilfully misinterpreted in some respects\u201d.\n\nHe has tried to maintain a strict line in a climate of name-calling and disrespect on all sides. Of course Trump\u2019s remarks were revolting, but did it add anything to know what Naga personally thinks, because any viewer with two brain cells could work that out for themselves?\n\nI co-present an ITV programme, Loose Women, in which four of us discuss the issues of the day and these tweets by Trump got a full condemnation. But the difference is not the colour of my skin but the fact that we are paid to comment, not impartially present the news.\n\nOf course, what constitutes news in the new downmarket BBC is debatable, (the broadcaster that pays Towie\u2019s Gemma Collins for her often crass opinions on a podcast), but news still has to be presented in a neutral way by our national broadcaster.\n\nJournalist Afua Hirsch organised an open letter of complaint to the BBC, and says she was \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d by the decision to \u201ccensure\u201d the newsreader. According to Hirsch, the ruling \u201csuggests that racist views should be treated impartially\u201d and it will have \u201ca chilling effect on people of colour who work in broadcasting\u201d.\n\nI beg to differ. Racism is repugnant and illegal. So is sexual discrimination and gender-targeted violence. If newscasters and presenters were allowed to comment based on their own sexuality or ethnic background, then news would just become even more indistinguishable from light entertainment. That\u2019s not to demean the issues involved, but news is news. Frankly, would Dan Walker have asked the question \u201chow do you feel?\u201d of a co-host if their skin was white? Can white people not be as revolted as people of colour? Either way, these reflections are not for a news bulletin.\n\nIt\u2019s too easy to bash the BBC. We should be asking instead why John Bercow did not exercise more muscle and shut down debate in the House of Commons? Maybe a three-day recess would have been a good idea; the time could have been used to instal a bleeping buzzer or off switch on the parliamentary sound system.", "description": "The guy serving coffee at my station turned from the television as he handed over the cup, shaking his head. \u201cWhat do they sound like?\u201d he asked.
