At first, Molton busked outdoors, the street her stage. Even after she was discovered by the District\u2019s folk community in the 1960s and began performing at such places as the Library of Congress and Smithsonian Folklife Festival, Molton would often sit with her guitar amid the bustle of downtown and sing about salvation.\n\nMolton was a public artist. And that\u2019s what the 56-year-old Bergen is. You\u2019ve probably seen stuff created in his Brentwood, Md., studio. Walked on it, even. He made the animalistic Chinese zodiac crosswalk at Seventh and H streets NW in Chinatown. His red die-cut sign at First and F streets SE shows two dinosaurs in a chase: a Capitalsaurus on the heels of a Falcarius.\n\nAD\n\nBergen has transformed other call boxes, too, including six on Rhode Island Avenue NW. One celebrates Bo Diddley, who lived and recorded in a house in the neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nCall boxes \u2014 in use from the 1890s to the 1970s \u2014 have become signature settings for Washington\u2019s public art. The artworks inside may not be as grand as a marble Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King Jr., but they reward the attentive pedestrian.\n\n\u201cThe ones that face east are best looked at early in the morning,\u201d Bergen said.\n\nNext to Molton\u2019s bas-relief is a call box celebrating Alma Thomas (1891-1978), the Washington Color School artist. The base of the box is stenciled with highlights of Thomas\u2019s life. A small plaque affixed to the box provides a more detailed biography. Each call box is a mini history lesson.\n\nAD\n\nBergen is a local, a graduate of St. Albans who went to Yale University for undergrad then returned to Yale to become an architect. He made a specialty out of overseeing construction projects.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConstruction administration is so stressful that I needed something to do on the weekends that I had control over,\u201d he said. That was making art. One of Bergen\u2019s earliest large-scale creations was a 12-foot-long lobster he fashioned out of copper and a severed branch from his parent\u2019s yard.\n\nBergen continued to juggle architecture and art until the fall of 2013, when one of his designs was shortlisted for the Chuck Brown Memorial Park. He didn\u2019t win that commission, but he realized that if he did, he couldn\u2019t really be a part-time architect and a part-time sculptor. The art won out, and he quit his day job.\n\nAD\n\nWe walked in a ragged clockwise circle, passing call boxes honoring civil rights activist Mary Church Terrell, poet and composer Julia Ward Howe, suffragist Alice Paul, Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and D.C. home rights activist Josephine Butler.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere were lots of strong women in my life,\u201d Bergen said. His mother taught history at the Washington Ballet, back when the dance company had its own school for young dancers, then at the Madeira School. An aunt started the Victorian Society in England. His wife, Sujatha, is the health campaigns director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe $175,000 call box project was commissioned by the Downtown BID. Artists who assisted Bergen include Darian Lassiter, Nathan Cousins, Mathew Andrews, Tsahai Pettiford, Amber Logan, Hakeem Olayinka, Aaron Rogers, Brandon Bailey, Elsabe Dixon and George Tkabladze. Art students with the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program were also involved.\n\nAD\n\nWe stopped at Vermont and K NW, next to the call box sculpture of Elizabeth Keckley, an African American seamstress and confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a great location,\u201d Bergen said, meaning the call box is surrounded by plenty of sidewalk. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get hit by a car while you step back to look at it.\u201d\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "Charles Bergen filled the cast-iron relics with sculptures of activists and artists.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vrRqIEHcbNEn7sqx2St_ETaSqjE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QZYLCAX2MAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
