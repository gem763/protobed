The House voted for an impeachment inquiry,' and then try to pull in everything they've already done under that nomenclature,\" he said.\n\nBut, such a move will not go unnoticed by many Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"That won't get past us,\" he added.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Pelosi announced after meeting with the House Democratic caucus there will be no vote -- at least for now -- on the launch of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\n\"There's no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\" Pelosi said. \"We're not here to call bluffs -- we're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "If House Democrats are not ready to hold a full vote on the Trump impeachment inquiry,\u00a0it proves any future vote will be a \"sham,\" according to radio host\u00a0Mark Levin.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz", "Mark Levin"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Mark-Levin1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
