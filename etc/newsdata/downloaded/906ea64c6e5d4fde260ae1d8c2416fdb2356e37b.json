What's more, Samsung is said to be rolling out a slew of changes to improve on the design, as well as lowering the price tag.\n\nAccording to mysterious industry sources, the Korean tech giant's follow up to the Fold may sport a smaller screen overall and feature a horizontal seam for vertical folding, akin to a clamshell design. The display could measure just 6.7 inches, with a focus on portability rather than a generous screen size.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung could well be ditching the plastic polymide (PI) protective layer on the screen for scratch-resistant ultra-thin glass (UTG), presumably as a measure to stop people trying to peel the bloody thing off and buggering up their phones.\n\nUTG could end up bumping up production costs, so it's possible that the Galaxy Fold 2 will be available in models offering smaller storage options to balance the price.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold was announced back in February, and was initially slated for a May 3 launch in Europe - but that was before the many, many issues with the smartphone popped up, that took Samsung an age to iron out.\n\nAs it stands, the phone has a hefty price tag, but that hasn't stopped its smaller production runs from selling out, and getting sold on by resellers for an even higher price.\n\nEven though the main problems with the foldable were fixed, another design flaw looks to have been discovered recently, so it really seems that early adopters are simply going to get shafted for their troubles.
