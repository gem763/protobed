White House Counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week slamming the impeachment inquiry as illegitimate and invalid effectively shut down any possibility of cooperation.\n\nThe House lawyers emphasized why they consider McGahn \u2014 more than any other witness \u2014 the most important to determine whether Trump should be impeached on the basis of obstructing the Mueller investigation.\n\nMcGahn, they argued, could speak to Trump\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, state of mind, and knowledge of wrongdoing during their interactions.\u201d He was a witness to numerous allegations of potential obstruction, from Trump\u2019s direct requests to remove Mueller to his efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to constrain the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cMcGahn\u2019s testimony on these topics will help the committee determine all of the relevant facts, present a full picture of what happened, and decide whether to recommend articles of impeachment,\u201d the lawyers added.\n\nMcGahn\u2019s testimony is even more urgent, they said, because Trump has repeatedly tried to discredit him, claiming that he lied to Mueller\u2019s team about the episodes he witnessed.\n\nThe White House\u2019s efforts to undercut House Democrats\u2019 investigations intensified last month when Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry centered on Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian president. Since then, the Trump administration has sought to block current and former senior officials and diplomats from testifying \u2014 though some have appeared for depositions regardless of those directives.\n\nBut executive branch agencies are still refusing to comply with subpoenas for documents. This week alone, the Pentagon, the White House budget office and the vice president\u2019s office all rejected subpoenas or requests for documents related to Ukraine.", "description": "Lawyers for the House of Representatives on Wednesday accused President Donald Trump of trying to \u201cobstruct his own impeachment\u201d by claiming the authority to block his advisers from cooperating with congressional investigations.
