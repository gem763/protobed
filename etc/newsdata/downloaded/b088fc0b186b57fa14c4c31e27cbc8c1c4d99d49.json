Meanwhile, suffering Appalachian coal miners afflicted by black lung disease have been lobbying Congress this week, as coal jobs and benefits ebb away.\n\nMurray, CEO of Murray Energy, will host Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, on Wednesday at a private fundraising committee reception. Attendees of the fundraiser include West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R), among other lawmakers. In a June letter from Murray requesting Justice\u2019s attendance, the coal executive emphasized re-electing Trump.\n\n\u201cThe future of the coal industry and our family livelihoods depend on President Trump being re-elected,\u201d Murray wrote. He also advised donations of at least $150 per attendee to the Trump Victory fundraising committee.\n\nThe coal magnate is a long-time supporter of the president and has maintained ties with the administration. He has pushed for the rollback of environmental regulations through a \u201cwish list\u201d given to the administration, in addition to backing a bailout for struggling coal and nuclear plants. Trump in turn has repeatedly lauded \u201cbeautiful clean coal\u201d as a key U.S. product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut coal\u2019s grim trajectory is increasingly at odds with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, even as he has repeatedly sought to rescue the industry. Market forces \u2014 namely, the dramatic rise of renewables and natural gas \u2014 have helped to push coal into a downward spiral, one confirmed by the government\u2019s own figures.\n\nAnd the list of of coal companies declaring bankruptcy keeps growing. Eight major U.S. coal producers have filed for bankruptcy since November 2017, five of them this year. This includes Cloud Peak Energy, Blackjewel, and Cambrian. Last week, Blackhawk Mining became the latest to file for bankruptcy. While Blackhawk has said this will not affect its 2,800 employees, the company\u2019s financial struggles are widely reflected across the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, coal workers are increasingly caught in the crossfire. Some companies have sought to void union contracts and walk away from pension obligations, moves that have seen success in court despite outcry from groups like United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).\n\nMany retired miners in particular are sick and unable to work after years of physical labor compounded by a condition known as coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, or black lung. That disease is caused by long-term exposure to coal dust and results in respiratory issues and declining lung function. There is currently no cure for black lung.\n\nTrump\u2019s travels to coal country coincide with a trip by a large group of Appalachian miners to Washington, D.C., this week. Many have come to request that Congress bolster the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which has faced growing debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat fund provides for miners when companies cannot, including when the corporations go bankrupt. A steadily-increasing tax on coal supported the fund but its higher rate expired last year and the trust fund\u2019s debt is projected to be around $15 billion by 2050. Coal companies have meanwhile lobbied against raising the tax, as doing so impacts them financially.\n\n\u201cCoal miners deserve better. They always have. I certainly hope that lawmakers will be listening this week,\u201d wrote Tyler Hughes, a field director with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices, in a post this week foreshadowing the D.C. trip.\n\nSome lawmakers have sought to support the fund, including Reps. Bobby Scott (D-VA) and Alma Adams (D-NC), while Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) has introduced a bill to help miners access the fund\u2019s benefits. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will be critical for efforts to raise the tax and miners, as he has the power to push legislation forward in the Senate.\n\nMiners who met with the senator on Tuesday said they left the interaction disappointed. Many affected by black lung came attached to oxygen tanks in order to meet with McConnell, but they said he gave them only a few minutes of his time and made no guarantees about the disability fund.\n\nTheir efforts have added to an argument made by environmental activists, that lawmakers should focus on protecting impacted communities as the country transitions away from fossil fuels. The Green New Deal framework emphasizes prioritizing frontline communities like coal miners through a \u201cjust transition,\u201d all while working to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. economy to reach net-zero emissions. Unions have been split on the Green New Deal, citing concerns over jobs.\n\nBut while miners desperately lobby lawmakers like McConnell for help, they worry time is running out \u2014 as coal companies continue moving towards bankruptcy, all workers, with or without black lung, will be impacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd right now, all eyes are on Murray Energy, the only one of the original companies to still be paying dues into a miners\u2019 pension plan established in 1974. That plan is set to collapse by 2022 unless stabilized by lawmakers. But if Murray Energy were to go under, that deadline could come sooner.\n\nIt is unclear what role Trump might play in pushing to keep the company afloat should its financial situation decline to the point of bankruptcy. Historically, the president has taken to Twitter in an effort to show support for keeping coal plants alive.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies have also doubled down on propping up coal companies. On Tuesday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed legislation bailing out coal and nuclear plants, a measure supported by Trump. DeWine will be among the attendees at Wednesday\u2019s Murray fundraiser.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-152716013.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
