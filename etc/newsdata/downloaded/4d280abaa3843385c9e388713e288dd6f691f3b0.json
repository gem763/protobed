In a message to employees about the layoffs on Tuesday that was viewed by The New York Times, Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the company had gone off course as it grew and must streamline to regain its competitive edge.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we grew our teams rapidly and in a decentralized way. This made sense as we worked to scale the business globally and find product-market fit,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which echoed what he said in July with the previous layoffs. \u201cBut at a certain point, bigger teams do not mean better results. It\u2019s critical we get our edge back and continually push ourselves to do better.\u201d\n\nUber has been under pressure this year over its long-term viability. The company had a troubled initial public offering in May as investors questioned its ride-hailing business, which is expensive to operate. Uber\u2019s stock slid below its offering price on its first day of trading and continues to struggle. In August, it reported a record quarterly loss of $5.2 billion and its slowest-ever revenue growth. Uber\u2019s shares rose about 4 percent on Tuesday.", "description": "The ride-hailing company laid off 435 workers on Tuesday, following a round of layoffs in July.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "Mike Isaac"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/business/10UBER/10UBER-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
