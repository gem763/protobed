That faith proved misplaced a day later as the stock crashed almost 32% after an unfavorable ruling in the company\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe whipsaw illustrates both the allure of utility stocks and the danger of blindly investing in them as a class. With big, stable revenues and limited exposure to international trade, the companies represent an investment tailor-made for the current moment. And yet while customers are unlikely to stop buying their products no matter the state of the economy, individual firms still face their own, specific risks.\n\n\u201cYou may cut back on your electricity use during a recession, but you\u2019re still going to use electricity,\u201d said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s not a discretionary item.\u201d But \u201cutilities can fall dramatically in value, individually,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s utilities index has risen 21% this year, setting records along the way. Individual utility owners such as Southern Co. and Dominion Energy Inc. are also trading at record highs.\n\nTimothy Winter, who helps manage over $30 billion at Gabelli Funds LLC as an associate portfolio manager, says the rise in utility stocks has been driven by the industry\u2019s ability to increase earnings on a sustainable basis amid massive infrastructure investments. About 10% of funds managed by Gabelli are invested in utilities, and Winter says a new fund is being planned for investments in green energy alternatives.\n\nStrong Fundamentals\n\n\u201cFundamentals are stronger than they have ever been -- that is because earnings and dividends are growing stronger than they have ever grown before on a sustainable basis,\u201d Winter said. \u201cMany of us in the industry are calling it the golden era of the utilities.\u201d\n\nStill, risks abound, as illustrated by PG&E. The company\u2019s latest stock collapse was sparked by a bankruptcy court judge ruling that its bondholders could submit their own reorganization plans for the company, potentially wiping out shareholders. The company had already slumped over 75% over the past year after wildfires its equipment caused saddled the utility with $30 billion in liabilities.\n\nThe company is carrying out the largest blackout ever orchestrated in California to prevent electrical lines igniting wildfires during a period of high winds. The unprecedented power shutdown has ensnared millions of people, many in the San Francisco Bay area, and raised the prospect that much of a major metropolitan area could go days without electricity.\n\nUtility Headwinds\n\nIt\u2019s not just PG&E that faces headwinds. Dominion and Duke Energy Corp., for example, back a $7.5 billion gas pipeline project that has been tied up in court. Southern is still working on a $28 billion nuclear plant expansion -- the only such project in the U.S.\n\nIf interest rates start rising again, some of the money now flowing into utility stocks could shift to bonds instead, according to Andy Smith, utilities analyst for Edward Jones. However, it\u2019s possible the market has entered an extended period of higher valuations for utility stocks, rather than a short-term spike, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything bringing them back down, other than interest rates,\u201d Smith said.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David R.
