The Post's reporting confirms one Democratic lawmaker's report coming out of closed-door testimony on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials told the Post that Mulvaney often met with Sondland and that details of their conversations were kept from then-national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions Democrats see John Bolton as potential star witness Syria furor underscores Trump's isolation MORE and others who had expressed concerns about the White House\u2019s efforts regarding Ukraine.\n\nMulvaney also allowed meetings between Trump and Giuliani as Giuliani publicly discussed his efforts to lobby Kiev into investigating conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nAccording to the report, Mulvaney also, at Trump\u2019s behest, put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in the weeks before Trump held a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressured him to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrGiuliani says he won't comply with subpoenas from Democrats Barr bemoans 'moral upheaval' that has brought 'suffering and misery' Trump threatens to sue Schiff and Pelosi MORE to investigate Biden, a phone call that has, in part, triggered the House\u2019s impeachment investigation.\n\nMulvaney reportedly told staff that the money to Kiev could be turned on and off without legal repercussions, though some questioned the legality of putting the aid on hold.\n\nOfficials told the Post that the shadow campaign to get Kiev to politically benefit Trump could not have been conducted without Mulvaney\u2019s facilitation of meetings and blocking the aid.\n\nA former South Carolina congressman who was installed as chief of staff in January, Mulvaney has appeared more eager than his predecessors to follow Trump\u2019s commands and has shirked past efforts to curtail the number of staffers who have direct access to the president.\n\n\u201cMulvaney has really abdicated the most important duty of any White House chief of staff, and that\u2019s to tell the president hard truths,\u201d Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a book about past White House chiefs of staff, told the Post. \u201cHe really should have thrown his body in front of that phone call with Zelensky.\u201d\n\nA declassified copy of a whistleblower complaint regarding the call said that a future phone call or meeting between the two presidents \u201cwould depend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge\u201d of the call were alarmed that Trump appeared to be using his office for his personal political gain and sought to bury the transcript of the conversation.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to the decision to block the aid as evidence that Trump may have abused his power to leverage the aid in an attempt to pressure Zelensky to comply with his request to investigate the Bidens.\n\nZelensky said last week there was \u201cno blackmail\u201d during a phone call and that he and Trump did not discuss the military aid.", "description": "Acting\u00a0White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was deeply involved in the White House\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, coordinating more with diplomats and other administration officials than previously known, according to a\u00a0report in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaneymick_090919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
