(Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nRob \u201cGronk\u201d Gronkowski is coming back to Gillette Stadium.\n\nThe recently-retired New England Patriots tight end and CBDMedic spokesperson is taking his role to new heights, serving as the face of the brand on its latest billboards coming to Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place. It\u2019s a first-of-its-kind partnership that includes a new look for the water tower, and Gronkowski hopes his former teammates will get a kick out of seeing him again.\n\n\u201cI hope they have a big smile on their face when they get to look at me again,\u201d Gronkowski tells Yahoo Lifestyle. When asked if the 6-foot-6 athlete\u2019s signature grin will bring a smile to notoriously straight-faced Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, he laughs. \u201cMaybe like, a quarter smile.\u201d\n\nGronkowski first discovered CBDMedic this summer after he injured three toes and his dad suggested a natural approach to pain relief.\n\n\u201cThey were black and blue. It was really painful and I couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d he explains. \u201cFifteen minutes later, it gave me that relief and I could put my shoes back on and go about my day.\u201d After using the CBDMedic Sport Pain Relief Stick ($40) for three days straight, Gronkowski was so sold on cannabidiol and the brand\u2019s efficacious products, he became an official spokesperson in August.\n\nMade with a blend of THC-free hemp oil and analgesic menthol and camphor, the stick is now among Gronk\u2019s favorite CBDMedic products.\n\n\u201cIt just works well. It doesn\u2019t get sloppy\u2014you don\u2019t have to put the cream on your hands,\u201d he explains. \u201cI love the Sport Stick because you can just apply it to any area very easily.\u201d\n\nAnd although the 30-year-old isn\u2019t catching touchdown passes this season, he maintains an active lifestyle and also relies on the Foot & Ankle Pain Relief Stick ($40) for pain management.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still active, I\u2019m still competing, I\u2019m working out, I\u2019m staying jacked,\u201d he says. \u201cI do different variations of workouts from band workouts to yoga or just going out to the park to play basketball or the backyard, running around or swimming. So, I use the stick whenever my muscles get sore and when everything starts aching.\u201d\n\nGronkowski notes that he\u2019s bringing his famous Stadium Blitz 5K obstacle course to Tampa\u2019s Raymond James Stadium this weekend. \u201cWhat better way to compliment it than with CBDMedic for recovery?\u201d\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
