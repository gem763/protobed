If he makes his final two scheduled starts, he will match a career-high with 34.\n\nIn his 31 starts this season, Bumgarner has a 3.77 ERA with 184 strikeouts in 188 2/3 innings.\n\nWhile those numbers are respectable, that ERA would be the worst of his career.\n\nStill, Bumgarner holds tremendous value for any prospective team, including possibly with the Giants. Aside from freak injuries, he's a workhorse who takes the ball every fifth day without complaint.\n\nStory continues\n\nBumgarner has one of the most decorated postseason resumes, so perennial contenders like the Yankees and Braves would be perfect fits for the 2014 World Series MVP.\n\n[RELATED: Bumgarner could lead NL in innings pitched]\n\nIt will be fascinating to watch the market for Bumgarner play out this offseason. Giants fans understand his value, but MLB teams might not fully appreciate what he brings to the table and undervalue him because he's 30 years old and has never won a Cy Young. But you're paying for the no-nonsense workhorse.\n\nOur advice to interested teams?
