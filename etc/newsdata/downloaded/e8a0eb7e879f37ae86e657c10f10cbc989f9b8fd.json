In a new Instagram post shared to her account, the Love Island presenter, 39, enthused she's 'over the moon' to front her first show for the broadcaster\n\nIn good spirits: The ITV star gushed to fans: 'Over the Mooooooon to be hosting my first @channel4 show \u2764\ufe0f #thesurjury @gemflossi @styledbynana @nisha_stylist'\n\nStrong career: The Strictly star rose to fame as a host on a series of ITV shows, including The X Factor (pictured with Olly Murs in November 2015) and more recently, Love Island\n\nCaroline's new show recently wrapped up filming in Manchester, and is expected to air on Channel 4 in early 2020.\n\nGobstopper Television is also filming a U.S. version of the format, according to Deadline.\n\nMailOnline has contacted Caroline and Channel 4 representatives for further comment.\n\nEarlier this year, medical professionals warned of the potential harm of the programme, saying it glamorises and trivialises life-changing procedures, and could lead to a rise in botched surgeries.\n\nControversy: Earlier this year, surgeons condemned the programme for 'glamorising' procedures (file photo)\n\nLow-key: The TV personality opted for a dressed-down appearance as she stepped out with her pet pooch for a casual stroll in the English capital\n\nOff she goes: The former Bo' Selecta! star wrapped up against the chilly climes in a khaki green parka jacket\n\nPlot: Caroline's new show will see young people pitch ideas for their 'dream' surgeries to convince a jury of peers and experts to approve their life-changing operations\n\nChannel 4 director Ian Katz said the aim of the broadcaster was to 'make entertaining, mischievous and innovative shows about the big issues and arguments in Britain today'.\n\nThe British Association Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) president and surgeon Mark Henley said: 'We are extremely concerned about the message this programme portrays and its particular focus on young people.\n\n'Based on the promotional materials alone, we believe the show will trivialise the serious decision all should take when considering aesthetic procedures.\n\n'It is disappointing that, in 2019, we are still having to remind large broadcasters of the potential harm caused by glamorising cosmetic surgery - particularly when targeting young adults or those with self-esteem issues.'\n\nChannel 4 said in promoting the show: 'From bum-lifts to nose jobs, sculpted abs to breast enlargements, The Surjury allows people to explore their choices more thoroughly.'\n\nSurgeons have suggested many people who have gone under the knife are less confident after a procedure than they were before.\n\nFamous face: The blonde beauty is best known for her appearance on dating series Love Island (pictured last year)\n\nMark added: 'There is every chance that a show like The Surjury - which asks young people to 'pitch' their 'dream' surgery to a panel - will encourage viewers to rush into personal decisions about cosmetic procedures without considering all outcomes and risks, or taking the time to ensure they visit a reputable surgeon.\n\n'This is particularly a concern given the frequency with which BAPRAS surgeons are having to perform complicated reconstructive procedures on individuals who have received 'botched surgery' both at home and abroad.'\n\nRoss McCarthy, executive producer for Gobstopper, said when the show was first announced: 'This is a totally new way of doing peer-to-peer advice.\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said: 'Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly mainstream.\n\n'Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\n'The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities.\n\n'All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord. All contributors will be independently assessed by the clinic who will carry out their procedure.'", "description": "In an Instagram post shared to her account on Tuesday, the Love Island presenter, 39, enthused she's 'over the moon' to front her first show for the broadcaster.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo", "Dianne Apen-Sadler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19761266-0-image-a-73_1571176430084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
