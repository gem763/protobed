Owning a Dog Might Help.", "language": "en", "text": "Good news for dog lovers who also enjoy being alive: new research suggests that owning a dog can actually help you live longer.\n\nAccording to CNN, a new review published Tuesday in the American Heart Association journal Circulation found that dog ownership is linked to a 24 percent reduction in mortality.\n\n\u201cOur analysis found having a dog is actually protective against dying of any cause,\u201d said Mount Sinai endocrinologist Dr. Caroline Kramer, lead author of the study, which reviewed nearly 70 years of global research involving 4 million people in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile these numbers corresponded with a reduction in \u201call cause mortality,\u201d the research revealed even more significant benefits for people with existing cardiovascular conditions, such as those who had previously had a heart attack or stroke.\n\n\u201cFor those people, having a dog was even more beneficial. They had a 31 percent reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular disease,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nHowever, the study was observational, meaning that researchers couldn\u2019t prove direct causation between dog ownership and increased life expectancy. As Dr. Martha Gulati, editor-in-chief of CardioSmart.org, told CNN, there are other factors that may contribute to dog owners\u2019 overall better health.\n\n\u201cIs it the dog or is it the behaviors?\u201d said Gulati. \u201cIs it because you\u2019re exercising or is it because there is a difference in the type of person who would choose to have a dog versus somebody who would not? Are they healthier or wealthier? We don\u2019t know those things.\u201d\n\nObservational or not, the numbers certainly paint a nice picture, so if you\u2019re already interested in acquiring a dog, it might be worth a shot. While the American Heart Association maintains that cardiovascular health shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s sole motivation for pet ownership, the chance of a longer life seems like a good enough reason to get a dog, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at CNN", "description": "A new review of over 70 years of global research found that dog ownership is linked to a 24 percent reduction in mortality.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dogs_Live_Longer.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
