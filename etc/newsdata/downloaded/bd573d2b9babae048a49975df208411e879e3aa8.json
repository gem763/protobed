That enabled a fine-grain analysis of residential solar power at a neighborhood level.\n\nWhy it matters: The firm intends its localized data to help policymakers better understand where solar power is being adopted and why \u2014 and help homeowners understand if they can get state-specific incentives for going solar.\n\nSolar power currently provides roughly 2% of U.S. electricity, and while it's growing fast, advocates hope to see even faster deployment.\n\nCape Analytics marketing head Kayvan Farzaneh tells Axios the company is \"not in the business of selling solar panels, but of course we're supporters of renewable energy.\"\n\nWhat they found: Every \"super solar\" neighborhood in the U.S. \u2014 those with over 500 homes and solar systems \u2014 is in California, except for one in Saint Petersburg, Florida, which is 13.2% solar.\n\nDallas and Miami have nearly the same number of sunny days per year, but Florida has more tax credits and incentives for going solar than Texas.\n\nAnd while California is far and away the nation's solar leader, Cape Analytics' data shows how its distribution there is uneven.\n\nThe big picture: Cape Analytics examined the entire U.S., Farzaneh tells Axios. The company has access to addresses of nearly all homes in America, Farzaneh said, and currently works with many U.S. property insurance companies.\n\n\"We\u2019re the first in the insurance industry to be doing this, at this kind of scale \u2026 as far as I know,\" Farzaneh said. Cape Analytics supplies home insurance providers with AI-extracted data on roof conditions, overhanging trees, pools, and other factors that could affect insurance policies.\n\nIn creating this new report, Cape Analytics says it did not use specific home addresses. The company's aerial imagery partners gathered data from neighborhoods as groups.\n\nGo deeper: Solar power systems spike in homes, businesses and industrial plants", "description": "A new analysis uses AI to track solar panels via high-resolution aerial imagery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/g7mgf4gZijep49MvpF2vIfi8QH4=/184x117:2146x1219/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572382409362.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
