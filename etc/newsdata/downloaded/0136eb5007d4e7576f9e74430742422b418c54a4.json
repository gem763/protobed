My job, if you\u2019re willing to call it one, is not merely to consume food, but also to spend hours hearing about the concepts behind each restaurant. This is where I earn my money: deciphering the arduous Vogon poetics on websites about seasonal produce, the chef\u2019s old nonna, or complete curveballs such as: \u201cYou thought you liked cheese... but have you ever tried it delivered on a sushi conveyor belt?\u201d That\u2019s a real thing, by the way, called Pick & Cheese, in Covent Garden.\n\nAnyhow, the men behind Pilgrim take concept to a higher, more godly level, basing their restaurant around the pilgrimage routes towards Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of St James were found in the ninth century. Or, more specifically, the Camino del Norte route, which is 825km of rugged coastline between Irun, outside San Sebastian, turning inland at Ribadeo in the Galician hills to Santiago.\n\nDuke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun ....\n\nOK, it\u2019s a Spanish restaurant. And some of the stuff is on small plates, so you could even say it\u2019s tapas, but I like Pilgrim\u2019s swagger. Having grown up around Scousers, never knowingly out of six-foot range of a prayer card, a devotional portrait, or just a plan to go somewhere to worship someone, I find this saint-chasing shtick rather comforting. Especially if it involves Cantabrian boquerones, peralzola cheese, allioli, sofrito, live fire hearths and a lot of cold, white, organic xarel\u00b7lo.\n\nPilgrim lives on the upper deck of Duke Street Market, which is what we\u2019re loosely calling right now in restaurant-land \u201ca food hall\u201d, although that\u2019s a catch-all term that doesn\u2019t really work, because the hospitality at each different venue works in a slightly different way. For me, 2019 has been a year of loitering confusedly in food halls, gob ajar, trying to decipher where one eats, sits, orders and pays. Duke Street Market is the first set-up with the stark gumption to put an effusive staff member at the front door chivvying the customers for Asian bowl-food kitchen Ginger or vegan counter Indigo Greens over to the communal benches, while directing Pilgrims like me to the more formal restaurant up a flight of stairs, where a mezzanine overlooks the fun.\n\nBecause Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun. This is a 19th-century warehouse with exposed brick walls and a thunderous sound system. I tried three different tables before accepting that this was going to feel like eating gordal olives during a 1995 Dave Morales set at Cream, but at least this time I would be wearing actual clothes, not merely a Morgan De Toi pelmet and body butter.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pilgrim\u2019s runner beans with sofrito and smoked tomatoes: \u2018Green beans on red sauce shouldn\u2019t taste that good.\u2019\n\nThe trick is to order a large red vermouth on ice as a pre-starter and go with the rumpus.\n\nWe began with good, fresh house bread with smoked butter and a plate of silver-skinned, delicious boquerones, marinated in sweet vinegar. A plate of fresh, green, defiantly al dente runner beans arrived on a puddle of the deepest, oiliest, most garlicky sofrito strewn with small, piquant, smoked cherry tomatoes. Green beans on red sauce shouldn\u2019t taste that good. Sure, I\u2019d have cooked the beans longer. Same, too for chargrilled leeks. I can only guess that the chef came from a family like mine, where Christmas sprouts were put on to simmer some time in late November, and has spent a culinary journey rebelling. We demolished the leeks nevertheless as they arrived, slathered in light-blue-veined cow\u2019s cheese, scattered with delicately candied walnut.\n\nI can\u2019t pretend the food at Pilgrim was perfect; a piece of monkfish tail in a vivid orange pimiento glaze was overcooked and slightly bizarre-tasting. But then a txuleton sirloin, served \u2013 no ifs or buts \u2013 rare, was a huge success on our table, arriving with a pond-green Castilian salsa heaving with thickly sliced melting onions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pilgrim\u2019s St James tart: \u2018One of the greatest things I\u2019ve tasted this year.\u2019\n\nPilgrim is a restaurant I want to return to again and again out of sheer curiosity. Their holy, walking-tour concept doesn\u2019t stifle them, but gives them a clear base for a foray into exquisite produce. The St James tart that Pilgrim served at the end \u2013 despite being, dare I say it, \u201cdeconstructed\u201d \u2013 was one of the greatest things I\u2019ve tasted this year. A slice of sticky, caramelised-edged sponge with a stew of burnt apple and fennel was served with soothing, sweet, milky ice-cream. Not the prettiest of puddings. Not the showiest. A cacophony of beige.\n\nProbably not worth walking 825km in sandals for; but if I can travel up the M6 on a Megabus, then I\u2019ll make a pilgrimage again this year.\n\n\u2022 Pilgrim 46 Duke Street, Liverpool, 07388 120098.
