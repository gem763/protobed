Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8. Michael Leitch (Japan) Another substitute who made such a strong contribution to a winning cause.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power.

Telusa Veainu (Tonga) The full-back returned to the Tonga side for the first time in two years and marked his comeback with a brilliant showing, scoring twice in their losing effort against Argentina and producing a sublime finish for his second try after combining with Cooper Vuna.

AP\n\nBut the timing of his social media exit raised eyebrows as World Rugby had faced growing criticism over the first two weeks of the tournament. The governing body issued an extraordinary statement on 24 September to state that the standard of refereeing over the course of the first seven games of the tournament \u201cwere not consistently of the standards set\u201d at the highest level of the game. Gosper\u2019s account was deactivated at some point on the same day.\n\nWorld Rugby have also moved to clarify decisions made by Australian referee Angus Gardner in Ireland\u2019s shock loss against tournament hosts Japan last Saturday, with an admission that he made three incorrect offside calls against the Irish that contributed to their defeat.\n\nHead coach Joe Schmidt revealed that the normal post-game communications between his team and World Rugby confirmed that Ireland should not have had three of the four offside calls made against them, and Schmidt even highlighted how that could impact their next match against Russia given that Jerome Garces will referee it, having been the assistant referee who made two of those three decisions.\n\n\"We were penalised for offside four times and we've now got the feedback that three of those were incorrect calls,\u201d said Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt. \u201cPeople were asking us about our discipline.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to keep getting off the line and onto the front foot when you are getting those calls. Two of them were from an assistant referee who is going to be refereeing us on Thursday (Jerome Garces), so we know we\u2019re going to have to be on our best behaviour.\n\n\"One thing I would say about this team is that they try to go out and deliver and, generally speaking, it's unusual for us to have a higher penalty count than our opponents.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s frustrating that in the first two games, I thought Wayne [Barnes] did a super job. I know that, to a degree, they were happy with how Wayne went in the first game [against Scotland] as well. That\u2019s our fault if we were on the wrong side of the penalty count there but I do think we\u2019ve got to try to look after that as best we can.\u201d", "description": "World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper has deactivated his Twitter account in a surprise move midway through the Rugby World Cup in Japan.
