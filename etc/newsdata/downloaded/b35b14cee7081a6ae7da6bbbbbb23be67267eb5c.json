Holtz", "language": "en", "text": "The Washington Redskins released 2018 seventh-round cornerback Greg Stroman and tight end J.P. Holtz on Tuesday and signed two players to replace them.\n\nStroman, who started three games last season, was released with an injury designation. The Virginia Tech product played two defensive snaps and 18 special teams snaps in Sunday\u2019s loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nHoltz, meanwhile, was promoted to the active roster over the weekend with tight end Jordan Reed out with a concussion. While Holtz\u2019s release may seem like a good sign for Reed\u2019s status in Week 2 against the Dallas Cowboys, ESPN reported Holtz suffered a groin injury.\n\nIn corresponding moves, the Redskins signed cornerback Simeon Thomas off of Seattle\u2019s practice squad and defensive lineman T.Y. McGill.\n\nThomas, a 2018 sixth-round draft pick out of Louisiana, has yet to make his NFL debut, but has spent time with the Cleveland Browns and the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMcGill, a 6-foot, 300-pound lineman, entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2015. The Redskins are already McGill\u2019s seventh team as the journeyman has previously signed with the Seahawks, Colts, Browns, Chiefs, Chargers and Eagles. He has five career sacks in 34 games.\n\nThe Redskins\u2018 roster now features seven defensive linemen, but that might appears to be out of necessity. Washington likes to keep five linemen active on game-days and Jonathan Allen (knee sprain) and Caleb Brantley (foot aggravation) are both day to day with injuries.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
