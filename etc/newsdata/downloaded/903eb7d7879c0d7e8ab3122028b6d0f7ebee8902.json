It has both the track record and the most available synergies given its existing footprint. Investment bank UBS is tending to Tabcorp.\n\nWA and its advisers will be seeking to draw in offshore-owned corporate bookmakers into the auction, including Sportsbet, BetEasy and Ladbrokes. Sportsbet and Ladbrokes have experience operating betting shops in their home markets, and each is expected to at least take a look at the WA opportunity.\n\nInterested parties were asked to formally express their interest in WA TAB and expect formal sale documents in November.
