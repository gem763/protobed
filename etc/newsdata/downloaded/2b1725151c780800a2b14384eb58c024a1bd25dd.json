To do so, we looked at 21 years of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, defining autumn as the first five consecutive days in which the high was lower than 70 percent of a region\u2019s yearly range in temperatures. (For example, a place with yearly lows of 10 and yearly highs of 90 would have a \u201cfall line\u201d of 66 degrees, which is 70 percent of the distance between those extremes.) Enter your city or county below to see when you can expect cooler weather in your neighborhood.\n\nThis sort of analysis is more Farmer\u2019s Almanac than fine meteorology, but in most cases summer does overstay its welcome for at least a few days. In playing around with our own interactive, we found many instances of fake outs in which there would be a few fall-like days in August or early September followed by a resurgence of sweltering weather.\n\nMethodology\n\nWeather data can be as finicky as the weather itself as measuring stations go on and offline. For this interactive, we looked at the five closest weather stations to the center of a city or county, limiting the search to stations that have been active since 1995. We then averaged the high temperature for each of those stations for each day from Jan. 1, 1995 to the present. In limited cases in rural areas, there were not five stations within a 50-miles radius.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-21-at-12-06-10-am.png"}
