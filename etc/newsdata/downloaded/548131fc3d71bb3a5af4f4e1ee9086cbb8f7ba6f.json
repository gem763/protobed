Neuroblastoma most commonly occurs in one of the adrenal glands situated above the kidneys, or in the nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord in the neck, chest, tummy or pelvis. It can spread to other organs such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin. It affects around 100 children each year in the UK and is most common in children under the age of 5. The cause is unknown. There are very rare cases where children in the same family are affected, but generally neuroblastoma doesn't run in families.\n\nThe pictures, shot by photographer Ami Barwell, have been released as part of Stand Up To Cancer, a joint fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.\n\nMoney raised through the campaign will speed up advances in life-saving cancer research.\n\nDoctors, nurses, scientists and celebrities join the campaign each year for the cause.\n\nAnd for those who want to take on cancer in style, there\u2019s also a range of Stand Up To Cancer clothing and accessories available online.\n\n(Image: Copyright Ami Barwell 2019.

Her defiance truly encapsulates what Stand Up To Cancer is all about.\n\n\"We\u2019ve made amazing progress against the disease over the past few decades but one in two people will be diagnosed in their lifetime. That\u2019s why our scientists are carrying out pioneering research every day, taking developments in the lab and working to accelerate them into brand new treatments.\n\n\"We hope that by seeing Tasha\u2019s picture, people across Leicestershire will be inspired to get involved in any way they can.\"", "description": "Tasha Jilka, from Hamilton, Leicester, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, which has affected her face and nose, but is now taking part in a Stand Up To Cancer campaign", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Tom Mack", "Image", "Copyright", "Copyright Ami Barwell All Rights Reserved."], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662131.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TM_TEM_151019jilka_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
