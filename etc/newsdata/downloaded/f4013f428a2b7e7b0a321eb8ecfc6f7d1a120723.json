No one besides Cohen was charged, though prosecutors said in public court filings that Trump himself was aware of and directed the payments.\n\nThe Trump Organization also reimbursed Cohen for money he paid to Daniels. Cohen has argued that organization officials disguised the true nature of the payments and that it is unfair he is the only one prosecuted.\n\nThe federal inquiry looked at whether campaign finance laws were broken.\n\nThe New York Times reported, citing \u201cpeople briefed on the matter,\u201d that Vance\u2019s inquiry involves an examination of whether anyone at the Trump Organization falsified business records by falsely listing the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense.\n\nFalsifying business records can be a crime under state law.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Condon at twitter.com/BernardFCondon", "description": "A lawyer for the Trump Organization, Marc Mukasey, said he is \u201cevaluating the situation and will respond as appropriate.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ff159240000d3267bba3e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
