After several minutes he was able to walk to the Dodgers dug-out.\n\nMay said the ball grazed his glove before it hit his hand, slowing down a bit and mitigating the damage.\n\n\"When it hit me at first it really just frightened me,\" he said. \"Then when I was on the ground, it was like, 'Well, dang, I wish that wouldn't have happened.'\"\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said May passed a concussion test but added that the team will \"keep an eye on him in the days following.\"\n\n\"That's never a good situation,\" Roberts said. \"I'm just happy it wasn't worse.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks scored two runs on the bases-loaded play as the ball deflected into left field for a single.\n\nThe Dodgers, however, went on to win in 11 innings.\n\nCody Bellinger hit a game-tying homer in the ninth inning and Joc Pederson belted the game-winning home run in the 11th.", "description": "Los Angeles pitcher Dustin May walked off under his own steam after taking a line drive to the head in the Dodgers' 4-3 Major League Baseball win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix.
