(Getty)\n\nIn 2018, Justify became the 13th horse to win thoroughbred racing\u2019s Triple Crown.\n\nOn Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the colt failed a drug test prior to the Kentucky Derby and shouldn\u2019t have been eligible to race to begin with.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Times reports that the horse tested positive for scopolamine, a banned performance-enhancer, after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018.\n\nReport: Baffert aware of positive test before Derby\n\nAccording to the report, California regulators waited nearly three weeks to notify Justify\u2019s trainer Bob Baffert of the positive test result, nine days before the May 5 running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe timeline means that Baffert entered his horse knowing about the positive test. Few others at the time were aware, according to the report.\n\nInstead of immediately disqualifying the Kentucky Derby favorite, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results and withheld from publicly disclosing the results when it did, according to the report.\n\nReport: Board changed rules after positive test\n\nThe board eventually decided to drop the case and moved to lessen the penalty for testing positive for scopolamine by the time Justify had won the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes to complete the Triple Crown, according to the report.\n\nThe Times reports that two months after Justify completed the Triple Crown, the board concluded that the positive test could have resulted from Justify eating contaminated food and dropped the inquiry before changing the penalty of a positive scopolamine test to a fine and possible suspension in October.\n\nCalifornia Horse Racing Board director Rick Baedeker told the Times that it moved slowly on the case due to the nature of the positive test.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere was no way that we could have come up with an investigative report prior to the Kentucky Derby,\u201d Baedeker said. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Well, that\u2019s not impossible, that would have been careless and reckless for us to tell an investigator what usually takes you two months, you have to get done in five days, eight days. We weren\u2019t going to do that.\u201d\n\nBaffert did not respond to the Times\u2019 request for comment.\n\nJustify won the 150th running on the Belmont Stakes to complete the 13th Triple Crown in horse racing history. (Getty)\n\nExpert: Test results indicate intentional doping\n\nThe report notes that the presence of jimson weed that is sometimes found in horse feed can result in a positive test for scopolamine.\n\nThe Times spoke with Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018. He said that the amount found in Justify\u2019s system \u2014 300 milligrams \u2014 via documents obtained by the Times indicated that its administration was intentional.\n\n\u201cI think it has to come from intentional intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nBaffert\u2019s 2013 trouble around horse deaths\n\nThe California Horse Racing Board investigated Baffert in 2013 when seven of his horses unexpectedly died at Inglewood\u2019s Hollywood Park over the course of 16 months.\n\nBaffert was found to have administered thyroid hormone thyroxine to the horses despite there being no evidence of hypothyroidism that the hormone is intended to treat.\n\nBaffert was exonerated after the board determined that the administration of the drug did not violate any rules.\n\n\u201cIt was legally dispensed and reported as labeled,\u201d Dr. Rick Arthur said after overseeing necropsies of the dead horses. \u201cIt was within their right to do so. There is no violation of any rules. You want to have an \u2018Aha!\u2019 moment, but this was used in his stable all the time.\u201d\n\nJustify was estimated to be valued at $75 million after securing the Triple Crown.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert was reportedly aware of Justify's positive drug test before his horse ran the 2018 Kentucky Derby.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/36FlbZkFWt7ovaGPN4T2_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BvADEAMb4f_FgJzCvXU.1A--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/13f76680-d4e9-11e9-abed-50d30abc2065", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
