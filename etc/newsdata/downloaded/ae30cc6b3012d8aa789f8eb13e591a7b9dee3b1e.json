There\u2019s often so much lingo and history to lay out that writers have to choose between clumsy information dumps, or leaving their setting unexplained for long stretches, so they can get to the action. By the time a film\u2019s original science fiction or fantasy setting starts feeling familiar, it\u2019s about time for the credits to roll. That\u2019s one of the many reasons studios find it so irresistible to turn these titles into franchises. By the second outing, the groundwork has already been laid, and the writers can hit the ground running. The challenge is producing a first film that\u2019s worthy of a sequel.\n\nAlita: Battle Angel, based on Yukito Kishiro\u2019s 1990s manga series Battle Angel Alita, is a triumph of worldbuilding and a failure of storytelling. The film is set in a distant future following a devastating war that leveled all but one of Earth\u2019s great floating cities. That last survivor, Zalem, is fueled by the factories of Iron City, and the humans and cyborgs who live in Zalem\u2019s shadow literally feed off its scraps while dreaming of a better life above. Scrounging for spare parts amid the trash Zalem dumps down to Earth, the kindly cybernetics genius Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) discovers a cyborg girl who\u2019s still alive, and repairs and adopts her.\n\nThe amnesiac Alita (Rosa Salazar) progresses from wonderstruck child to moody teenager over the course of days, rebelling from Ido\u2019s fatherly protectiveness to spend time with her generic \u201ccriminal with a heart of gold\u201d boyfriend Hugo (Keean Johnson). Alita has a particularly good reason for thrill-seeking, as a battle against the cyborg equivalent of Jack the Ripper triggers some memories of her past life, and convinces her that more violent conflict might reveal more information. Like a video game hero, Alita progresses through the film, earning gear upgrades and memories of extremely lethal martial arts that allow her to take on increasingly more powerful threats.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 game plot isn\u2019t helped by the film\u2019s cartoonishly evil villains. Jennifer Connelly plays Chiren, Ido\u2019s haughty, morally compromised ex and fellow cybersurgeon. She stands out from the grittier denizens of Iron City, with her fine clothes and a forehead gem which looks distractingly like a BIM mark from the trash classic The Apple. Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), the hulking murderous cyborg hunting Alita for much of the film, at one point literally kills a dog just to show how irredeemably evil he is. Moonlight\u2019s Mahershala Ali fares a bit better, by virtue of a plot quirk that has him alternately playing sports mogul Vector, and Zalem\u2019s maniacal ruler Nova. But his acting talents are largely wasted on the clunky script, written by James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis.\n\nToo much of the film is devoted to Alita and Hugo\u2019s YA romance and to \u201cmotorball,\u201d a sport that provides the same action setpieces and irrelevant narrative filler as Harry Potter\u2019s Quidditch or The Legend of Korra\u2019s pro-bending. The only clear way to make it from Iron City to Zalem is to become motorball\u2019s champion, making it an obsession of scrappy teens like Hugo, who play it with little more than motorized rollerblades, skateboard ramps, and a ball. But practiced professionally, it\u2019s more like the eponymous event in Death Race, a sport for athletes who have traded most of their bodies for cybernetics, and are ready to creatively eviscerate each other for control of the ball. The fact that they can survive nearly anything, since they\u2019re only losing metal bits, lets Alita deliver some pretty brutal fights while maintaining its PG-13 rating.\n\nThe movie\u2019s action is phenomenal, especially in 3D, where the motorball matches and fight scenes send balls and all manner of vicious weapons at viewers. Director Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Spy Kids, Sin City) does excellent work with the CGI-dominated battles, bringing the film\u2019s anime and cyberpunk aesthetics to life, and taking advantage of the impossible feats cyborgs can perform. Characters like the scythe-wielding organ harvester Nyssiana (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) are barely human: when cornered, Nyssiana leaps upward, flips the angle of her limbs, and pins herself to the side of an alley, hissing at Alita like a cat. In one particularly thrilling and surprising battle, Alita leaps at Grewishka through a cyclone of chains. There\u2019s also a spectacular brawl at a bounty-hunter bar that lets a wide variety of minor characters show off their skills, including the cowboy-esque McTeague (Jeff Fahey) and his pack of cyborg dogs.\n\nMore subtle visuals are similarly striking. Cybernetics isn\u2019t just for killers and athletes in Alita\u2019s world: it\u2019s remarkable to see the variety of technology, and how well the filmmakers integrate it into the bustling multicultural city, in ways as simple as a street musician playing a double guitar with three arms. There\u2019s a quiet beauty to the animation of Alita\u2019s exposed heart, simultaneously pumping blood to her brain and an unspecified blue fluid to her cyborg parts. While there\u2019s absolutely nothing subtle in the film\u2019s metaphors about upward social mobility and class stratification, there\u2019s some nice nuance to its take on being comfortable in your own body, whatever that body is made of, and the inevitable divides that would come from the prominence of cybernetic technology. When one of Hugo\u2019s buddies expresses skepticism about his new girlfriend, his primary complaint is that he\u2019s not into \u201chardbodies.\u201d\n\nThe hints about Alita\u2019s identity, the intrigue in Zalem, and the events that led to the fall of the other cities are tantalizing and frustratingly scarce compared to Alita\u2019s time with Hugo. It\u2019s hard to care about his generic advice about staying true to your dreams, or about Alita\u2019s introduction to chocolate, when it\u2019s coming at the cost of fights on the moon and elite Martian soldiers training in space. The reason those details are so scarce becomes clear at the film\u2019s unsatisfying conclusion, which is meant as setup for a sequel. The ending is strangely similar to that of 2006\u2019s Eragon, attempting to build excitement by revealing the big-name actor playing the main villain. But Eragon was a financial disappointment in the US, the sequel was never made, and John Malkovich never got to really play King Galbatorix. Alita: Battle Angel is a much stronger movie, so it\u2019s more likely to find its franchise footing. But it\u2019s a shame that the film doesn\u2019t stand on its own, with a story as creative and engaging as its setting.", "description": "Robert Rodriguez\u2019s film, based on a celebrated manga series, is mostly a vehicle for tremendous fights and disappointing sequel setup. Rosa Salazar stars as Alita, an amnesiac cyborg rescued from a junk heap by Christoph Waltz, and slowly recovering her memory through a series of thrilling battles. It\u2019s a visually impressive movie, but the story is disappointingly predictable and weighed down with a weak YA romance.", "authors": ["Samantha Nelson", "Feb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lk1x5Li4Iht1STJWdtciHYhSnM=/0x0:1800x942/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13730747/__5a2ae6f40039e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-01"}
