The NIS typically doesn't comment on the contents of closed-door briefings it provides to lawmakers.\n\nU.S.-led diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear crisis have largely remained stalled since the second Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam in February ended without any agreement due to squabbling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at a Korean border village in late June and agreed to resume talks.\n\nIn recent month, North Korea carried out a series of short-range missile and other weapons tests in an apparent bid to apply pressure on the Washington and increase its leverage ahead in future talks. Kim has demanded Trump come up with mutually acceptable proposals to salvage diplomacy by the end of December.\n\nTrump has downplayed the significance of the recent North Korean weapons launches and said he's maintaining good relations with Kim.\n\nTrump provided few details in his comments Monday that another meeting with Kim \"could happen soon.\" He spoke in response to a question as he arrived at the United Nations in New York.\n\nOn the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting on Monday, Trump met South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Moon's office said the two leaders exchanged opinions on how to produce substantial progress in the working-level U.S.-North Korea talks and reaffirmed their resolve to improve ties with North Korea and establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDuring Tuesday's NIS briefing, the South Korean spy service also predicted the North Korean leader could visit China again to discuss the future of the nuclear diplomacy with his country's biggest ally and aid provider, according to Lee Eun-jae, another lawmaker who was present at the briefing.\n\nAfter entering talks with Trump last year, Kim has travelled to China four times to consult with President Xi Jinping. Xi went to Pyongyang in June, and some experts have speculated Kim will make a reciprocal trip to Beijing this year.\n\nLee cited the NIS as saying Kim may be able to attend a regional forum scheduled to take place in South Korea in November, depending on what progress is made in North Korea-U.S. diplomacy.\n\nAfter his summit with Kim in Pyongyang last September, Moon said Kim had promised to make a return trip to Seoul by the end of December 2018 and become the first North Korean leader to do so since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
