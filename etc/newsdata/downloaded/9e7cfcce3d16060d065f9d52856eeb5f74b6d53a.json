I think there\u2019s a lot of shame attached to it and a lot of sadness, and there\u2019s a lot of societal stigma about it. But I\u2019d rather talk about it than not talk about it,\u201d McCain said in an interview with \"Good Morning America\" released at the end of National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month.\n\nMcCain first revealed that she had miscarried over the summer, penning an emotional July op-ed in The New York Times titled \"What I learned from my miscarriage.\"\n\nMcCain said she considers the experience of losing her father, the late Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainKelly, McSally virtually tied in Arizona Senate race: poll Trump attacks on Vindman trigger backlash Democrats see hopes rise in Senate with impeachment MORE (R-Ariz.), and her baby during the same summer \u201cthis very strange circle of life experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always describe it as the inverse of losing my dad because my dad was, like, the ending of a beautiful, long-lived life, and I grieved that, and the way I grieved having a miscarriage and grieved my daughter was what could have been,\u201d she told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nMcCain also said she wanted to use her platform to discuss the difficult topic in order to support others in the same situation.\n\n\"I think oftentimes people tune in to the show, they probably think that we're leading these perfect lives and everything's wonderful,\" she said. \"There's actually a lot of intensity in any human's life, and I just thought after I had my miscarriage I should talk about it because everything I go through \u2014 I just want people to feel less alone because I felt very, very alone during the entire experience and afterward. I just felt like I have this huge platform. Why not? Why not use it to help other women feel less alone?\u201d\n\nMcCain also opened up about how her miscarriage impacted her work life. She had said in The New York Times op-ed that she had to take days off of work, which inspired rumors about why she was away from \"The View.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being a woman. It\u2019s just not, and I know how hard I was on myself, and I\u2019m sure other women do that same thing, and you just feel really alone. I felt so ashamed,\u201d McCain said.\n\n\u201cThere are all of these questions that only women have to answer. Women have to make different choices and have different experiences across the board than men do, and I think starting with motherhood is the perfect example of why it\u2019s just never going to be an equal experience across the board for a man hosting a political show versus a woman,\u201d she added.\n\nBut McCain said she found support and grew close with other women who had miscarriages.

And it's a very specific moment in time that was very, very hard for both of us that made us bond.\"", "description": "\u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain opened up Wednesday about having a miscarriage,\u00a0saying that the experience left her feeling \u201calone\u201d and \u201cashamed\u201d but that she hopes she can use her platform to help other women.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mccainmeghan_080119.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
