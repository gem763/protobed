I\u2019m not good enough?\u201d Jenner asks.\n\nThe billionaire beauty mogul went viral this week for a three-second clip from a 16-minute video tour of the lavishly extra Kylie Cosmetics headquarters.\n\nAfter touring the colossal office space \u2015 which features giant neon letters spelling out Jenner\u2019s name, a champagne vending machine, a bouquet of \u201cmoney flowers,\u201d and pink M&Ms printed with Jenner\u2019s face \u2015 Jenner said it was time to wake Stormi up.\n\nWalking into a dark room, Jenner flicked on the light, singing \u201crise and shine.\u201d Stormi was already awake, since a camera crew had apparently already entered the room to capture the moment.\n\nThe clip turned into a viral sensation, and multiple memes and remixes were born:\n\nno one:\n\njesus on the 3rd day: pic.twitter.com/CHTq9LpUWo \u2014 jay (@jaasmine_a) October 16, 2019\n\nJenner was presumably perusing some of these when she played the clip for Stormi. The mogul is evidently embracing her newfound meme status, having changed her Instagram bio to read \u201crise and shine.\u201d\n\nThe internet, as usual, did its thing, and Stormi\u2019s reaction has birthed... new memes:\n\nkylie jenner: I'm not good enough?\n\nstormi webster: daddy sing pic.twitter.com/3BL1LwQ2op \u2014 thamy (@stormiwebstr) October 17, 2019", "description": "The Kylie Cosmetics mogul's singing turned into a major meme this week, but Stormi only wants to listen to dad Travis Scott.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8ef682100001715ad322d.jpeg?cache=d60iup6juv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
