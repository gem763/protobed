Morgan in two years, analyst says", "language": "en", "text": "J.P. Morgan Chase has a reputation as the \u201cbest in class\u201d among the Big Four U.S. banks, but Bank of America might be a better investment if you hold the stock for the next few years, according to Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan.\n\nIn an interview Oct. 17, Shanahan pointed to Bank of America\u2019s BAC, +0.30% record $7.6 billion in share buybacks in the third quarter and massive investment in technology as catalysts for improving earnings performance and growing market share. (Buybacks lower the share count to boost earnings per share. They also reduce a bank\u2019s excess capital, which boosts returns on equity.)\n\nShanahan said better technology will enable the four largest U.S. banks to continue taking market share from smaller competitors.\n\n\u201cThe biggest banks are generating so much cash flow that they have the ability to make large and substantial investments in technology and leverage those investments into larger retail deposit footprints,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Big Four are investing $10 billion to $12 billion a year in new technology, Shanahan estimated. This will \u201ccreate a tech infrastructure smaller banks will not be able to compete with and will never catch up to,\u201d he said.\n\nShanahan expects the Big Four to leverage their growing deposit relationships \u201cacross services as they take more share over time.\u201d\n\nA valuation play\n\nAt its current level of profitability, Bank of America\u2019s shares should be trading higher, Shanahan argues. When discussing longer-term prospects, he said: \"They are kind of catching up, but within a couple of years they should reach a level of profitability similar to J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.56%. \u201d\n\nThat may seem a tall order. Let\u2019s take a look at valuations for the Big Four, which also include Citigroup C, +0.14% and Wells Fargo WFC, +0.04%.\n\nBank Ticker Closing price - Oct. 16 Tangible book value - Sept. 30 Consensus EPS estimate - next 12 months Price/ tangible book value Forward price/ earnings Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.30% $30.17 $19.26 $2.70 1.6 11.2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.56% $119.68 $60.48 $10.13 2.0 11.8 Citigroup Inc. C, +0.14% $69.50 $69.03 $7.53 1.0 9.2 Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.04% $49.59 $33.84 $4.63 1.5 10.7 Sources: FactSet, Edward Jones (tangible book values)\n\nSo Bank of America trades higher than Citigroup C, +0.14% and Wells Fargo WFC, +0.04%, but significantly lower, by both measures, than J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhen Shanahan spoke of \u201cprofitability,\u201d he specifically meant return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), which he said is \u201cthe measure we pay most attention to.\u201d For banks, the denominator of that ratio is total equity, less preferred equity, goodwill and intangible assets, including loan-servicing rights.\n\nHere are estimated 2019 returns on tangible equity for the Big Four, based on actual results for the first three quarters and Edward Jones\u2019 fourth-quarter estimates:\n\nBank Ticker Estimated ROTCE - 2019 Bank of America Corp. BAC 15.9% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM 19.1% Citigroup Inc. C 12.0% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC 13.9% Source: Edward Jones\n\nBank of America\u2019s estimated return on tangible equity still trails J.P. Morgan\u2019s by a wide margin, but it is also significantly higher than the estimates for Citigroup and Wells Fargo.\n\nShanahan actually has \u201cbuy\u201d ratings on Bank of America and J.P. Morgan. He believes J.P. Morgan\u2019s current premium valuation is justified because of \u201cconsistently stronger revenue and earnings growth, and industry-leading profitability,\u201d he wrote in an Oct. 15 report. But the following day, he wrote that Bank of America\u2019s price-to-tangible-book-value ratio of 1.6 was \u201cunwarranted\u201d because of its \u201cstrengthened financial condition and improved profitability.\u201d\n\nWall Street\u2019s view\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of opinion of the Big Four among analysts polled by FactSet:\n\nBank Ticker share 'buy' ratings Share neutral ratings Share 'sell' ratings Closing price - Oct. 16 Consensus price target Implied 12-month upside potential Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.30% 54% 46% 0% $30.17 $33.07 10% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.56% 44% 56% 0% $119.68 $122.50 2% Citigroup Inc. C, +0.14% 83% 13% 4% $69.50 $81.75 18% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.04% 19% 70% 11% $49.59 $49.70 0% Source: FactSet\n\nBank of American and Citigroup have majority \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, with Citi the current favorite among analysts as a remedial play on its low valuation (see the first table above).\n\nAll four can also be seen as dividend plays. Here are current yields along with how much each company raised its dividend after annual capital plans were approved by the Federal Reserve earlier this year:\n\nBank Ticker Dividend yield Most recent increase in quarterly dividend payout Bank of America Corp. BAC 2.39% 20.0% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM 3.01% 12.5% Citigroup Inc. C 2.94% 13.3% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC 4.11% 5.0% Source: FactSet\n\nEconomic outlook \u2014 a bright spot in third-quarter numbers\n\nAn interesting common theme Shanahan has observed this earnings season is continued strength in credit quality, particularly for U.S. consumers. Credit-card delinquencies typically increase during back-to-school shopping season, with non-performing card loans increasing through the holiday season, he said.\n\nBut despite some slowing of economic growth indicated by recent reports, third-quarter consumer-loan delinquencies \u201cdo not even reflect [normal] seasonal trends,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nThat is a big surprise and may point to better-than-expected strength for American consumers for some time.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This ETF can protect you from S&P 500 volatility and enhance your long-term returns\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "James Shanahan of Edward Jones argues that Bank of America\u2019s shares are undervalued.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT517_boa_ch_ZG_20191017101126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
