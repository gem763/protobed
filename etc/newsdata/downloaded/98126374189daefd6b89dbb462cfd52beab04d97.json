Sulzberger, promised readers that he would hold the paper he inherited from his father to \u201cthe highest standards of independence, rigor and fairness.\u201d Further, he vowed that the Grey Lady would resist \u201cpolarization and groupthink.\u201d\n\nHow is that going, Mr. Sulzberger? Is the Times exhibiting much \u201cfairness\u201d these days? Or have you traded integrity for a new lease on life as a radical voice of the anti-Trump mob?\n\nThe Times is in the crosshairs once again, for having published yet another non-credible smear against conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The story, which ran in the paper\u2019s opinion section this past weekend was authored by two Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. It was adapted from their soon-to-be-released book and claimed that Kavanaugh classmate Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\n\nLIZ HARRINGTON: THE KAVANAUGH SMEAR REVEALS WHY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET DEMOCRATS BACK IN POWER\n\nThe Times failed to mention that the partisan Stier had previously been Bill Clinton\u2019s defense attorney, or that Stier had engaged in legal battles with Kavanaugh in the course of the Whitewater investigation, but rather referred to him as a \"respected thought leader.\"\n\nMore importantly, the Times neglected to include the damning information that the female student supposedly involved in this episode denied any memory of the event and that efforts to find other corroborating witnesses flopped.\n\nThe blowback to this journalistic malpractice was so severe that the Times was forced to publish an embarrassing \u201ceditor\u2019s note\u201d admitting, \"An earlier version of this article\u2026did not include one element of the book's account\u2026 that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the severe drubbing handed out \u2013 even from some voices on the left \u2013 the Times was back at it the very next day, publishing a page one story with the headline \u201cAllegation Reopens the Debate over Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nStrike another blow against the Times\u2019 shrunken credibility. It is only the latest in a string of almost incredible lapses in journalistic integrity. Indeed, coupling those words with today\u2019s Times seems utterly inappropriate.\n\nRemember that critics recently blasted Executive Editor Dean Baquet for changing a page one headline, \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs. Racism,\u201d because it was too favorable to the president. In subsequent editions, the headline read \u201cAssailing Hate but Not Guns,\u201d which apparently mollified angry anti-Trumpers.\n\nBaquet took the opportunity presented by the demotion of an editor not in lockstep with the Times\u2019 prevailing political correctness to host a newsroom briefing this past August.\n\nAt that gathering, he explained how reporters could portray the president as a racist without actually defining him as such. This was the version of that staff gathering that was reported by the paper itself. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/business/media/times-editor-weisman-demoted.html\n\nA transcript of Baquet\u2019s remarks reveals him advising reporters that since Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s supposed collusion with Russia was a bust, the paper would now shift focus. He acknowledged that the Times was so dug in on Russiagate that they were slow to move on. \u201cWe're a little tiny bit flat-footed. I mean, that's what happens when a story looks a certain way for two years. Right?\"\n\nNo, that\u2019s actually what happens when you cling desperately to a conspiracy story about a political opponent instead of following the facts.\n\nBaquet then suggested the paper would next focus on \u201cthe country, race, and other divisions.\" That is the new mandate.\n\nUsing the newsroom as a political weapon is not only offensive to fair-minded Americans, it is also contrary to the supposed good intentions of Mr. Sulzberger.\n\nAs he took over as publisher, Sulzberger was reacting to the realization that the Times had gotten two of the most important news stories of our time dead wrong \u2013 the election of Donald Trump and the UK vote in favor of Brexit. In both cases, the smug ideological preconceptions of the Times\u2019 staff overrode any consideration for, or awareness of, opposing views.\n\nIt is fair to say that to this day the Times\u2019 staff cannot comprehend why anyone voted for Donald Trump or why any Englishman might choose to leave the EU.\n\nSo egregious was the error on the 2016 election that the former publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, felt compelled to write an apologia about his newspaper giving Hillary Clinton 85 percent odds of winning on the eve of the vote. He wondered whether \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality [had] lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSadly, no one at the Times, including Sulzberger, paid any attention to previous public editors who raised alarms about the paper\u2019s bias.\n\nThe most recent was Liz Spayd, a former managing editor for the Washington Post, who, in 2016, attempted to respond to letters from readers like this: \u201cThe NY Times is alienating its independent and open-minded readers, and in doing so, limiting the reach of their message and its possible influence.\u201d And this: \u201cYou\u2019ve lost a subscriber because of your relentless bias against Trump \u2014 and I\u2019m not even a Republican.\u201d\n\nWorried about mounting complaints, she undertook to find out \u201cWhy Readers See the Times as Liberal.\u201d\n\nShe toured the Times\u2019 newsroom asking about bias and was shocked to discover that Baquet, among others, \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe that the coverage on most days has a liberal cast\u2026\u201d Spayd wrote that \u201cthis perception [of bias] by many readers strikes me as poison. A paper whose journalism appeals to only half the country has a dangerously severed public mission.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpayd left her post early just before the public editor position was eliminated. She would likely have been dismayed to see that, thanks to the Times\u2019 venomous reporting, the paper\u2019s subscription base would swell with anti-Trump readers. Now the paper has to feed that mob.\n\nAs a result, do not look for Sulzberger to push for moderation, or balance, or fairness.
