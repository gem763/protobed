five-time world champion with a 96-point lead, a lead which equates to four victories, you are not losing any sleep,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"We are all angry. When we got together with the drivers and the engineers, there is a feeling that we got it wrong this weekend, but it doesn't mean it will have a long-term effect.\n\n\"Obviously, with the expectations we set ourselves, fourth and fifth is disappointing. The mood is one of annoyance and there isn't a single person in the team who doesn't have this feeling.\"\n\nVettel ended his 392-day wait for a race victory to deny Leclerc a third win in as many races, but the German's triumph arrived with some fortune.\n\nVettel was called in for tyres one lap earlier than Leclerc as Ferrari attempted to keep the 32-year-old ahead of Verstappen.\n\nVettel, however, took advantage of the fresh rubber, not only to keep Verstappen at bay, but to leapfrog Leclerc, too, much to the annoyance of the young Monegasque, who moaned that Ferrari's strategy was not fair.\n\n\"Two alphas competing for position has the potential for a rivalry and escalation within the team,\" added Wolff, who oversaw Hamilton's bitter relationship with former team-mate Nico Rosberg.\n\n\"We have been there before, but today, as a team, we are very strong with a clear philosophy. The positive is that they [the Ferrari drivers] keep taking points off each other, which is an advantage for us.\"", "description": "Lewis Hamilton will not be \"losing any sleep\" over his failure to win in Singapore, the Briton's team boss Toto Wolff has claimed.
