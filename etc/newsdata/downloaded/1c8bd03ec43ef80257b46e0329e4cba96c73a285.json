While the central bank was on a steady march to raise rates just a year ago, it has spent the past several months trying to insulate the American economy against those threats and keep a record expansion humming.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials signaled that they would pause to assess incoming data before they considered lowering borrowing costs again, in part because of a potential easing of trade tensions.\n\nThe Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said that while \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of risk left,\u201d there are signs that some challenges are subsiding, including the possibility of a limited trade deal between the United States and China and a negotiated exit for Britain from the European Union.", "description": "The quarter-point cut comes as the economy continues to show signs of slowing, but the Fed signaled that it may pause to weigh incoming data before adjusting rates again.", "authors": ["Jeanna Smialek"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/business/30dc-fed1alt/30dc-fed1alt-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
