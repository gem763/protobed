(AP) - Wisconsin lawmakers are preparing a bill that would allow college athletes to hire agents and profit from their names starting in 2023.\n\nThe bill is similar to California\u2019s Fair Pay to Play Act signed into law last month. The Wisconsin proposal would make it illegal for state universities to revoke an athlete\u2019s scholarship or eligibility for taking money through endorsements, autograph signings or social media advertising.\n\nThe bill also would ban the NCAA from penalizing schools for allowing student athletes to be compensated for use of their name, image or likeness.\n\nRepublican Rep. Dave Murphy of Greenville, who chairs the Assembly Colleges and Universities Committee, is spearheading the bill, the Wisconsin State Journal reported.\n\nMurphy wrote a letter Tuesday to UW Athletics Director Barry Alvarez, saying Wisconsin \u201ccannot afford to sit this discussion out.\u201d Alvarez has spoken out against changing student athlete compensation rules.\n\n\u201cWisconsin needs to stand up and be a leader on the right way to move forward on this issue,\u201d Murphy wrote.\n\nLawmakers in at least a dozen other states have introduced legislation similar to California\u2019s or pre-filed versions for the 2020 legislative session. The NCAA has fought for years against allowing college athletes to profit.\n\nBut the NCAA took a major step Tuesday toward allowing college athletes to cash in on their fame, voting to permit them to \u201cbenefit from the use of their name, image and likeness.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA Board of Governors directed each of the NCAA\u2019s three divisions to create the necessary new rules immediately and have them in place no later than January 2021.\n\nWisconsin state Rep. Katrina Shankland, a Democrat from Stevens Point, will likely sign on as a co-author of the bill, an aide from her office said.\n\n\u201cWisconsin\u2019s motto is \u2018Forward,\u2019 not \u2018Wait and See,\u2019\u201d Shankland said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait and see what the NCAA says. We want students to understand we support them and have a conversation about what fairness, equity and opportunity looks like not only in Wisconsin, but across the country.\u201d\n\nUW-Madison officials declined Wednesday to comment on the proposed bill because it has not been introduced.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wisconsin lawmakers are preparing a bill that would allow college athletes to hire agents and profit from their names starting in 2023.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
