I've been terminated after almost 28 years,\" Daron told Channel24. \"I am still a bit stunned. According to the station, I breached the terms of my contract.\"\n\nWoodlands Dairy on 11 October commented on Daron's termination on their Facebook page writing; \"It has come to our attention that some people believe Woodlands Dairy was instrumental in the dismissal of Mr Mann from Algoa FM.\n\n\"This is incorrect as all we did was lodge a complaint to Algoa FM regarding his comments.
