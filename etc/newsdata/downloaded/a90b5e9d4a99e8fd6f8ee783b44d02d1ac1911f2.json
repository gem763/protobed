But we cannot make it by simply talking about it. We have to go there and play the best football we can.\n\n\u201cIf we can, then we are really an uncomfortable opponent.\n\n\u201cWe are getting closer and closer and closer since I have been here, but still it did not happen.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came here and went to Old Trafford it was really difficult. Nobody expected us to win - perhaps not lose too high or maybe get a point.\n\n\u201cNow the situation has changed. We expect \u2013 whoever we are up against or wherever we go \u2013 a chance to win the game.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee to win a game you have to be in it to a point where if a situation develops and there is a winner, it is going to be us. That is what we will try to do.
