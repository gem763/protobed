the Middle East is less safe, less stable and less secure than before these conflicts began.\"\n\nHowever, the isolationist policy grates on many Republicans, whom he is depending upon to save him from a Democratic push to impeach and remove him from office over allegations that he abused his office.\n\nImmediately after the speech, powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the United States had to stay engaged.\n\nMr Graham said he agreed \"that America is not the policeman of the world.\"\n\nBut he said that US air power must \"continue to control the skies over Syria\" and the military should \"have a small - but capable - military partnership\" with the Kurds to prevent Islamic State from reemerging.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the lifting of US sanctions against Turkey and defended his abrupt pullout from Syria, saying \"let someone else fight\" over the \"blood-stained\" country. .
