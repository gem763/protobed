It used pictures taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\n\nFirst author Giulia Magnarini, a PhD student in earth sciences at University College London, said: 'Landslides on Earth, particularly those on top of glaciers, have been studied by scientists as a proxy for those on Mars because they show similarly shaped ridges and furrows, inferring that Martian landslides also depended on an icy substrate.\n\n'However, we've shown ice is not a prerequisite for such geological structures on Mars, which can form on rough, rocky surfaces.\n\n'This helps us better understand the shaping of Martian landscapes and has implications for how landslides form on other planetary bodies including Earth and the Moon.'\n\nHer international team examined cross-sections of the Martian surface in the Coprates Chasma in the Valles Marineris.\n\nThis enables them to compare the height of the ridges and width of the furrows to the thickness of the landslide deposit.\n\nThe massive canyon is so vast you could fit our own Grand Canyon into one of its side channels.\n\nFive miles deep and almost 2,000 miles long, on Earth it would stretch from Los Angeles to New York.\n\nThe structures were found to display the same ratios as those commonly seen in fluid dynamics experiments using sand.\n\nThis suggests an unstable and dry rocky base layer is as feasible as an icy one in creating the vast formations.\n\nWhere landslide deposits are thickest, ridges form 200 feet high and furrows are as wide as eight Olympic-sized swimming pools end-to-end.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) took this image from its Mars orbit mission\n\nThe structures change as deposits thin out towards the edges of the landslide. Here, ridges are shallow at 33 feet high and sit closer together.\n\nCo-author Dr Tom Mitchell, Associate Professoressor of earthquake geology and rock physics at UCL Earth Sciences, said: 'The Martian landslide we studied covers an area larger than Greater London and the structures within it are huge.\n\n'Earth might harbour comparable structures but they are harder to see and our landforms erode much faster than those on Mars due to rain.\n\n'While we aren't ruling out the presence of ice, we know ice wasn't needed to form the long run-outs we analysed on Mars.\n\n'The vibrations of rock particles initiate a convection process that caused upper denser and heavier layers of rock to fall and lighter rocks to rise - similar to what happens in your home where warmed less dense air rises above the radiator.\n\nNASA currently has a probe attempting to dig into the surface of the Red Planet to see what lies beneath its rocky surface\n\n'This mechanism drove the flow of deposits up to 40 km (25 miles) away from the mountain source and at phenomenally high speeds.'\n\nHis team includes Apollo 17 astronaut Professoressor Harrison Schmitt who walked on the Moon in December 1972 and completed geologic fieldwork while on the lunar surface.\n\nProfessor Schmitt, of the University of Wisconsin Madison, added: 'This work on Martian landslides relates to further understanding of lunar landslides such as the Light Mantle Avalanche I studied in the valley of Taurus-Littrow during Apollo 17 exploration and have continued to examine using images and data collected more recently from lunar orbit.\n\n'Flow initiation and mechanisms on the Moon may be very different from Mars; however, comparisons often help geologists to understand comparable features.\n\n'As on the Earth, the lunar meteor impact environment has modified the surface features of the Light Mantle Avalanche of the 75+ million years since it occurred.\n\n'The impact redistribution of materials in the lunar environment has modified features that ultimately may be found to resemble those documented in the Martian landslide study.\n\n'Of additional interest relative to the Light Mantle Avalanche deposit will be the forthcoming examination of a core from the upper 70 cm (2ft4in) of the deposit obtained during Apollo 17 exploration.\n\n'This previously protected core is in the process of being opened and examined by a large consortium of NASA and outside scientists.\n\n'This important study of a Martian landslide, for the time being at least, has been confined to remotely sensed information.'", "description": "Researchers from University College London studied deposits on the surface of Mars and said they were not necessarily caused by ice, which has been the long held belief.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20122764-0-image-a-6_1571907550632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
