His father, Vlad Filat, had been sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the \u201ctheft of the century\u201d.\n\nIn its forensic analysis of more than 400 global bribery, corruption and money laundering cases in 116 countries, Transparency International\u2019s At Your Service report found 582 UK firms or individuals had helped rich people bring suspect funds into the country.\n\nThe money was paid through some 17,000 shell companies, 1,455 of which were registered to at the same serviced office above a wine bar in Birmingham.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that the UK\u2019s world-class services have attracted a range of clients, including those who have money and pasts to hide,\u201d said Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK. \u201cNow, for the first time, we have shed light on who these companies are and how they have become entangled in some of the biggest corruption scandals of our time. This should act as a wake-up call for government and regulators, and deliver much-needed reforms to the UK\u2019s defences against dirty money.\u201d\n\nOne case revealed that a shell company called Airship Universal was used to buy a corporate box at Chelsea FC\u2019s Stamford Bridge for \u00a3126,000. In another case \u00a334,827 was paid to a now-defunct hovercraft company in Kent.\n\nAlmost \u00a33m was funnelled to private schools, including Charterhouse, Harrow and Lancing College. In 2010 alone Charterhouse, in Surrey, which describes itself as \u201cone of the great historic schools of England\u201d received \u00a3300,000 of funds linked to the Troika Laundromat scheme to move \u00a33.5bn out of Russia, according to the report.\n\nBritish universities, including the London School of Economics, the University of York, the University of St Andrews and University College London, were paid more than \u00a3500,000. The payments all came from shell companies with bank accounts at institutions that have since closed owing to mismanagement and money laundering failings, the report said.\n\nEarlier this year the National Crime Agency (NCA) seized \u00a325,000 of suspect cash from a niece of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, who had been studying design at the University of the Arts London. Several members of her family are subject to international sanctions. Anisseh Chawkat, whose mother is al-Assad\u2019s sister and whose father had been the head of Syria\u2019s military intelligence, was living in a \u00a360,000-a-year rented flat in Knightsbridge.\n\nIn another case, Vlad Luca Filat, the son of Vlad Filat, the former prime minister of Moldova, was studying business at City University in London. An NCA investigation found that the son\u2019s extravagant lifestyle in the city, which included a \u00a31,000-per-day Chelsea penthouse and \u00a3200,000 Bentley Bentayga, was funded by large deposits from overseas companies, including in the Cayman Islands and Turkey. Large cash sums were paid into three HSBC bank accounts, including \u00a398,000 in one three-day period. Facebook posts showed the 22-year-old drinking Dom P\u00e9rignon through a straw at beach parties in St Tropez.\n\nHow Britain can help you get away with stealing millions: a five-step guide Read more\n\nFor offspring that may not have been clever enough to get into top schools or universities on their academic merit, the researchers found that more than \u00a3300,000 was spent on \u201ceducational consultants helping to secure places at the most prestigious institutions\u201d.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nLarge fees were paid to an educational consultant from funds linked to the Troika Laundromat scheme, which helps parents gain places for their children in top private schools.\n\nDaniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International UK, said: \u201cGovernment and law enforcement agencies have made real progress in recent years to reduce the places for corrupt individuals to hide, yet our findings confirm it is still far too easy for criminals and the corrupt to seek impunity with the assistance of UK businesses.\n\n\u201cDespite the dedication of many committed professionals in the fight against corruption, there remains too much poor practice to be able to assume bad behaviour is confined to a few rotten apples. Businesses and government should redouble their efforts, through resource and will, to remove the helping hand for those who have abused positions of power and stolen from their people.\u201d", "description": "Groundbreaking analysis finds \u00a3300bn of suspect funds funnelled through the UK", "authors": ["Rupert Neate"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15bdcdf4c1646f3120852c67285afb0bfa9737bf/0_259_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=976e953dfc257da1dbb7a78714588e9c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
