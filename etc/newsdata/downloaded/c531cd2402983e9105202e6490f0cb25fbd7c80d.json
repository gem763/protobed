He is aged 68 and lives in Santa Monica, California.\n\nYou grew up in Santa Monica in the 1960s, which was surely a golden era in surfing.\n\nFrom starting high school in 1965, when we stored our boards in a locker under what is now known as Santa Monica pier, I was instantly drawn to the lifestyle. Between 1967 and 1969 I surfed the California coast and in 1970 I went to Honolua Bay on Maui and that was the first time I surfed a perfect tropical paradise wave. It changed my life. I spent my summer surfing in Lahaina, the same time Jimi Hendrix was filming Rainbow Bridge in Makawao. I bought a house on Kauai near my favourite surf spots and try to visit a couple months each year. Other than Hawaii, I\u2019ve been often to Puerto Rico and Costa Rica.\n\nHow does surfing make you feel?\n\nIt really is the ultimate escape. Being in the water with all the elements \u2013 the sun, the open water, and most of all, the unknown of how the waves would be from day to day \u2013 always felt like a Christmas morning. It was considered a new gift each day because back then, we didn\u2019t have a surf forecast to check and we had to guess the conditions based on the wind and weather. We would go and hope for the best. That element of surprise was what inspired us to go as often as possible.\n\nHave you been to Australia?\n\nOnly to Sydney for three days and I didn\u2019t get to surf. It was a dream of mine since I was a teenager to spend a few months travelling the Gold Coast to surf and camp but sadly it never materialised.\n\nLeight says eyewear should be like shoes \u2013 you wouldn't wear the same pair all the time. Shaughn and John\n\nAre you a nicer person if you've had your surfing fix?\n\nI definitely feel much calmer and I think I approach the day with a more positive attitude. Out on the water is one of the very few places I feel truly at peace; it always allows my mind to be in a creative space. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve struggled in recent years with back issues. It's actually mental torture for me not to be able to get out there more often.\n\nBig board collection? Natural or goofy footer?\n\nI am a goofy footer. I think my first board was a 9\u20196 Dewey Weber. Since then my collection has grown a little and now I have a range from 9\u2019 to 7\u20196\u201d.\n\nFavourite time to surf?\n\nIt used to be 5am, but now I prefer from 1pm to 4pm or at sunset in Hawaii. Surfing in the middle of the day is special; it feels almost decadent.\n\nAre crowds a turn-off?\n\nEverybody would say crowds are a turn-off. What I have noticed is that the number of people surfing has really jumped in the past five to 10 years.", "description": "For AFR Magazine's monthly Other Passions column about the hobbies of successful people, we speak to Mr Leight eyewear company founder Larry Leight about his love of surfing in Hawaii and California.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2199%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_372/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9ca993c2a7205dd25ee40e506947a2b4a270578e", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
