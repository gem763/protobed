Relive the amazing and inspirational day in the Motor City. Detroit Free Press, Detroit Free Press\n\nIn 42 years of marathon coverage, he\u2019s the biggest loser \u2014 by far.\n\nAnd that makes him a heckuva winner. Carlos Orosco, 43, of Zilwaukee is the Detroit marathon runner who lost the most weight that any race insider can recall, of all those who've ever completed the course, going back to the first Detroit marathon in 1978.\n\nHis photos say it all. In late 2015, Orosco weighed about 650 when he visited his doctor and, with his mother sobbing in the next chair, heard the dire prediction: He\u2019d be dead in three years. That\u2019s right about now.\n\nYet, there he was on Sunday, at the finish line of the Detroit Free Press/TCF Bank Marathon. And our biggest loser flashed a winner's smile, after running a full 26.2-mile marathon, and after losing about 475 pounds to do it.\n\nMarathoner Carlos Orosco of Saginaw, left, and Katelyn Trepkowski also of Saginaw cross the finish line during the 42nd Annual Detroit Free Press/TCF Bank Marathon in Detroit on Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.

After getting permission from curbside volunteers at a water station, Trepkowski grabbed not just one or two cups of water but an entire cooler full, then lugged it beside her queasy companion, doling him a gulp at a time because Orosco \u2014 following stomach-stapling surgery in 2016 \u2014 can ingest only small amounts of food and liquids at at time. And they slowed down to compensate, finishing together in 6:31:14.\n\n\"She had the plan. She got me through it,\" said the tearful moving-company logistics manager, clad in the running apparel of the Pure Nrgy fitness studio in Saginaw, whose husband-and-wife owners provided free gear to Orosco, when he became a regular at their center and they learned of his marathon dream.\n\nThe running companion for Carlos Orosco penned their goal pace times on her elbow, then displayed it at the finish line of Detroit's marathon on Oct. 20, 2019.

He'd been going to a clinic twice a week for wound care of his legs because they'd swelled so much that the skin cracked open and refused to heal, allowing infectious bacteria to enter. He had painful gout, high blood pressure and more.\n\nAll of that is gone. Orosco went from heavy drinking to no drinking, from three fast-food stops daily to none, and from huge meals to tiny ones of fruit, vegetables, fish and skinless chicken. He started to exercise and lost 100 pounds, building his strength and health for surgery called sleeve gastrectomy, which removed about 80% of his stomach.\n\n\"It's been a blessing. It gave me my life back,\" he said, in an interview before Sunday's race.\n\nCarlos Orosco has lost 475 pounds over the last three years and completed the 42nd Annual Detroit Free Press/TCF Bank Marathon. (Photo: Carlos Orosco)\n\nStill, getting to 'yes, I can' took more than just the operation. First, Orosco dropped from 650 to 250 over a two-year period, with moderate exercise and a strict diet.\n\n\"I felt great but I plateaued at that weight,\" he said. That's when a friend talked him into joining a fitness boot camp at Pure Nrgy, where the owners Ray and Rlwaida Bates \"literally greeted me like a son.\" He told then his goals, \"and they got me there,\" he said.\n\nHe started by running a 3.1-mile (5K) race, kept increasing the distances and joined the Saginaw Area Runners Club, soon craving the social side of running more than the foods he once ate, Orosco said.\n\nNow, having shed the equivalent of two Detroit Lions tight ends \u2014 at 238 pounds each \u2014 Orosco said his goal is just to \"keep running and stay healthy.\"", "description": "Once one of Michigan's most obese people, this man shed so much weight after changing his lifestyle, he ran the Detroit marathon.", "authors": ["Bill Laitner", "Published A.M.
