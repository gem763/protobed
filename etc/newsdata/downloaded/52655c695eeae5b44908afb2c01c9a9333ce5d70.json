(AP) - Marcus Johansson scored 1:30 into overtime, leading the Buffalo Sabres to a 5-4 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday night.\n\nJack Eichel scored twice and added two assists, and the Sabres improved to 3-0-1, the team\u2019s best start since opening the 2009-10 season 4-0-1. Rookie Victor Olofsson matched an NHL record in becoming the fourth NHL player to score first six career goals on the power play in a game Buffalo converted two of five opportunities.\n\nJeff Skinner also scored and defenseman Rasmus Dahlin had two assists, while Carter Hutton stopped 23 shots and improved to 3-0.\n\nJoel Armia scored twice and added an assist in a game the Canadiens rallied from a two-goal, third-period deficit. Jesperi Kotkaniemi and Ben Chiarot, with the tying goal with 7:06 remaining, also scored for the Canadiens (1-0-2)\n\nKeith Kincaid stopped 34 shots, including getting his right pad out to stop Skinner redirecting Johansson\u2019s pass into the crease with 2:51 remaining.\n\nThe game was decided just as Montreal\u2019s Paul Byron exited the penalty box while serving a slashing penalty.\n\nEichel\u2019s shot from the slot was blocked by Chiarot and the puck dribbled to Sabres defenseman Colin Miller in the left circle. Miller immediately slid a pass to Johansson, who swept it into the open side from the right circle.\n\nEichel scored the most impressive goal of the game in putting Buffalo ahead 3-2 late in the second period.\n\nCircling with the puck inside his zone, Eichel eluded Tomas Tatar\u2019s check at his own blue line and then built up a head of steam driving through the neutral zone. With Chiarot and Jeff Petry backing up, Eichel fired a low hard shot that sneaked in under Kincaid.\n\nMontreal was coming off a 6-5 shootout win at Toronto on Saturday in which the Canadiens rallied from a 4-1 deficit. The Habs also overcame a 2-0 deficit in a season-opening 4-3 shootout loss at Carolina last week.\n\nThe Sabres entered the game tied for league lead in converting 60% of their power-play chances (6 of 10), before Olofsson capitalized on Buffalo\u2019s first opportunity with a one-timer off Eichel\u2019s pass into the right circle to open the scoring 5:04 into the first period.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swede\u2019s power-play goal streak dates to the two he scored in two games last season.\n\nWinnipeg\u2019s Craig Norwich in 1979-80, Hartford\u2019s Sylvain Turgeon in 1983-84 and Islanders\u2019 Jeff Norton, from 1987-88 to 1989-90, also scored their first six career on the power play.\n\nNOTES: Sabres LW Conor Sheary\u2019s timetable for recovering from an upper body injury has increased to week to week from day to day after he was hurt in a 4-3 overtime loss at Columbus on Monday. \u2026 Evan Rodrigues made his season debut in place of Sheary. \u2026 Canadiens placed F Michael McCarron on waivers after sitting out each of Montreal\u2019s first two games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanadiens: Play Detroit Red Wings in home opener on Thursday night.\n\nSabres: Continue three-game homestand hosting Florida Panthers on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marcus Johansson scored 1:30 into overtime, leading the Buffalo Sabres to a 5-4 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/canadiens_sabres_hockey_11419_c0-158-2656-1706_s1770x1032.jpg?8f0fed474de2cedae79cdf4e379368fdcd7eff53", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
