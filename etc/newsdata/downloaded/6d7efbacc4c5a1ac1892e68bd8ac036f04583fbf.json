It plans to fund the whole acquisition out of cash and new debt.\n\nThe deal, set to close in the first quarter of 2020, is expected to boost Santos' earnings per share by 16% and increase its production by 25% in 2020, the company said.\n\nDARWIN STAKE SALE\n\nDarwin LNG is the second-oldest of Australia's 10 LNG plants.\n\nIn a move to better align ownership of Darwin LNG and the fields that feed it, Santos said it is looking to cut its stakes overall to about 40%-50%, down from 68.4% stake in Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan and 62.5% in Barossa following the acquisition.\n\nIt is already in talks with other Darwin LNG partners, which include Japan's Inpex Corp (T: ), Italy's Eni SpA (MI: ), Japan's JERA (T: ) (T: ) and Tokyo Gas (T: ), to sell equity in Barossa and Darwin LNG.\n\nIt said its Barossa partner, SK E&S of South Korea, has signed a letter of intent to buy a 25% stake in Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan.\n\nAt the same time, Santos said it is aiming to line up contracts for 60%-80% of LNG volumes for more than 10 years before taking a final investment decision on Barossa -- the first time it has publicly spelled out a target for contracts.\n\n\"Discussions to date have demonstrated strong interest in Barossa LNG, given it is a brownfield upstream development allocated close to North Asian demand,\" Gallagher said.\n\nDarwin LNG is one of several LNG projects around the world vying to line up buyers ahead of final investment decisions.", "description": "ConocoPhillips sells northern Australia assets to Santos for $1.39 billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0P7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
