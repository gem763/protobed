They reflect the firm will of our government and the strong commitment of each of us in favour of a socially more just and equitable Chile.\"\n\nBut the cabinet changes fell flat as new protests erupted after the announcement.\n\nWhat started as a demonstration against a four percent increase in Santiago's metro fare earlier this month has evolved into a wider dissent against decades of growing inequality.\n\nMany protesters say they are angry with the \"neoliberalism\" that has led to poor public services, including the almost complete privatisation of pensions, health and education.\n\nCall for new constitution\n\nOthers are demanding a new constitution, which remains as a hangover of the Pinochet regime.\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police during protests on Tuesday in capital Santiago [Pedro Ugarte/AFP]\n\n\"A new constitution is the only way. All the past governments couldn't change the constitution, and this is what we need. The Chileans are clear,\" Patricia, a 62-year-old protester in Santiago, told Al Jazeera, adding she struggled to survive on her stagnant salary.\n\n\"The repression has to change because this social movement isn't going to stop.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a peaceful march formed in Santiago's Plaza Italia, while vandalism and looting took place elsewhere in the city.\n\nArmed police fired water cannon at protesters gathered along the Alameda, the main highway leading towards the presidential palace.\n\nOne staff member of the national human rights institute, the INDH, was wounded by armed forces during the clashes.\n\nThe incident took place following the arrival of rights watchdog Amnesty International to investigate allegations of human rights violations against the demonstrators. The UN Human Rights Commission will also send a team to Chile this week.\n\n\"Even though the eyes are on Chile, the president hasn't stopped the repression on the streets, and mobilisation continues to be massive,\" Amnesty's America's director Erika Guevara told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The demonstrators are not seeing genuine commitment from the government to really address their demands.\"\n\nAllegations of rights abuses\n\nAt least 20 people have died since the unrest began.\n\nCurrently, 3,712 are detained and the INDH has filed 138 judicial cases of alleged violence, including sexual harassment and other forms of abuse.\n\nPinera has pledged full transparency in the investigations, and lifted the state of emergency that granted the state special powers to control the right to assembly and movement.\n\n\"It's quite clear there have been instances of human rights violations - if the reports are true about the nature of the injuries, and the video evidence,\" said Saladin D Meckled-Garcia, senior lecturer in the department of political science at University College London.\n\n\"People are unhappy and an authoritarian government that seems to respond with violence isn't going to solve it.\"\n\nOpposition parties are reportedly working on a proposal to change the constitution, and are expected to present on Wednesday a case against Chadwick, the former minister of the interior.", "description": "Smoke blankets the capital Santiago as fiery protests rage while thousands also hit the streets of other major cities.", "authors": ["Naomi Larsson"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/5a1e4dd7434942a0af09e5b54f29ea31_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
