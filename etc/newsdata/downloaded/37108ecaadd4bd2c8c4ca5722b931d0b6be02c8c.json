The WTO will rule on a separate EU case against U.S. subsidies to Boeing, also previously deemed illegal, in the first half of next year, determining the value of U.S. exports the EU will be permitted to hit with tariffs.\n\nThe ruling sets up a collision between allies that have long resolved most disagreements without resorting to duties. EU officials in Brussels have proposed negotiating a settlement to avoid tit-for-tat tariffs, but U.S. officials say Europe must first comply with WTO rulings. The standoff risks escalating trade tensions at a critical time.\n\nPresident Trump is poised to decide by Nov. 13 whether to levy tariffs on EU cars and auto parts, raising the threat of a rapid escalation of trans-Atlantic duties on goods worth some $100 billion. Leaders of a new EU administration, slated to take office Nov. 1, have urged Mr. Trump to avoid a trade war.\n\nWrite to Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 10:19 ET (14:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
