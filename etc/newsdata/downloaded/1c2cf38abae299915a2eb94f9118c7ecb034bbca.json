For example, Harris\u2019 campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn\u2019t be limited to immediate family \u2014 workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and \u201cchosen family,\u201d among others.\n\nPaid leave would be available to all types of workers under Harris\u2019 plan, including \u201cself-employed workers\u201d and independent contractors (though she doesn\u2019t fully explain how that would work). Workers could also break up their leave, taking portions of it intermittently.\n\nIn addition, Harris said she would push for passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act to cap the percentage of income that low- and middle-income families spend on child care.\n\nHarris also said she would create a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term, in addition to expanding food stamps and tax credits for families with children.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nMost of Harris\u2019 plan relies on approval from Congress \u2014 a hard sell, to say the least.\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.) have tried for years to drum up support for the FAMILY Act, which would provide three months of paid leave, but haven\u2019t had much luck. Democratic gains in Congress would increase Harris\u2019 chances of passing her plan, but even that wouldn\u2019t be a sure bet. DeLauro\u2019s bill, for instance, has sat untouched in the Ways and Means Committee since it was introduced in February.\n\nHarris\u2019 paid leave plan would be funded by new payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified \u201cgeneral revenues.\u201d The federal government\u2019s portion would be funded through fines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps. Harris estimates the fines would total $180 billion in the first decade and diminish over time. It would also be funded through tax increases on large corporations.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/35/24c3233149d5bc7b97753eb1b281/191007-kamala-harris-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
