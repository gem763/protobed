They also weigh less, so they can be more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.\n\nA nonprofit group called Healthy Babies Bright Futures (HBBF), which aims to reduce babies\u2019 exposure to toxic chemicals, recently tested nearly 170 baby foods for heavy metals like lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury. In a report published October 17, the group wrote that 95% of the samples analyzed contained such metals, and a quarter of the baby foods tested contained all four of those chemicals.\n\nIn high enough concentrations, these chemicals could have damaging effects on a child\u2019s brain development \u2013 including their IQ.\n\nHowever, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn\u2019t established safety limits for a number of common baby foods known to carry heavy metals, including infant formula, cereal, and canned fruits and veggies. Even when safety limits do exist, environmental groups have still found chemical concentrations that exceed the FDA threshold.\n\nThe report found high levels of arsenic in rice-based cereals\n\nThe tests were conducted from 2014 to 2017, across 14 metropolitan areas in the US. The food items came from more than 60 brands and 17 different retailers, including supermarkets and dollar stores.\n\nOf all the baby foods analyzed, rice-based foods were found to have the highest concentrations of heavy metals. Among these foods, the report identified arsenic as the \u201cprimary toxic metal of concern,\u201d and rice-based cereals as \u201cthe top source of arsenic in infants\u2019 diets.\u201d\n\nArsenic forms naturally in the Earth\u2019s crust. Exposure to the compound has been linked to brain-development issues in children, including slower motor function, diminished memory, and decreased IQs. It can also lead to birth defects and an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nsource ElRoi/Shutterstock\n\nThe FDA has an established safety limit for inorganic arsenic \u2013 the kind that\u2019s most toxic to humans \u2013 in infant rice cereal: 100 parts per billion. That\u2019s the equivalent of about a teaspoon of the chemical in a swimming pool. But the HBBF study found that four of the cereals they tested \u2013 two samples of Whole Grain Rice Cereal from Earth\u2019s Best, one sample of Organic Brown Rice Cereal from Healthy Times, and one sample of Brown Rice Organic Sprouted Whole Grain Baby Cereal from BioKinetics \u2013 exceeded the FDA threshold.\n\nRead more: Breast milk could carry harmful chemicals like flame retardants and BPA, but breastfeeding is still the healthiest food source for babies\n\nSome of the rice cereals sampled in the HBBF report also contained lead, a heavy metal to which there is no safe level of exposure. Children exposed to lead can suffer permanent brain damage that can result in learning disabilities and violent behavior.\n\nHealthy Times and BioKinetics did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the findings of the recent report. In a statement to Business Insider, a representative of Earth\u2019s Best said the company is working with the Baby Food Council to reduce heavy metals across the industry.\n\n\u201cOur number-one priority has always been the safety of our food, and we assure you our products are safe and compliant with all FDA regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs parents, we too share your concern for the safety and health of children.\u201d\n\nHeavy metals in food can lead to a decrease in children\u2019s IQ\n\nThe report estimated that US newborns and children up to 2 years old lose more than 11 million IQ points over their lifetime due to exposure to arsenic and lead in food. Those calculations were based on a combination of data about the average baby\u2019s diet from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and FDA data about the concentrations of lead and arsenic in food.\n\nMore than half of this IQ loss can be attributed to just 15 foods, the authors wrote, and around 20% comes from rice-based foods. Infant rice cereal alone contributed nearly 3% to the total IQ loss, or around 330,000 IQ points over a lifetime, according to the report.\n\nThose findings have caught the attention of Sen. Chuck Schumer, who on Sunday directed the FDA to examine the HBBF report and release its conclusions to the public.\n\n\u201cThe report is very, very troubling,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cParents across the land should worry about teaching their children the ABCs, not worry about what\u2019s in their baby\u2019s food.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Rice-based cereals showed the highest concentrations of heavy metals, with arsenic identified the \"primary toxic metal of concern.\".
