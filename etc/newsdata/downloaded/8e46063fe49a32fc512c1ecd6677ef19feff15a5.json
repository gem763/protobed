We pulled up next to them on the return trip.\n\nAs I sidled up to them, I made what I thought were comforting horsey clicking noises but they remained suspicious of me and wouldn\u2019t let me get close. So I gently tossed an apple towards them. They started and bolted off to a safer distance from me. I begged them out loud to believe I was helping them, but as I showed them the other apples, throwing them a little harder and closer to where they were, they galloped further away. I was gutted.\n\nI left the apples and hoped they\u2019d return sometime.\n\nThe plight of those donkeys keeps niggling at me.\n\nI\u2019ve recently returned from a road trip through the Eastern, Western and a bit of the Northern Cape and the Free State.\n\nThe journey was sobering in many respects as we saw the marked decline in the small towns, provoked by the catastrophic drought there.\n\nWe\u2019ve all read about the drought and the desperate situations of the farmers and townsfolk there, but it was only after seeing it for myself that I realised how dire it is.\n\nPicture this. The veld is scorched. Dust is kicked up in huge clouds all over by the dry Karoo gales raging across the veld. The fine red dust clings to your skin, lips, hair and clothes. When you blow your nose you realise there\u2019s dust in your breathing tubes. Your nose bleeds at times.\n\nIt\u2019s that bad.\n\nWe saw no streams or rivers running. The watering holes and farm dams are dry. The Karoo bushes are mostly dead. The hardy thorn trees lie broken. The landscape is 50 shades of brown, red and grey. The Karoo \u201cbossies\u201d we saw flowering in a rainbow of hues on a similar trip a few years ago at the same time, were gone. It\u2019s devastating to see and hard to imagine a recovery anytime soon.\n\nThis drought has done years and years of damage. The veld is like a desert. We saw virtually no insects and far fewer tortoises and buck. Farms have been overgrazed and there\u2019s nothing left.\n\nWe saw little towns where desperate-looking locals sat around doing nothing all day, their dignity shot to hell. They\u2019ve lost their jobs on the farms and in the businesses that service them.\n\nThe local shops have scant supplies. People aren\u2019t buying so the shops can\u2019t stock up. Everywhere we went people were talking about the drought. There\u2019s an air of deep depression in places. Farmers have cut drastically the numbers of their stock. Even the hardy angora goats are struggling.\n\nI spoke to a man in Beaufort West and asked him how the community was coping with the effects of the drought and their empty town dam. \u201cWe just keep hoping for rain. If we give up hope, we\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d\n\nAmid the devastation and despair of local people, some of whom justifiably feel let down by the authorities, there is one man whose name is held up like a beacon of hope.\n\nDr Imtiaz Sooliman of the international aid organisation Gift of the Givers, is widely seen to be someone who cares about the forgotten towns of the Karoo.\n\nHe\u2019s gone in with specialists to bore down to find the cool reserves of underground aquifers to pump water to those who need it.\n\nHe\u2019s gone in with trucks full of fodder, water tanks and supplies \u2014 we saw them on the road \u2014 to help stricken farmers and locals. He\u2019s co-ordinating life-giving relief.\n\n\u201cPrayer and a unified approach with government, the private sector, farming communities and the public at large is the only realistic way to deal with the unprecedented challenges of a drought that has wreaked untold devastation on man, animal, environment and the economy,\u201d said Sooliman.\n\nIndeed, many of the locals are praying hard.\n\nWhile having coffee at a place in Ladi\u00adsmith in the Klein Karoo, we heard the familiar sound of church bells tolling the hour at noon, as all Karoo townsfolk hear all day (and night!).\n\nBut this time the clock carried on chiming. I counted up to 52 chimes then gave up.\n\nHas the church clock fried in this 41\u00b0 Celsius heat, we wondered?\n\nNo, the caf\u00e9 owner told us. It was the daily reminder to townsfolk to pray for rain. Even I bowed my head.\n\nCall it prayer, call it doing anything so you feel like you\u2019ve done something. In the face of this wide-scale catastrophe, and the lingering thought of \u201cmy\u201d stricken donkeys, it was the only thing I could do in that moment.\n\nGift of the Givers\u2019 Dr Imtiaz Sooliman calls for urgent support from all\n\nHe\u2019s a really busy man. But by his own admission, he thrives on the adrenaline of it all. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman is all smiles and welcoming when he shows me into his office in Prince Alfred Street, the nerve centre of all the aid work GoG does, locally, nationally and internationally. And things are frenetic right now.\n\nRecently, the Gift of the Givers delivered eight truckloads of fodder to Graaff-Reinet. In a statement about the mercy dash to help farmers, Sooliman said the request for fodder among emerging and commercial farmers was \u201coverwhelming, [there\u2019s] desperation in their eyes, a deep compassion to feed hungry and dying animals\u201d.\n\nDr Imtiaz Sooliman\n\nSooliman says the fodder delivery was led by Hester Obermeyer and Sybil Visagie, their two \u201coutstanding co-ordinators that have relentlessly sourced and delivered fodder to countless communities in Northern, Eastern, Western Cape and now KZN\u201d.\n\nDr Gideon Groenewald, Gift of the Givers hydrologist, was due to be on site to witness the drilling of the eight boreholes in the town. Sooliman says the first five boreholes yielded 102 000 litres per day, collectively, and they were taking bottled water, water tankers and two truckloads of water from Gift of the Givers\u2019 Makhanda depot. They\u2019ve also donated nutritional supplies for children.\n\nI ask him about the scale of the water crisis in the Cape and elsewhere in South Africa. He says their drought intervention started in 2015 in the North West and the Free State. \u201cThe 2017 Knysna fire was so big because of drought. Everything was dry and there was not enough water to fight fire.\n\n\u201cThen Sutherland called for help with fodder. Their animals were dying. The list of places we\u2019re helping at has gone through the roof \u2014 the North West, Eastern Cape, Southern Cape and now KZN. We\u2019ve drilled 230 boreholes in the last year, yielding 85 million litres a day.\n\n\u201cThe sheep count was 440 000 a few years ago; it\u2019s now 40 000.\u201d\n\nSooliman says during Cape Town\u2019s 2018 day-zero crisis they shifted massive amounts of water from Durban and Joburg to Cape Town. \u201cWhile we were putting in boreholes in Beaufort West and Touws Rivier, we got calls from Makhanda in February and then Aberdeen.\n\n\u201cFodder is one aspect and water requirements were increasing. Then we got calls from Adelaide. Adelaide was collapsing. The dam was at zero. We were still working at Makhanda.\n\n\u201cThen the calls came. The Graaff-Reinet dam is at zero. The boreholes are non-functional. The water pressure can\u2019t reach disadvantaged communities. Clinics don\u2019t have water, patients can\u2019t take meds, kids are thirsty. Schools don\u2019t have water for ablutions. It\u2019s a knock-on effect. There\u2019s the emotional aspect, psychological and medical aspects. The feeding scheme was collapsing. People can\u2019t cook, the sanitation is affected.\n\n\u201cIn Adelaide, my team heard a sound. When they went to look for that sound they found a lamb. A sheep had given birth and had left its lamb alone. Sheep don\u2019t just do that. It didn\u2019t have the energy to feed its newborn so it just walked away. Then we found three more. It\u2019s happening all over. It\u2019s terrible. Cattle are dropping dead everywhere, even when they are walking in town in search of food.\u201d\n\nBut amid the stories of despair, came hope. \u201cWe had an amazing reaction in Adelaide. When they opened the water tank for the first time and as the water started trickling in, it started making a sound and animals started running towards the water tanker.\u201d\n\nDr Imtiaz Sooliman (left) and Dr Gideon Groenewald take a sip of fresh water from a borehole in Beaufort West. (PHOTO: CITY PRESS)\n\nSooliman says because the farms were suffering losses as animals died, the farm workers started losing their jobs.\n\n\u201cEach worker supports seven people. A town like Fraserburg was ready to shut down. The economy died. All the banks closed. The rural towns are economically finished because the farmers\u2019 \u2014 who are the money spinners \u2014 export earnings have been hit. Animals are dying so farmers can\u2019t sell them, and there\u2019s foreclosure from the banks\n\n\u201cPeople who have had farms for years and years are losing their farms. People are depressed. Today I spoke to a guy delivering fodder, who said that for the first time in their lives Afrikaner farmers are asking for food parcels for themselves. They can\u2019t send their kids to school, they don\u2019t have the money. Their accounts are maxed out at the co-op, at the bank their credit cards, everything. Quite a few have committed suicide.\n\nAMANZI!\n\nI tell him that on my recent trip people spoke highly of him and Gift of the Givers. He smiles.\n\n\u201cIn Queenstown we went in with our truck. We didn\u2019t say water was coming. They just saw the name Gift of the Givers. As soon as they saw it, the people started shouting \u2018Amanzi!\u2019. There were old people running down from the mountains to collect water.\n\n\u201cSome guy called me on Monday and said I\u2019ll give you 40 trucks of fodder. Everyone wants to be part of us. We\u2019re pushing in bottled water, water tankers, fodder, and drilling boreholes. I\u2019ve spent R230 million on drought relief so far.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S GOVERNMENT DOING?\n\nAt last, the government is taking notice of the work Sooliman and his teams are doing. \u201cLindiwe Sisulu (Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation) has approached us to appoint us as a rapid response team to the department. She phones three times a week and speaks for nothing under 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nHe says she has asked for time to sort things out in her department and has pledged to make money available from Treasury. \u201cShe\u2019s cancelled tenders from municipalities. She pulled back over R600 million. She said this money\u2019s wasted and people are getting rich while people who need delivery don\u2019t get it. She went to Tito [Mboweni \u2014 minister of Finance] directly.\u201d\n\nTreasury said they can appoint Gift of the Givers in terms of disaster management. \u201cWe can see they are serious. She calls to ask everyday if the money has come. So far it hasn\u2019t. People think we got paid, but we still haven\u2019t got paid. We still haven\u2019t got paid at Makhanda, but the good thing is that the crooks didn\u2019t get the money!\u201d He laughs and I join in. There is some comfort in that.\n\n\u201cWe spent R17 million in Grahamstown and they wanted to give us R2,4 million. I said it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t need your money, I\u2019m doing this for the people.\u201d\n\nPLEASE AND THANK YOU\n\nHow can South Africa help?\n\n\u201cI really need the corporates to come on board in a big way. Yes, government makes money available but the reality is that government can\u2019t manage this problem. It\u2019s too big. You have to have support. And a special thanks to all those farmers who have generously donated fodder, because they don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll need it. But they\u2019re sending it still in big loads, so there\u2019s also a massive need for fuel to pay for the trucks to take it. We also really need horse and trailers.\u201d\n\nHe asks that government, corporates, high net-worth individuals, the public, the media and crowd-funding platforms intervene urgently to save what\u2019s left and turn the situation around. \u201cWe need to hold hands together to lift our people in a dignified manner for our collective prosperity.\u201d\n\nWHAT DOES A BOREHOLE COST?\n\nA borehole costs between R100 000 and R500 000, depending on how deep it needs to go, the rock it must go through, the type of drill bits needed, piping, electricity or solar power needed, if you\u2019re using diesel, and long it takes.\n\n\u201cBut in 2015 the one in QwaQwa cost me R700 000. The Grahamstown borehole \u2014 the one we put up at the school and never got paid for \u2014 is now supporting Grahamstown, Adelaide, Bedford, Queenstown, King William\u2019s Town, and Graaff-Reinet. Not all on the same day, but it can provide a million litres a day. On top of sinking boreholes, we put in filtration systems and chemicals. Everywhere we went, people said you won\u2019t find water. We found water in three hours.\u201d\n\nWhile talking to me, Sooliman is checking his phone because he\u2019s part of efforts to rescue South Africans trapped in Syria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing big interventions this week. We\u2019ll be drilling in Qwa-Qwa. There\u2019s a big water crisis there. The main source of water in Qwa-Qwa is our borehole we put in four years ago.\u201d\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nHe sings his praise for his team. His eyes shine as he speaks of their achievements to help people. When he speaks about the hydrologist who works with him, Dr Gideon Groenewald, his eyes dance. \u201cHe is the genius, he\u2019s the fundi. I don\u2019t think anyone in SA can touch this guy.\u201d\n\nSooliman says Groenewald has pinpoint accuracy for finding water.\n\n\u201cHe went to Cradock, a farmer was crying. He said his great-great grandfather farmed here, his great-grandfather, grandfather and father and now he\u2019s going to lose this farm. Groenewald looked at his map, did his prayer and the next morning, boom! Thirty metres in front of the guy\u2019s roof. The man\u2019s a genius!\n\n\u201cAt Adelaide they drilled 1 000 metres down, they couldn\u2019t find water. This man came and found it in a few hours. At Makhanda they said, old man you won\u2019t find water here. The same story at Adelaide, and Graaff-Reinet.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE CATCH?\n\n\u201cAt Sutherland, the guys were sceptical. We\u2019re a Muslim organisation and some of the guys there are Afrikaner conservatives. They said why are those guys coming here. We said one sheep and a thousand rand was all we need [to provide water]. It wouldn\u2019t cover the costs.\u201d\n\nHis co-ordinators on the ground in Sutherland told him that some of the farmers were saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d.\n\n\u201cDoc, they said, it\u2019s so funny. They were asking are we going to put a mosque here? Are we going to convert them, are we going to take their land? One month has gone, two, three. They\u2019re waiting for the catch. What is the bloody catch?\u201d (Sooliman laughs as he tells this story.)\n\n\u201cTwo years later they realise there\u2019s no catch and now they just love us there. In Adelaide, when a farmer started praying, he said: \u2018God, thank you for the drought.\u2019 The guys asked why. He said \u2018this drought has united us. We don\u2019t see colour, we don\u2019t see race, we don\u2019t see religion anymore. It has educated us. Our whole perspective in life has changed.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing things for the emerging farmers. They\u2019re taking fodder to them. They\u2019re working together as one.\u201d\n\nFaith and local knowledge help Oom Gideon find the water\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pray for rain. I pray for the wisdom to find the water.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Dr Gideon Groene- wald told me when I called him last week. He\u2019s the man who has gained recognition for his uncanny ability to find water where no one else can in the drought-ravaged areas around our country.\n\nThe drought, and the massive humanitarian crisis caused by it, is far from over, he said, and an unexpected consequence of this for the general public may be that we go back to eating sorghum products like Maltabella instead of mielie meal.\n\nThe sobering news is that the life-giving pockets of water he manages to find, stored in precious aquifers underground, are running out. Fast.\n\nThe Gift of the Givers\u2019 hydrologist earnestly asked me to call him Oom Gideon instead of Dr Groenewald when I called him on Friday.\n\nHe said we\u2019re lucky to have excellent primary aquifers in our country (loose sand, gravels and weathered rocks into which water seeps when it rains) which hold the best ground water. He added that dolomite chambers which also hold water underground are the country\u2019s saving grace but they\u2019re being used up by farmers irrigating maize.\n\nHe\u2019s not a fan of this. \u201cMaize uses five times the amount of water than sorghum does. We\u2019re using the wrong plant to make food in the desert, but we have three generations of people who say they would rather eat mieliepap than Maltabella. In 1981, we were all having to eat yellow mielie meal because the white mielie meal ran out. There will have to be a return to historic foods.\u201d\n\nGroenewald believes that the drought still has two more years to play out and that the country would take some seven years from then to recover from its effects.\n\n\u201cThere is a change in the global climate. We\u2019ll see the Earth warm up and in 20 to 30 years, sea levels will rise 12 metres. People will have to move away from the coast.\u201d\n\nGroenewald said the pattern of places experiencing either flooding or very dry weather is typical for a global warming period and that the intense cyclones and hurricanes around the world suck the moisture from the atmosphere, leaving dry air in its place. He believes that weather phenomenon of extreme heat followed by extreme cold will also intensify, as indicated by research of historical data. He told the story of a mammoth that was found in Siberia frozen solid with green grass in its mouth, indicating a drop in temperature from 30\u00b0 Celsius to -53\u00b0 in just four hours. He said the great variations we are seeing in temperatures, where the maximum temperature is 38\u00b0 C one day and 12\u00b0 C the next, will intensify because of global warming.\n\nSo the question Groenewald is asked the most comes up: How does he find the water?\n\nHe has unconventional methods, seemingly combining science and his deep Christian faith.\n\n\u201cI wake up at 1 am and block out the area I want to concentrate on using a satellite image. I go 78 kilometres above the area (on the image) and use my knowledge of the Karoo to find the places water may be.\u201d\n\nAnd he has extensive knowledge of the geology of the Karoo. He has spent much time examining the Karoo ground and rocks, mapping it out at 10 cm levels to research and write into history what the climate patterns have been.\n\nHe examines the plants along the cracks that form where the rock that is conducive to storing water runs.\n\nHe also uses the ancient knowledge of the local people who name plants and rivers using words that translate into, for example, a river called \u201clots of water\u201d, or \u201cdon\u2019t rely on me\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe language of Africa contains survival information. If you don\u2019t speak the languages, you won\u2019t know,\u201d said Groenewald.\n\nThen, from 1 am to 4 am, Groenewald meditates and prays. \u201cGod created the Earth and is in control of it \u2014 global warming and drought too. He reveals the water to me during prayer.\u201d But after 4 am, the gift is gone. \u201cI no longer see where it is.\u201d\n\nGroenewald said he then maps the lines revealed to him at this time and uses science on the ground with the help of a magnetometer to help direct where the boreholes must go.\n\nAnd indeed, he seems to hit his target with great accuracy.\n\nBut while he can find the water, it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t run out. \u201cThe water levels are dropping underground at a dramatic pace. We see how the roots of the trees can\u2019t reach down to the water and the trees just die. The severity of the drought is wide-reaching. From Victoria Falls to the Tugela River, the Orange River; big rivers are going.\u201d\n\nHe said that when the rain comes, indications are that it could be patchy and localised to smaller areas of around four to five square kilometres.\n\n\u201cIf God doesn\u2019t intervene at the Katze Dam [only 13,6% full on October 21], by December there will be wars fought over water in South Africa. People need water, and they will find it and take it.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural disaster which is getting worse on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nGift of the Givers pledged to give school pupils in drought-affected areas 10 litres of water a day. Groenewald said they are now supplying this amount to 7 000 children.\n\nAsked how it makes him feel when the borehole that he directed the drilling of, strikes water, he drew a deep breath in, and said: \u201cThe drought is like when someone has died. That feeling when the water is there is like if God had revived them. I know a child will be living tomorrow because of it. Jesus Christ said I will be the living water of the human spirit.\u201d\n\nHe said working with Gift of the Givers has deepened his understanding of the Muslim faith.\n\nGroenewald said the effects of the drought on the veld are going to be seen for years and years to come. Infrared imaging shows that the plants in drought-stricken areas are in a dormant phase, something they can take seven years to recover from fully, from when it rains. \u201cThey\u2019re in hibernation, like the reptiles.\u201d\n\nHe also believes that the strife in some circles in the country has been because people are living in tension because of the drought, and have a deep underlying concern about there being enough water in our future.", "description": "The week before last, I found myself at the side of a seldom-used road in the middle of the dead-dry Karoo, trying to tempt two skinny looking donkeys to eat the apples I held for them with outstretched arms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7997/30e34d72f0574cef991a46159d456b2f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
