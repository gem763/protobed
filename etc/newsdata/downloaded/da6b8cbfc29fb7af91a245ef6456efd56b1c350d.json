Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily. https://t.co/mHfFC8HluZ \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 23, 2019\n\nSo what\u2019s different this time? We posit a few theories.\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re more culturally aware now: From widespread police shootings of black people, to the #MeToo movement, to some presidential candidates talking about reparations for slavery. There were race riots in the \u201990s that captured the nation\u2019s attention, but the United States feels like it\u2019s at a more reflective moment today over race, gender and how minorities are treated.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele has been out front in criticizing Trump for this, tweeting a photo of a lynching. In an interview with The Fix, he stressed that this type of language is never okay in political terms -- it\u2019s equivalent to Nazi references, he said -- but agreed that context matters between then and now. \u201cOur attitudes and views on subject matters are more heightened today than they have may have been five years ago, and 20 years ago and definitely 50 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe media landscape is different from the \u201990s: Cable news was just coming of age during the Clinton impeachment. There certainly weren\u2019t social media and smartphone alerts that allow news to ricochet across the globe in seconds. So more people heard about Trump\u2019s lynching comment in a smaller amount of time, allowing for more politicians to react and for the story to build up more quickly than a floor speech on the House of Representatives that few people were watching in real time.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said it: This is the big one for a few reasons. One is that Trump is president of the United States, so his words carry more weight than those of a member of Congress. He\u2019s also white, and the majority of lynching victims were black. For the most powerful (white) person in the world right now to compare his plight of an impeachment inquiry, where lawmakers are following very real evidence, to the gruesome, death-by-torture mob mentality that claimed the lives of thousands of powerless black men was especially dissonant. It was Trump\u2019s extreme victimhood on display, and it\u2019s possible he truly believes he has been wronged on a par with lynching victims, writes The Fix\u2019s Eugene Scott.\n\nBut perhaps the most notable reason Trump\u2019s lynching comments drew a major outcry was because the president no longer gets the benefit of the doubt that he is innocently using offensive language. He has a history of making racially inflammatory and even outright racist statements. Demonizing people of color and stereotyping black communities have been part of his campaign since day one. He also has a well-documented lack of empathy for people who are struggling.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just: 'Oh, a Republican said it so therefore it\u2019s 10 times worse,\u201d Steele said. \u201cNo, if anybody days it, it shows a lack of appreciation of history and a lack of sensitive to how it impacts African Americans. Now having said that, what makes it much more difficult for someone like Trump is his own history when it comes to this type of language and the attitude regarding race. And so he\u2019s given less quarter, less room to make that mistake, because his history is long and deep on the subject, going back to the Central Park Five.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYes, I said those words, but context matters,\u201d Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) told Rieger. \"There is a difference when that word is used by someone of my experience and perspective, whose relatives were the targets of lynch mobs, compared to a president who has dog-whistled to white nationalists and peddled racism,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cThis is the birther president, who called African nations s---holes and urban cities infested. Those he called \u2018very fine people\u2019 in Charlottesville were the kind of people who lynched those who looked like me. So, yes \u2014 there are certain words I am more at liberty to invoke than Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nCombine all this, and it\u2019s hard to believe that Trump did not mean to draw a direct contrast between what\u2019s happening to him now and the real lynchings of the 19th and 20th centuries. Especially when one of his top supporters in Congress, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), clarified that for Trump, this is \u201ca lynching in every sense of the word.\u201d\n\nTrump just doesn\u2019t get the credit afforded other politicians that he was using language derived from political discourse rather than deliberately invoking America\u2019s racist past.\n\nAD", "description": "For one thing, Trump doesn't get the same benefit of the doubt afforded other politicians.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iNN2k72BI9wwoin06K3R59G99OI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2TFWMTXUZ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
