Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut!\" Trump tweeted Thursday, pausing in his focus on the impeachment inquiry against him in Congress.\n\nThe European Central Bank left its policy interest rate unchanged on Thursday at -0.5 percent, while the Bank of Japan -- also set to meet next week -- has a -0.1 percent rate as sluggish economic growth persists.\n\n- Mixed economic signals -\n\nMeanwhile, official government data and industry reports are giving mixed signals about the US economy.\n\nSales of American manufactured goods had a dismal September, hit hard by Boeing's woes and a protracted work stoppage at General Motors, the Commerce Department reported.\n\nTotal new orders fell 1.1 percent in September to $248.2 billion.\n\nThe result meant 2019 so far has been a year to forget, with sales in the first nine months of the year 0.8 percent lower than the same period in 2018.\n\nThe largest part of the damage last month was done by the transportation sector, with autos and parts falling 1.6 percent and civilian aircraft falling another 11.8 percent, extending August's decline.\n\nNew home sales also declined, falling 0.7 percent but they are up 15.5 percent compared to September 2018, according to a separate report on Thursday.\n\nAmid rising wages, low interest rates and historically low unemployment, new home sales forged higher in June, July and August.\n\nBut the far larger market for existing homes also fell in September, according to industry data released earlier this week.\n\nScarce labor, high costs for materials in part due to tariffs, and fear that Trump's trade wars could scare off would-be buyers had previously made some homebuilders reluctant or unable to add to the supplies.\n\nEconomist Yelena Maleyev of GrantThornton noted home prices are rising due to high demand and low supply.\n\n\"Manufacturing counties, most of which are concentrated in the Midwest, have been hardest hit by the trade war and, more recently, the GM strike; those losses are spilling into the housing market,\" she said in an analysis.\n\n\"Housing activity is expected to contribute to overall GDP for the first time in more than a year and a half in the third quarter, but only modestly.\"\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturing, including auto building, has been in steady decline. And though it is a much smaller share of the US economy than services, it has been the sector Trump promised to help with his aggressive tariff strategy.", "description": "President Donald Trump once again attacked the US Federal Reserve on Thursday, calling for more interest rate cuts to stimulate the American economy just days before a key policy meeting.  \"The Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn't lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wfw70Jw4NwYh0mh2UYOGVg--~B/aD01MDA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/8a9164e24c9ac513e7d4852b5c5d7ae068521c26.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
