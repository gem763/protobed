(Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar did not weigh in on voting rights because they spoke before Mr. Sanders.) Here are some of the highlights for each candidate.\n\nSanders backs voting rights for Boston bomber and rapists\n\nMr. Sanders said he believed that people in jail, even \u201cterrible people\u201d like the Boston Marathon bomber and sex assault offenders, should have the right to vote, a view that is likely to draw rebukes from both Republicans and some Democrats alike.\n\n\u201cI think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy. Yes, even for terrible people,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause once you start chipping away, and you say, \u2018Well that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Well that person did that, not going to let that person vote,\u2019 you\u2019re running down a slippery slope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that people commit crimes, they pay the price,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get out of jail, I believe they certainly should have a right to vote. But I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders backed voting rights for people now in jail, including the Boston Marathon bomber, while Pete Buttigieg disagreed and Kamala Harris said, \u201cI think we should have that conversation.\u201d", "authors": ["Sydney Ember", "Astead W.
