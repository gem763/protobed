Three-star Michelin chef Arnaud Lallement invites us into the kitchen at his restaurant, L'Assiette Champenoise, to discover how he uses this unique fermented drink to complement dishes based on Brittany lobster.\n\nThis dish - which combines Brittany lobster, vegetables, seafood butter, a verveine infusion, wild almonds and a paprika-based sauce - is perfectly matched with sake chosen by the chef himself.\n\nArnaud Lallement tastes his own creation and describes it for us: \"We have kept the firm texture of the seafood, but also its depth, its iodine, which goes well with the first impression we have after taking a mouthful of the sake. After that we have the sauce which brings heat, more sake, and then the wild almond with apricot. Acidity, fruit, wild almond, it\u2019s all there in the sake\u2019s acidity. This is what remains after the last mouthful.\"", "description": "Sake is a drink that is finding increasing popularity among chefs in Europe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/12/58/44/1000x563_cmsv2_e08a512b-4e6b-5955-a806-f4e28919f7c6-4125844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
