During the meeting, Sondland\u2019s agenda for Ukraine began to become clear, when he blurted out to the other officials present that there were \u201cinvestigations that were dropped that need to be started up again,\u201d according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden \u2014 something that made Bolton go \u201cballistic\u201d after the meeting, the official said. Hill told lawmakers that after the meeting, Bolton instructed her to go raise their concerns about the shadow Ukraine operations with White House lawyers. Bolton said he didn\u2019t want to be part of any \u201cdrug deal\u201d that was being cooked up on Ukraine, one person familiar with Hill\u2019s testimony said.\n\nTo this point, we\u2019ve known that Bolton wasn\u2019t happy about his acrimonious White House exit, given his public back-and-forth with Trump over it. What we didn\u2019t know was how much his disenchantment might have extended to the Ukraine story. There are plenty of indications, after all, that Bolton was frozen out of White House processes toward the end of his tenure, as his rift with Trump grew. And reporting indicates that the Ukraine policy often went around the National Security Council, which Bolton led and Hill served on.\n\nBut Hill paints a picture of a Bolton who was in the room for at least some key Ukraine events, which would matter in any testimony he would offer.\n\nBolton\u2019s motivation is also important here. In addition to his dissatisfaction with the circumstances of his departure, he has already spoken out against some of the policies of the administration he left behind \u2014 more gently in public and in a more unvarnished manner privately.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump supporters\u2019 will cast him as a disgruntled former aide if he testifies against the White House, but it\u2019s also true that aides with more loyalty might bend their version of events in a more favorable light. Bolton appears to have no great motivation to do that, based on how he views this episode and how he exited the White House. And whatever he says, if he testifies, will be under oath.\n\nAnd last is a related point. Not only is Bolton a potentially motivated witness with little loyalty to Trump, he actually has something pulling him in the opposite direction: An almost-religious view of foreign policy. Bolton has often been criticized as strident and overly militaristic, but regardless of the substance of his foreign policy, the point here is that he has strong beliefs that appear to outrank other concerns.\n\nThat\u2019s important, especially in this moment, because Trump\u2019s foreign policy has veered significantly away from Bolton\u2019s vision \u2014 most recently with his decision to withdraw from northern Syria, which is a decision many hawkish Republicans speak about in dire terms. They speak of Trump having left the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies for \u201cslaughter\u201d at the hands of Turkey, as well as a possible resurgence of the Islamic State. And if those Republicans are speaking out against Trump like never before, just imagine what Bolton must be thinking right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the great ironies here is that Bolton is perhaps the last person you would expect to be a key witness for Democrats in their impeachment inquiry, given that they have derided him for so long. And the thing that could give him extra motivation to speak out is a shift away from Republican Party orthodoxy on foreign policy.\n\nMuch remains to play out, and Bolton still has not even been called to give a deposition. But Giuliani seems genuinely concerned that Bolton viewed his and the Trump team\u2019s Ukraine actions in such a light. And the table seems to be set for Bolton to figure prominently in whatever comes next.\n\nAD", "description": "After a Bolton adviser said he likened Rudy Giuliani to an \"hand grenade,\" Giuliani responded by calling Bolton an \"atomic bomb.\" It may be truer than he knows.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K3j9jjD_vPp9x4En7qG6oF0EE4M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4OX34PHKAUI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
