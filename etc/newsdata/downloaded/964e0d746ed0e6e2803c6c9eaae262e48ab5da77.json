Does it have anything to do with Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr., or perhaps Ivanka Trump? Tiffany, even? And I would be more than happy to take on any more information about these \u201cOval Office operations\u201d that you previously discussed. I feel that it would really help you to get some more of this stuff off of your chest right now.\n\nOr perhaps you would like to talk about the reported fact that Trump liked to call you \u201cmy beautiful beauty?\u201d Haha. Was that weird? Maybe that wasn\u2019t even remotely the weirdest thing about your job \u2014 again, please feel free to share with me any and everything about your time there. It can be an incredible source of comfort to vent to a new acquaintance, and let them write down what you said. Frankly, recording a conversation is more intimate and less distracting, so we could do that.\n\nI\u2019m available for dinner literally at any waking moment, day or night. Happy to come to you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Friend", "description": "Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant Madeline Westerhout was let go abruptly Thursday after her boss learned she had \u201cindiscreetly shared details\u201d about his family and White House operations.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/30/30-madeleine-westerhout.w1200.h630.jpg"}
