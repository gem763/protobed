Whether it\u2019s through their rapping abilities, writing chops, or ground-breaking decision-making skills behind-the-scenes, ladies have proven time and time again that hip-hop isn\u2019t just a man\u2019s game.\n\nIn recent years, a cadre of female rappers such as Tierra Whack and Rapsody have fought their way to the head of the hip-hop class, thanks to incredible projects and the skills to boot. However, despite these great strides, women are consistently left out of the conversation when it comes to ranking the best of the genre.\n\nEarlier this summer, The Brew Podcast\u2019s list of the 50 best rappers of all time created a social media furore as there were no women included. In September, Nicki Minaj\u2019s now-deleted retirement announcement was met with everything from sadness to confusion to overall apathy. Many questioned whether Minaj should be included on a list of the Top 10 rappers of all-time, which sparked debates about her discography and whether she is \u2018worthy\u2019 of such an honour. Now, BBC Music\u2019s poll of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time includes two female rappers in the top 25, but none in the top fifteen.\n\nWhy does hip-hop continue to shut them out?\n\n\u201cFemale rappers have always been part of the genre's lineage,\u201d culture critic Taylor Crumpton tells BBC Music. \u201cYet due to power dynamics, those in charge decided to weaponise their gender in efforts to not grant them the titles they deserve.\u201d\n\nHistorically, men appear to listen to rap music more than women, which may have an impact on the way they view the genre. Nielsen\u2019s 2015 Audience Insights revealed rap\u2019s most voracious fans were young African-American and Latino (Hispanic) men in the 18-24 age group.\n\nOn the corporate side, men have more often than not led labels and businesses in the genre. According to music journalist Keith Murphy, hip-hop\u2019s head honchos have control over who receives publicity and financial backing, leaving many female MCs excluded in order to push their \u201cmore relatable\u201d male counterparts. \u201cIt's a misogynistic way of writing hip-hop history,\u201d he says.\n\nBET Digital\u2019s Music Editor Diamond Hillyer agrees, stating that the long-time objectification and depreciation of women in hip-hop led to male rappers being \u2018unchallenged\u2019 in these spaces. However, female rappers have recently proved their prowess in the game, by way of chart-topping singles, sold-out shows and droves of adoring fans, providing healthy competition and leaving the egos of those who once reigned supreme bruised.\n\nAll three experts believe that there are certain standards that female musicians are told to abide by in order to gain acceptance through the eyes of male fans and industry powerbrokers. They have to be creative, knowledgeable and skilled at their craft, and yet, their male counterparts need not adhere to similarly strict criteria to gain attention.\n\nFor instance, Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion have shown their rapping abilities on numerous occasions; however, they are criticised for lyrical content that refers to sex and money. In the same vein, chart-topping rappers Future and Migos rhyme about sex, drugs and violence, which has garnered mainstream success and praise despite dipping into a similar pool of material.\n\nThe state of mainstream music may also have an effect on how female rappers are viewed in the eyes of hip-hop listeners. We\u2019re slowly whittling away at the archaic thought-process that one female rapper at a time can be highlighted (This was a non-issue in the \u201980s and early \u201990s, but following the well-documented Foxy Brown and Lil\u2019 Kim feud in the late \u201990s, there seemed to be a battle for mainstream supremacy between hip-hop\u2019s leading ladies until recently). Yet, it appears that the topic of aesthetic comes into play when discussing who gets attention from mainstream audiences.\n\nAs history shows, female rappers who fit the stereotype of a video vixen \u2013 buxom and scantily-clad \u2013 receive more mainstream attention. Hillyer says that while there is more acceptance regarding variety from a sonic standpoint, the media emphasises certain visual aesthetics over others.\n\nAesthetic and artistry are not mutually exclusive, yet, those seen as the antithesis of the stereotypical female rap aesthetic are not highlighted as frequently, despite the quality of their work. This is why mainstream will tend to focus their attention on a Cardi B more than a Chika today, or a Lil\u2019 Kim more than a Missy Elliott in days past.\n\n\u201cThis issue has the power to influence \u2013 and sometimes even determine \u2013 a female rapper\u2019s standing in the hip-hop race,\u201d Hillyer says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say female rap artists should \u2018tone down\u2019 the raciness of their image, or shrink away from their sexiness.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s a chance that casual rap fans aren\u2019t exploring the genre in more depth, or discovering female MCs outside of mainstream influence. This is a detriment to these artists and the listeners, who won\u2019t be hearing the true breadth of what the genre has to offer. However, streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music have allowed serious music fans to make their own discoveries without mainstream influence.\n\n\u201cAudiences are engaged with [an artist\u2019s] ascension because they have cultural memory of their first mixtapes on SoundCloud to the release of musical projects on a record label,\u201d Crumpton says. Had social media and streaming been as prevalent in hip-hop\u2019s highly prolific years (the 1990s and 2000s), many female rappers may have benefitted. Murphy believes that artists such as MC Lyte, Mia X, and Yo Yo could have benefitted from the invention of streaming, which could have resulted in their inclusion on \u201cbest-of\u201d lists.\n\nThis is not to say mainstream media outlets aren\u2019t doing what they can do highlight all sorts of female rappers; however, it could be doing more. Instead of amplifying the voices and the visibility of those who are gaining popularity or already have it, more attention could be directed to those still on the margins.\n\nLuckily, there have been several outlets both online and on-screen who have done their best to highlight female rappers, regardless of their popularity or looks. Netflix released a Roxanne Shante-centred film. Paper Magazine released a Women In Hip-Hop feature at the beginning of 2019, which highlighted burgeoning female MCs such as the quirky Rico Nasty and the slick-tongued Coi Leray.\n\nWhile there is room for everyone at rap\u2019s table, ultimately, the mindset of many fans, artists, and decision-makers may be the most challenging stumbling block. Allowing women to be celebrated in the spaces they fought so hard to be a part of (regardless of their looks or abilities) is one step towards more female-friendly \u201cbest-of\u201d lists in the future.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time, [women] are reclaiming the emancipation of our experiences, our bodies, our histories and our expectations in a way that\u2019s fun and meaningful to us,\u201d Hillyer says of female artists. \u201cIn many ways, this can also be the listening experience of men, with whom we share more similarities with than they realise.\u201d\n\nMore on BBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nWhy Juicy is number one (not available in UK)\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nPlaylist of the top 25 songs (Spotify)\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
