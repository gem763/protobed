But I felt pretty foolish when, in a vulnerable moment, I recently gave scammers direct access to my bank account. I fell for the phony \u2018AppleCare\u2019 scam and I hope my story about the experience keeps you from doing the same.\n\nI was fortunate to lose only $500, which is pretty common for this racket. The $500 came in the form of Google Play cards (Google GOOGL, +1.23% Play is the app store for Android phones) I was asked to purchase by a caller who said he was a \u201ctech support specialist\u201d from AppleCare (technical support for Apple AAPL, -0.23% devices, though he wasn\u2019t really such a person).\n\nScams involving Google Play cards and tech \u2018support\u2019\n\nHe brazenly told me he needed my help to catch hackers with IP addresses from China and Russia who had compromised my account. Actually, these phishing con artists immediately remove the cash value from the Google Play card, making the card worthless to you.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned that neither Apple (nor Microsoft MSFT, +1.03% ) will ever call a customer. But many people don\u2019t know that.\n\nThis \u201ctech support\u201d scheme was the second most common phone scam in the first half of 2019, following Social Security fraud. And according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), personal losses related to gift card purchases totaled $53 million through September 2018. That\u2019s up from $20 million for the entire year of 2015. And it represents only those cases that have been reported.\n\nAlthough my out-of-pocket loss came to just $500, the opportunity cost was at least 10 times that because of the hours I had to devote to cleaning up the mess I\u2019d made which I could\u2019ve spent earning freelance money.\n\nHow I became a victim of this scam\n\nHere\u2019s my scam story:\n\nIt was the day after returning from a two-week trip to Uganda. I\u2019d traveled for 24 hours and was catching up on work after sleeping nine hours straight. I\u2019d just wrapped up a conference call when the phone rang. It was an 800-number and I reflexively answered since the conference call also had an 800-prefix.\n\n\u201cThis is AppleCare. Your account may have been compromised,\u201d I remember hearing the caller say. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing IP addresses from China and Russia accessing it.\u201d\n\nMy mind flashed back to seeing a notification about my iCloud account that I\u2019d chosen to ignore while on the road. I told the \u201cAppleCare\u201d man about it, and said I\u2019d been traveling in Africa. I was asked if I\u2019d used any unsafe networks while abroad. I knew I had at least once, despite a warning the hotel network might be unsecured.\n\nI believed I\u2019d enabled the hack through my carelessness. As I started to berate myself aloud, the caller told me not to be so hard on myself. He would stay with me and install provisions to prevent this from happening again, he said, comfortingly.\n\nThe first step was walking through my computer\u2019s settings to turn off my history and cookies and turn on the firewall. Next, I was to hand over control of my laptop so the caller could check it out. I did.\n\n\u2018How do I know YOU are who you say you are?\u2019\n\nAt one point, I asked, \u201cWell how do I know YOU are who you say you are?\u201d He invited me to double-check the number he was calling from against the AppleCare website. I couldn\u2019t be bothered. I just wanted to get this mess fixed and finished. Chances are if I had checked, I\u2019d actually have found the number (not realizing it was bogus). Phone scammers have become skilled at making legitimate numbers appear in your phone ID.\n\nAs the caller steered my computer, we started to talk. He confirmed he was calling from India. Offshore tech support is the norm these days, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nWe entered a site designed to look like it came from the U.S. government. I remember being surprised that Apple was working so intimately with the government, but the site looked legit. So, I kept going.\n\n\u201cOnly 10 more minutes,\u201d I was promised.\n\nOur next destination was something called the \u201cCoinbase\u201d site, which I was told would register me in the government system and install a protective shield against future invasions. (Coinbase is actually a digital currency exchange for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.) I just had to scan in my driver\u2019s license as well as my Social Security number, although that number was masked.\n\nUs. vs. them\n\nThe scammer had artfully turned this into an \u201cus vs. them\u201d affair and I was in it for the long haul.\n\nI observed his cursor moving around inside my bank account (which I had logged into for him) and when I questioned why multiple payments of $1,000 each were going to a \u201cRonnald,\u201d I was shown other screens to demonstrate the money was still in my account and that the actual \u201ctransaction\u201d was $0.\n\nAgain, he said, this was part of trapping the hackers.\n\nThe scammer showed me he\u2019d put $300 into my account and said I\u2019d need to purchase Google Play cards \u2014 ideally three in $100 denominations. He called up the item on Amazon to show me what they looked like.\n\nAlso see: As alleged $46M online-dating scam shows, lonely-hearts are the biggest target for scam artists in America\n\nIt was hot. I was tired. I would do anything to make it all end. And so\u2026\n\nI drove to the nearest store I thought would carry $100 Google Play cards \u2014 a Rite Aid RAD, -21.28% \u2014 and followed my caller\u2019s instructions to keep my phone in the car so no one could detect us talking. The Google Cards were there, and I paid using the debit card for the account where I\u2019d witnessed the caller adding $300. Back in the car, I read him the 16-digits over the phone and the PIN.\n\nThe digit problem\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell if one of the digits was the letter O or a zero and said since he was the expert, he could figure that out. While driving home, the scammer told me he\u2019d guessed wrong and the cards wouldn\u2019t work. I\u2019d have to find another store with $100 Google Play cards, he said, adding that $50 cards would also work.\n\nBut his time, he told me, we\u2019d need $500 in Google Play cards. He told me he\u2019d put the $500 into my account to pay for them.\n\nAt the next store, a CVS CVS, -0.14% , fortune stepped in. Although I went to the register with $500 worth of Google Play cards, only $200 could be validated because of a problem on the store\u2019s side.\n\nNow going on hour three with my friend from \u201cAppleCare,\u201d I drove home. Once there, I again read the caller the numbers for the Google Play cards. I was instructed to log into my bank account again and then received a message that it had been frozen because of suspicious activity.\n\nThe bank staffer\u2019s question\n\nThe \u201cAppleCare technician\u201d advised me to call the bank and assure them I had made the transactions. I did, and someone at the bank asked me three questions including: Are you willing to confirm this transaction if you will never get the money back? I paused for a long time, and finally said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: Apple will allow more small repair shops to fix iPhones\n\nNext, I followed my caller\u2019s instructions to buy two Target TGT, -0.03% gift cards totaling $1,000, and I went to the nearest store to do so. But when I went to the register, neither my debit card nor credit card would work.\n\nWhen I returned to the car, the voice on the phone sounded different. Suddenly, I was told to get gift cards totaling $500, and not to go to the same register as before. I went back, my cards still wouldn\u2019t work and got back in the car.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d I told the caller. He said to call the number on the back of my card and to keep him on the line so he could hear what I said.\n\n\u2018Hang up. Now.\u2019\n\nThis time, I was speaking with the credit card department. The bank official asked if someone was with me. I explained he was on my other phone and the banker said, \u201cHang up. Now.\u201d\n\nI did, and phony \u201cAppleCare\u201d called me back. Twice. And then texted me.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The real reason Apple hasn\u2019t launched a pocket-sized iPhone\n\nI took my devices to the Apple store to be checked for malware and contamination. The tech there cleaned my computer and we changed all my critical usernames and passwords.\n\nThe next morning, I went to my bank to start changing my account numbers. We reversed a $400 bitcoin purchase that had been made through the Coinbase account. The bank also agreed to reverse two charges that had been made for Amazon AMZN, +1.13% purchases \u2014 one for $30 and then a second for $45.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned that retailers are training their employees to be alert to customers like me. And my banker said she deals with cases like mine several times a month.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m monitoring my accounts regularly, setting fraud alerts and becoming more vigilant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up,\u201d the real Apple service person told me. \u201cMy father works in IT and he\u2019s been taken twice.\u201d\n\nHow to avoid becoming a victim of these scams\n\nA few tips based on my experience:\n\nIf someone you don\u2019t know asks you to make a payment by a gift card, it\u2019s a scam.\n\nNever give control of your computer to someone who calls you unsolicited or who has sent you an email.\n\nDon\u2019t enter personal information into a site that\u2019s handed back and forth with a stranger.\n\nAnd finally, if you are victimized unwittingly in such a scheme, contact your bank and the gift card issuer immediately.
