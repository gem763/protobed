The five-year targets include efficiency gains, U.S. revenue growth of about 10 per cent a year and doubling U.S. market share. The push comes as banks across Europe are cutting costs, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale trimming operations abroad amid restructurings.\n\nBarclay said the U.S. offers the best chance to \u201cscale up,\u201d presenting \u201cbroad-based opportunities\u201d in areas including investment banking and trading.\n\nBMO Capital Markets earned about 44 per cent of its $3.56 billion (US$2.68 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of the year from the U.S., where it focuses on mid-market clients from key offices in New York, Chicago, Houston and San Francisco. It\u2019s shooting for 45 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\nBMO Capital Markets is the only one of six major Canadian bank-owned investment banking platforms to post higher revenue this year, with a 10 per cent gain in the first three fiscal quarters fuelled by trading and investment-banking fees. Like its Canadian peers, overall net income in capital markets has declined, though Bank of Montreal\u2019s 4.8 per cent profit slide is less than all others except larger rival Royal Bank of Canada.\n\n\u201cThings are working: Our revenue growth is stronger than everybody else\u2019s,\u201d said Barclay, a former mergers-and-acquisitions banker who became group head on Nov. 1. \u201cWe\u2019re achieving the outcomes we want, and in my mind I have high confidence that we\u2019re going to hit those targets.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "BMO expects to reach its goal of being a 'Top 10' North American investment bank 'dramatically' ahead of its five-year deadline", "authors": ["Doug Alexander", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bmo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
