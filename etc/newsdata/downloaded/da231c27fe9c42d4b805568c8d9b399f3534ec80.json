Courtesy Lufthansa\n\nThe plane's slats and side panels have been transformed into coffee tables, while a separate table has been made from two of its windows and a sheet of safety glass.\n\nFour of its other windows were converted into two trendy wall bars, and a further 20 have been made into wall clocks.\n\nMany are one-off items and this is clearly reflected in the prices.\n\nThe tables range from $1,550 to $3,300, while the wall bars cost between $1,327 and $1,660.\n\nA keyring made from the plane's aluminum cladding will set you back $27.\n\n\"The special thing about the Lufthansa Upcycling Collection is that something of the aircraft's spirit can be preserved,\" says Sebastian Riedle, spokesperson and managing director of Miles & More GmbH.\n\nRelated content 8 airplanes converted into restaurants\n\nSecond life\n\nThe Lufthansa Upcycling Collection includes a wall bar made from two of the airplane's windows.

Lufthansa was one of the A340's biggest operators.\n\nThe airline's design team have also made good use of the aircraft's exterior, creating briefcases and backpacks from business class blankets and headrest covers branded with its now defunct logo, which were \"much too valuable to throw away.\"\n\nEven the plane's safety cards have been recycled and used to reinforce the bottom of upcycled wash bags.\n\nIt took nearly 10 weeks to dismantle the 75-meter long airplane into pieces small enough to create the Lufthansa Upcycling Collection.\n\nApproximately 92% of the original aircraft, which was the world's longest passenger aircraft at the time of its launch, was recycled for the project.\n\nRepurposing aircraft parts as quality goods is getting increasingly popular as the airline industry moves towards becoming more eco-friendly.\n\nAirbus released a line of furniture and home accessories made from upcycled aircraft parts via online shop A Piece of Sky earlier this year.", "description": "Pieces of a retired Lufthansa Airbus A340-600 have been transformed into stylish coffee tables, clocks, luggage and other pieces of furniture and offered up for sale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190919135626-lufthansa-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
