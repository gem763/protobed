You have to find your downed teammates and figure out how things went so wrong, so quickly.\n\nYour Ghost team, a U.S. Special Forces group, is in trouble and confused. But it still your job to sort things out.\n\nThat's the backdrop under which you'll play \"Breakpoint,\" the latest installment in the Ghost Recon video game series. The game was released on Oct. 4 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC ($59.99-up, for ages 17-up).\n\nYou play as Nomad, leader of the Ghost team sent to the island of Auroa. It's a vast locale filled with gear to choose from and enemies to shoot. It's also kind of boring.\n\n'Call of Duty: Mobile': Video game offensive boasts new 'Fortnite'-style battle royale mode\n\nScreen time: How to handle your children's smartphone, tablet and video game addictions\n\nHere is what to know about the game.\n\nIt\u2019s a victim of its own open-world design\n\nA strength of \"Breakpoint\" is that you can go anywhere on the island. You can get there via any number of vehicles and perfectly placed quick travel spots. You can even do missions in any order you choose. It's a refreshing sense of freedom.\n\nThe problem? \"Breakpoint\" somehow manages to make it all too bland.\n\nAfter more than 35 hours of playing the game, I pondered why I found most of the single-player experience to be forgettable despite some good development ideas.\n\nI think it's because the developers spent so much time building a potentially exhilarating world that they ran out of time to make it fun to navigate. The missions, for example, provide variety in terms of how you get to your missions.\n\nBut once you get there, you'll fight a repetitious cadre of enemies and go through similar sequences of steps \u2013 from how you enter the area to how you take down the enemies \u2013before you can investigate the latest development.\n\nGhost Recon Breakpoints map is beautiful (Photo: Ubisoft)\n\nMultiplayer: promising, but needs work\n\nIt\u2019s the multiplayer mode where I believe the game could have some sustainable shine to it, but even it needs help.\n\nJoin the current version of Ghost War to spawn into a team of four players who battle it out in a couple of different modes. Your gear, rating, and overall loadout cross over from the story campaign. There is some balancing to make multiplayer matches more evenly fought, but your character is largely here as in the main game. The maps are small, which is perfect because players tend to camp. These are all good things.\n\nWhere the PvP fails is in the lack of variety in game modes and the excruciating wait times between rounds and matches. It\u2019s ridiculous how long players must wait. The wait between rounds can be up to five minutes, which at times was longer than the round itself. It all just bogs the multiplayer down.\n\nThe amount of gear and content is impressive\n\nWhat kind of weapon do you prefer? What attachment? What about devices and support gear? \"Breakpoint\" has you covered in a big way. One of the game's few redeeming qualities is the robust library of weapons and gadgets to try out.\n\nI would recommend equipping your rifles with grenade launchers as soon as you can \u2013 something I took far too long to do. And, for sure, I would suggest buying an armored vehicle when you can, too, because it increases the fun factor \u2013 you can run over enemies and bash into enemy vehicles.\n\nTake advantage of the quality of life features\n\nGhost Recond Breakpoint lets make adjustments at campsites (Photo: Ubisoft)\n\nWhat\u2019s easy to lose in mountains of gears and content is that the developers were gracious enough to make things easier with the campgrounds scattered through the island.\n\nYou\u2019ll unlock these camping sites as you play and should use them frequently. You can adjust the gear you\u2019ve picked up, change your skill tree, and search the in-game shop.\n\nThis is vitally important in a game because the game puts such an emphasis on your gear score and being able to travel between missions. Buy new equipment and choose your transportation from the camp. Plus you're able to carry a large amount of gear around as you play, which is a huge thing for gamers that developers often limit.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2019/10/19/ghost-recon-breakpoint-what-to-know/3973278002/", "description": "'Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint' gives you a ton of weapons and a beautiful island to hunt enemies on.
