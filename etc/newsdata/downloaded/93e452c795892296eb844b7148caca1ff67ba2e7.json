His five-bedroom Bermuda villa is on the market for $US8.5 million ($12 million) \u2013 redundant since Oracle Team USA's unsuccessful defence of the America's Cup there last June.\n\nAside from Spithill's income as one of the world's most in-demand helmsmen \u2013 America's Cup wages are closely guarded secrets \u2013 this property portfolio accounts for his repeat appearance on the Financial Review Young Rich List. In 2018 he's ranked number 80 with a net fortune of $31 million.\n\n\"I'm a huge fan of real estate,\" he says. \"From a kid labouring on building sites in the holidays with my father, I really appreciated what it meant by adding value. I haven't done much in stocks. To be quite honest, I don't understand it enough and can't give it the time. I've always liked the fact that with property, you can see it.\"\n\nHis aggressiveness on the water is not reflected in his approach to investing \"because I know how hard it is to make a dollar. I'm more about the long-term approach now that I've got a family.\"\n\nSan Diego, Cagliari, Auckland\n\nWhen The Australian Financial Review Magazine pins down the mercurial father of two for a chat, he's at his house in San Diego, California, the hometown of his wife Jennifer. His new gig with team Luna Rossa means being based in Cagliari, Italy. And soon his world will shift again \u2013 to Auckland, New Zealand, to prepare for the 2021 America's Cup.\n\nIt's the class of sailing that's closest to Formula One motorsport. Since 2010, when multihulls were introduced, design and engineering \u2013 and therefore mega-investment \u2013 have been foremost. The 2017 cup boats were foiling catamarans; in 2021 they will be foiling monohulls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The iconic thing about the America's Cup is that when you win it you get to decide on how the next one will run, including what the boats will look like,\" says Spithill. \"This foiling monohull is quite revolutionary.\"\n\nIt means Spithill and his team of sailors, designers, boat builders, engineers and software programmers have four years to create two boats for the tournament, at an outlay by Luna Rossa's owners of up to $US100 million.\n\nBoxer, pilot, paddleboarder\n\nIf it's a moneyed world that Spithill rolls in, it's not what drives him. \"The one thing that people involved in the America's Cup have in common is they're really passionate about what they do. And ultimately they don't want to let their teammates down. That's a really cool environment to be in.\"\n\nSpithill's work ethic is as famous as his athleticism. Having taken up boxing to defend himself against relentless schoolyard bullying for being a redhead, he ended up becoming an amateur champion. The Red Bull athlete has his pilot's licence and has flown with the US Navy's F-18 Blue Angels aerobatic team. He is one of few people in the world to have completed a forward roll in a helicopter and has completed two Molokai 2 Oahu Paddleboard World Championships \u2013 52 kilometres of open ocean stand-up paddling.\n\nHe tries to return to his beloved Pittwater each Christmas and has just been in Australia as an ambassador for the Invictus Games for injured armed services personnel, a cause close to his heart given his brother works for the charity Soldier On. \"Anyone who serves I've got a huge amount of respect for. I've always wondered if I didn't go into sport I may have joined the armed forces.\"\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue is out on Friday October 26 inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue will be on news stands for the next four weeks.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram", "description": "This yachtsman and Young Rich Lister is risk averse only when it comes to investing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.5274%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1517%2C$x_464%2C$y_88/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/95bce7a48e9b0ba9065aa448afb36a5edf53345c", "published_at": "2018-08-14"}
