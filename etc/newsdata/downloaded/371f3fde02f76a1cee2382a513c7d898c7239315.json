It soothes the soul, travels out of windows and into the street, spreading delight in a way no other scent can. Today\u2019s recipe is particularly aromatic: a cheat\u2019s croissant made with pre-rolled puff-pastry filled with a push-of-a-button pistachio marzipan and sweet cherries. So few ingredients and little work for such lovely smells and so much joy \u2026 you may as well fling open the windows (and pass a plate around).\n\nPistachio and cherry croissants\n\nYou can use frozen cherries, if you like \u2013 just defrost them fully first. The cherries will produce some juice that you won\u2019t need here, but it keeps for three days in the fridge \u2013 use it in cocktails. You\u2019ll need a food processor for the pistachio paste.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nMakes 16\n\n200g fresh cherries, pitted (or frozen cherries, defrosted)\n\n1 tbsp icing sugar, plus a little extra to dust\n\n100g unsalted pistachio kernels\n\n4 tbsp brown rice syrup\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\n\u00bd tbsp flavourless oil, such as rapeseed, plus extra for brushing\n\nSalt\n\n2 x 320g packets pre-rolled puff pastry sheets \u2013 I like Jus-Rol\u2019s\n\nHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two oven trays with nonstick baking paper. Finely chop the cherries, put them in a bowl with the icing sugar and leave to steep.\n\nMeera Sodha\u2019s vegan recipe for courgette and chickpea dal | The New Vegan Read more\n\nFinely chop a tablespoon of the pistachios and set aside. Put the rest of the nuts, syrup, vanilla, oil and a good pinch of salt in the bowl of a food processor, and blitz until it comes together like wet dough.\n\nUnfurl one pack of pastry. With the longest side parallel to the edge of the worktop, mark it out into quarters, then cut across the whole sheet from top left to bottom right and top right to bottom left \u2013 you will end up with eight pastry triangles. Repeat with the second pastry sheet.\n\nPut a sieve over a small bowl and drain the cherries (reserve the juice). Take one triangle and put the shortest side parallel to the worktop \u2013 this should be a long, skinny triangle with a sharp, slightly off-centre point at the top, so stretch the base a bit to even it out.\n\nPut a scant teaspoon each of the pistachio paste and drained cherries on the bottom of the triangle, 2cm from the edge \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to use more, or it\u2019ll be too fat to roll. Roll the bottom edge over the filling and keep rolling, with the filling central \u2013 you\u2019ll end up with a chubby bit in the middle and two horns. Fold the horns in towards each other to form a crescent, and pinch the ends closed as necessary.\n\nPut on the lined tray, then repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 15 more croissants. Brush each with oil, and bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp and golden.\n\nDust liberally with icing sugar and chopped pistachios, and leave to cool.", "description": "The smell of baking pastry is one of the world\u2019s favourite aromas, and readymade puff means you can enjoy croissants with far less fuss than usual", "authors": ["Meera Sodha"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f303d87d6aa7e8a2098a54f813aaa998751722eb/0_84_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b92a8f33f087432f8c3cb50a9a2e8ee", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
