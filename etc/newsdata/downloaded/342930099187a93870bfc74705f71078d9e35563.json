He has been at the forefront of initiatives to develop the sport and protect the marine environment, the IMSHOF said.\n\nWoodring, who used to work at Merrill Lynch Asset Management, started his journey to environmental activism when he began to organise swimming events.\n\n\u201cWhen we started swimming events, like the Shek O Challenge in 2003, we had to pitch our location depending on where the pollution was at that time of year,\u201d Woodring told \ufeffThe Post. The Clean Half 15km swimming race was one of his first events, and was so named because it was on the clean half of Hong Kong Island.\n\nSince then, he has founded Ocean Recovery Alliance and been at the forefront of cleaning up marine environments, not only in Hong Kong, but all around the world, with imaginative ideas to combat pollution. He started an App called Global Alert, allowing anyone in the world to report rubbish hotspots.\n\nHe also started the Oceanic Big Five, where swimmers, surfers, paddlers, divers and sailors engage globally in a clean-up day.\n\nThe Plasticity Forum is also one of Woodring\u2019s ideas. The business event allows company owners and innovators to exchange goals and solutions to reducing waste. Woodring founded and launched this event at the Rio+20 Earth Summit in 2012, and has since held it in Hong Kong, New York, Portugal, Shanghai, London, Dallas, Los Angeles, Sydney, Kuala Lumpur, Fiji, Amsterdam, and, most recently, Bangkok.\n\nWoodring has travelled the world helping others make the same changes he has worked hard to implement. He recalled a visit to the Samsung Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swim in Turkey. \u201cYou could tell they just didn\u2019t plan for the waste at all,\u201d he said of his visit three years ago. \u201cThere was garbage all over the floor.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Woodring gave the Bosphorus race organisers a checklist called the Plastic Disclosure Project, to help them identify ways to improve conditions. \u201cThey were very receptive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew it was good for their brand and wouldn\u2019t cost much.\u201d\n\nIt is just one of many successes Woodring has had in his environmental campaign. All the while he has been helping develop open-water swimming in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt used to be people were afraid of the pollution, of sharks, and their parents would tell them not to go in the water,\u201d Woodring said. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t go outside the shark nets, but now there are groups that regularly go out every weekend.\u201d\n\nAlong with The Clean Half, he also hosts the Cold Half. As they have grown in popularity, word has spread and now top swimmers come to visit for the events.\n\n\u201cEven five years ago, no one would have thought to come to Hong Kong to race,\u201d Woodring said.\n\n\u201cI hope to see more people enjoying the water.\u201d", "description": "Woodring introduced The Clean Half swimming races and sparked growth in open-water swimming\n  Woodring helped shape swimming\u2019s approach to marine environmental sustainability and encouraged other major events to follow suit", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/30/ddd61a12-fac0-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_130118.JPG?itok=AHWZpaXx&v=1572411689", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
