For more recent figures, Judge referred HuffPost to the website 11foot8.com, which documented 33 collisions since the beginning of 2017 \u2015 or roughly one per month.\n\nJurgen Henn, who runs the YouTube channel and the 11foot8.com website, keeps cameras set up near the intersection, according to his site. He started recording the underpass in 2008 after hearing the crashes from his nearby office for years, Henn has told multiple news outlets.\n\nHenn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile it\u2019s good news for motorists and pedestrians that the bridge will finally be a safer height, many locals and other fans of mayhem are mourning the \u201cend of an era.\u201d\n\n\"...in order to raise the 11\u2019-8\u201d Railroad Overpass\" \u2639\ufe0f\n\n\n\nGuess it\u2019s time to plan a Retro night where we watch nothing but old clips of 11\u2019 8\u201d crashes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea7 .... \ud83d\ude9b ... \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\nDo we have to wait 20 years, @retrofilmseries? pic.twitter.com/3YYsQ86LG6 \u2014 Carolina Theatre (@CarolinaDurham) October 18, 2019", "description": "An 11-foot-8-inch railroad overpass in Durham is being raised after years of viral videos showing it lopping the tops off of vehicles.", "authors": ["Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dac55d3210000821cad354b.png?cache=lokvvzdq5f&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
