What\u2019s the road to redemption?\u2019\u201d the Me Too founder told Teen Vogue in an interview published Tuesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just like, you know what? Stop asking me these questions. It\u2019s so offensive.\u201d\n\nBurke, who created the Me Too movement in 2007, reflected on how the campaign has grown exponentially since it went viral two years ago this month. Actor Alyssa Milano tweeted the hashtag #MeToo two years ago, asking her followers to share their stories of sexual violence. The movement has revealed rampant abuse by powerful men including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s important to unearth abuses that have been hidden for so long, Burke told Teen Vogue that the movement was meant to center survivors, not perpetrators.\n\n\u201cOften when I talk, I do a pop quiz for people and I say, \u2018You know, we can right now popcorn at least 10 names of the most prominent men who\u2019ve been accused or what have you, and you couldn\u2019t name 10 survivors from there,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2018s such a problem, that we can have a movement that has really been built on the backs of survivors and not check in on those survivors,\u201d Burke continued. \u201cYes, it would have been a celebrity story, because Weinstein was a huge story, and it would have continued to be a huge story. But this sustained conversation, this phenomenon came from 19 million individual people having the courage to say \u2018me too.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that it\u2019s \u201cinhumane\u201d that the cultural conversation continually centers perpetrators over survivors.\n\n\u201cYou cannot forget these people. You cannot forget us. You cannot forget people who have the courage,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you volunteered for an expose, or you literally just put #MeToo on your Facebook page. There is courage in that.\u201d\n\nHead over to Teen Vogue to read Burke\u2019s full interview.", "description": "On the second anniversary since the Me Too movement went viral, the founder reminds us to center survivors, not perpetrators.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5c7d0200000c70c501713.jpeg?cache=0vrqkofqn1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
