The vote went 322-308 against the government.\n\nTuesday\u2019s votes plunge the tortuous Brexit process back into grimly familiar territory: acrimonious uncertainty.\n\nWithout speedy passage of the bill, Britain won\u2019t be able to make an orderly exit from the bloc on Oct. 31, the central vow of Johnson\u2019s three-month-old administration.\n\nLooking on the bright side, Johnson hailed the fact that \u201cfor the first time in this long saga this House has actually accepted its responsibilities together, come together, and embraced a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which this House has just given its assent,\u201d he said \u2014 though he also said the government would \u201caccelerate\u201d preparations for a no-deal outcome because of the uncertainty.\n\nJohnson had hoped to push the legislation through the House of Commons by Thursday. But he said after the defeat that he would \u201cpause\u201d the bill until the EU had decided whether to agree to delay Britain\u2019s departure.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Tusk tweeted that he would recommend that the bloc grant Britain\u2019s request for an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline. He did not say how long a delay he would recommend, although the U.K.\u2019s request was to postpone exit until Jan. 31.\n\nThat request came grudgingly from Johnson last week to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nAny delay will still require the agreement of all of the other 27 EU member states, and they are deeply weary of the long-running Brexit saga. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told French lawmakers Tuesday that he sees \u201cno justification\u201d at this stage for a further delay.\n\nBut they also want to avoid the economic pain on both sides of the Channel that would come from a chaotic British exit.\n\nEarlier, Johnson had said he might call a vote on holding a snap general election if Parliament blocked his plans \u2014 in the hopes of breaking the political deadlock over Brexit that has dragged on as lawmakers have squabbled over the country\u2019s departure terms. But he\u2019s likely to wait to hear from the EU on the delay request before deciding whether to push for an election.\n\nBut before Tuesday\u2019s vote, he said: \u201cI will in no way allow months more of this.\u201d\n\nLast week Johnson struck a divorce deal with the other EU leaders, but on Saturday he failed to win Parliament\u2019s backing for it. His only remaining hope of leaving on time was to get lawmakers to pass the Brexit-implementing bill into law before the scheduled departure date, nine days away.\n\nThe Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, including measures to maintain an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. It also enshrines the right of U.K. and EU citizens living in the other\u2019s territory to continue with their lives, and sets out the multibillion pound (dollar) payments Britain must make to meet its financial obligations to the EU.\n\nBut the deal does not cover the nitty gritty of future relations between the U.K. and the EU: Instead, it confirms a transition period lasting until at least the end of 2020 \u2014 and possibly 2022 \u2014 in which relations will remain frozen as they are now while a permanent new relationship is worked out.\n\nIf Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there will be no transition period, uncertainty for millions of citizens and a host of new tariffs, customs checks and other barriers to trade on Day 1. Most economists say that would send unemployment rising, the value of the pound plummeting and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nMany lawmakers felt that three days was not nearly enough time for scrutiny of the 115-page bill. Major bills usually take weeks or months to pass through Parliament, giving time for line-by-line scrutiny by lawmakers.\n\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s votes, Green lawmaker Caroline Lucas tweeted that lawmakers \u201chad more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act (affecting 19 animals) than they will to decide the future of 65 million people. It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\u201d\n\nAfter the votes, many lawmakers urged Johnson to push ahead with the bill after securing a delay to Brexit. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged the prime minister to \u201cwork with us all of use to agree a reasonable timetable\u201d for its passage.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, an ardent Brexit supporter, acknowledged that the prospect of an Oct. 31 Brexit now seemed remote.\n\n\u201cImpossible is a very strong word, but it is very hard to see how it is possible,\u201d he said.", "description": "Boris Johnson won Parliament\u2019s backing for the substance of his exit deal but lost a key vote on its timing, a result that inches him closer to his goal of...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT822_boris__ZG_20191023024315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
