Kavanaugh \u2014 written in 2009, when Kavanaugh was an appeals court judge \u2014 saying that \u201ca President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ordered a hearing on the lawsuit for Sept. 25. Vance agreed to delay enforcement of the subpoena until after that hearing.\n\nThe suit is the latest in a string of similar lawsuits by Trump seeking to block investigations of his finances by prosecutors and New York authorities.\n\nIn this case, Vance subpoenaed Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, Trump\u2019s attorneys said. He asked for eight years\u2019 worth of tax returns for Trump and his businesses, plus a number of other financial documents, according to Trump\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe investigation appears to focus on payments to two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who say they had affairs with Trump years ago.\n\nDaniels, an adult-film actress, was paid $130,000 by then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen for her silence before the 2016 election. Cohen said that the payments were made at Trump\u2019s direction and that Trump\u2019s company reimbursed him. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations related to the hush-money payments, as well as other offenses.\n\nMcDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer. The company acknowledged that payment last year and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nTrump has said he did not have affairs with Daniels or McDougal. Trump, his aides and his attorneys have made contradictory statements about the president\u2019s knowledge of the payments. Still, his attorneys have repeatedly denied that Trump committed wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cNo campaign violations were engaged in by the president,\u201d Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, said this month.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed Thursday, Trump said that Vance did not need eight years of his tax returns to examine whether any laws were broken by the 2016 payments. In the lawsuit, Trump calls Vance\u2019s subpoena to Mazars \u201ca bad faith effort to harass the President by obtaining and exposing his private financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.\u201d\n\nSekulow said in a brief statement Thursday that \u201cwe have filed a lawsuit this morning in Federal Court on behalf of the President in order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case.\u201d\n\nDanny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, said only that \u201cwe have received the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and will respond as appropriate in court.\u201d\n\nIn April, Trump filed a similar lawsuit against Mazars, seeking to stop it from complying with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee. In July, Trump sued the House Ways and Means Committee and New York state to block the state from using a newly passed law to share Trump\u2019s state tax returns with Congress.\n\nBoth cases are pending.\n\nAlso Thursday, a federal judge in Sacramento issued a temporary injunction against a law that would bar presidential candidates from appearing on California\u2019s 2020 primary ballot if they decline to release their tax returns.\n\nSoon after the measure was signed into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in July, Trump and the Republican National Committee filed lawsuits challenging it, arguing that California was attempting to \u201ccircumvent the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nSekulow said in a statement that the president\u2019s legal team was \u201cencouraged\u201d by U.S. District Judge Morrison England Jr.\u2019s decision and looked forward to the formal ruling.\n\n\u201cIt remains our position that the law is unconstitutional because states are not permitted to add additional requirements for candidates for president, and that the law violates the Constitution,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nCarol D.
