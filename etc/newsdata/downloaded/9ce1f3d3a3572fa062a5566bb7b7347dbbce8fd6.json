Macy, and her \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d co-star Eva Longoria.\n\nHuffman, in a three-page letter filed Friday with the federal court in Boston that is handling the sweeping bribery scheme, said she has \u201ca deep and abiding shame\u201d for her actions.\n\nShe said she has found motherhood to be \u201cbewildering\u201d and had turned to the scheme in the hopes of giving her oldest daughter a chance to pursue her dream of acting.\n\nHuffman said in the letter that her daughter has a diagnosed learning disability and struggles with math.\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother, I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d Huffman wrote to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. \u201cI see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, meanwhile, argues that Huffman should spend 30 days in jail because she knew the scheme was wrong and participated anyway.\n\n\u201cHer efforts weren\u2019t driven by need or desperation, but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth and insularity,\u201d his office wrote in its filing Friday. \u201cMillions of parents send their kids to college every year. All of them care as much she does about their children\u2019s fortunes. But they don\u2019t buy fake SAT scores and joke about it (\u2018Ruh Ro!\u2019) along the way.\u201d\n\nHuffman used the Scooby-Doo catchphrase in an email after her daughter\u2019s high school tried to make her take the exam with its own proctor instead of one preferred by the consultant she was paying.\n\nHuffman\u2019s filing also included more than two dozen letters of support, among them pleas from Macy and Longoria.\n\nMacy, who wasn\u2019t charged in the scheme, said in his own letter to the judge that their family has struggled since his wife\u2019s arrest.\n\nHuffman has rarely left the house and hasn\u2019t received an audition or job offer since her arrest six months ago, he said.\n\nTheir oldest daughter is taking a gap year and not attending college for now, Macy said. And the family, which also includes a younger daughter in high school, is also seeing a therapist together.\n\n\u201cFelicity\u2019s only interest now is figuring out how to make amends,\u201d Macy wrote, \u201cand help her daughters heal and move on.\u201d\n\nLongoria, in her two-page statement, recalls Huffman had a \u201cgentle character\u201d and \u201ckind heart\u201d while the two starred in \u201cHousewives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I began the TV show, I was very new to the business and industry as a whole. Felicity was the first one to take me under her wing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know I would not have survived those years if it wasn\u2019t for the friendship of Felicity.\u201d\n\nLongoria also wrote: \u201cShe always leads with her heart and has always put others first.\u201d\n\nHuffman is among 51 people charged in a scheme in which prosecutors say wealthy parents paid an admissions consultant to bribe coaches and test administrators to help their children get into prestigious colleges.\n\nShe pleaded guilty in May to fraud charges for paying $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter\u2019s SAT exam answers. She is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 13.\n\nThe amount she paid is among the smaller bribes alleged in the scheme. Fellow actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, for example, are charged with paying $500,000 for their two daughters to get into college. Unlike Huffman, they are fighting the charges.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers are arguing for one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. They say in their filing that fraud cases involving standardized tests \u201calmost always\u201d result in probation and that incarceration is \u201cexceptionally rare.\u201d\n\nThey also argue that a sentence including 250 hours of community service would be significantly more than judges typically hand down.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers say the 56-year-old Emmy Award-winning actress proposes completing those service hours with organizations that work with at-risk youth in the Los Angeles area, where she lives.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office also seeks a year of probation after jail and a $20,000 fine.\n\nIt argues that a one-month jail sentence recognizes that Huffman quickly accepted responsibility after being arrested and charged. Under federal sentencing guidelines, prosecutors could have sought up to six months\u2019 incarceration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bill Kole contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Felicity Huffman and her lawyers pleaded Friday for probation, community service and a fine instead of jail time for her role in the college admissions scandal, buoyed by letters of support from her famous husband, William H.
