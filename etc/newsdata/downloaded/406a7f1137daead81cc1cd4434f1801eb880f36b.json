The city\u2019s subway operator restricted passenger access to the West Kowloon train station.\n\nSupporters of the movement gathered at the rally\u2019s starting point on a waterfront promenade. Many wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nOrganizers said they wanted to use their right to protest, as guaranteed by the city\u2019s constitution despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using peaceful, rational, nonviolent way to voice our demands,\u201d Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of being arrested. What I\u2019m most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\u201d\n\nThe group has organized some of the movement\u2019s biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.\n\nPolice on Saturday arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist distributing leaflets near a wall plastered with pro-democracy messages. A witness told local broadcaster RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \u201ca part of China\u201d and other pro-Beijing messages.\n\nThe movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for a China extradition bill and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong protesters again flooded streets on Sunday, ignoring a police ban on the rally and demanding the government meet their demands", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/40ab10_hong-kong-protests-14930-protesters-carrying-umbrellas-huge-banner-baring-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
