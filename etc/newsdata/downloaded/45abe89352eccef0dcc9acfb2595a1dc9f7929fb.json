This is, of course, the company that made Colin Kaepernick the centerpiece of an ad campaign whose tagline was \u2014 wait for it \u2014 \u201cBelieve in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\u201d\n\nEverything except \u2026 yuans, did they mean?\n\nA Twitter pal suggests a new slogan: \u201cBelieve in money. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\u201d\n\nManagers at five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during visits on Thursday they had been told in recent days via a memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Reuters was unable to view the memo\u2026 Three Nike stores in Shenzhen also kept Rockets merchandise off the shelves, as well as NBA products in general, staff told Reuters by phone. Three Nike stores in Chengdu, a bustling inland city in southwest China, also removed Rockets products\u2026 \u201cRockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,\u201d the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who, like the NBA store employee, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nThis can only end now with Kaepernick himself saying something about how the Uighur issue is \u201cmore complicated\u201d than people think. Not until every last social-justice warrior has been exposed as a moneygrubbing bootlicker will the NBA\u2019s China tornado dissipate.\n\nSpeaking of which, as enjoyable as it is to see most of these phonies revealed for who they really are, in a few cases it hurts. This one hurts:\n\n\u201cThey have billions of dollars at stake,\u201d [Charles] Barkley says. \u201cIt\u2019s a business decision. I understand the NBA. The players and the owners both got billions of dollars at stake.\u201d As for those who don\u2019t get it \u2026 he didn\u2019t hold back on ripping them, by calling them \u201cidiots and jackasses and fools.\u201d \u201cThe NBA makes billions of dollars in China and that goes to the owners and the players,\u201d Barkley added. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a business decision, and I totally understand it.\u201d\n\nOf all the likable bigmouthed personalities in sports, Barkley\u2019s the last whom I would have guessed would resort to China cuckery. He\u2019s too human and fundamentally American not to recoil at the idea of letting ChiCom money dictate what he, you, and I say about politics, particularly when what we\u2019re being asked not to say is that Hong Kongers deserve human rights.\n\nBut no, in the end, Sir Charles only cares about money too. Maybe he\u2019s a little too fundamentally American. Thus does the country\u2019s long love affair with Charles Barkley end tragically.\n\nHere he is commenting on the Dan Patrick Show this morning. Needless to say, NBA players don\u2019t need Barkley to remind them to protect their, and the league\u2019s, bottom lines. In case it wasn\u2019t clear enough this week that they had better shut their mouths going forward if they want the yuans to keep flowing, their agents are reportedly urging them to withhold comment on all things China when asked. Thus do some of the most aggressive capitalists in the American imagination, the flashy sharks nailing down nine-figure contracts for the likes of LeBron and Steph Curry, end up effectively deputized as capos for China\u2019s communist regime.", "description": "Woke.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
