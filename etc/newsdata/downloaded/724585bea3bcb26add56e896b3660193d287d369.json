Critics were outraged that the Gray Lady would put a whistleblower in danger and Jeong felt readers canceling their subscriptions in protest backed up \u201cdissenting views inside the paper about what it should do and be.\u201d\n\nCALLS TO CANCEL NEW YORK TIMES SUBSCRIPTIONS EMERGE OVER REPORT IDENTIFYING TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nThe media industry found it bizarre that an already divisive member of The Times\u2019 editorial board would defend a boycott of her own paper, but when liberal CNN asked for comment it was revealed that Jeong had already moved on last month.\n\n\u201cSarah decided to leave the editorial board in August,\u201d deputy editorial page editor Kate Kingsbury told the Times-friendly CNN in a Friday night news dump.\n\nThe New York Times did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for further comment.\n\nLast year, several derogatory tweets aimed at white people that Jeong sent in 2014 were unearthed when the Gray Lady announced she was joining the paper.\n\n\u201cOh man it's kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men,\u201d Jeong wrote in July 2014 in one of several old messages went viral.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJeong\u2019s Twitter feed was filled with a host of messages that could be construed as racist and offensive. She compared \u201cdumbass f-----g white people\u201d to dogs, said that \u201cold white men\u201d were \u201clemmings,\u201d opined that white people would \u201cgo extinct soon,\u201d and used the hashtag #CancelWhitePeople.\n\n\u201cAre white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins,\u201d she wrote in 2014 before adding a paragraph claiming that \u201cwhiteness\u201d resulted in being \u201cawful.\u201d\n\nDespite widespread outrage, The Times issued a statement declaring that it had reviewed her social media history during the hiring process and was standing by the decision to bring her aboard.\n\n\u201cWe hired Sarah Jeong because of the exceptional work she has done \u2026 her journalism and the fact that she is a young Asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment. For a period of time she responded to that harassment by imitating the rhetoric of her harassers,\u201d The Times said in a statement. \u201cShe regrets it, and The Times does not condone it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe paper said it had \u201ccandid conversations\u201d with Jeong during the interview process that included a \u201cthorough vetting\u201d and review of her social media history. The Times said it is \u201cconfident that she will be an important voice for the editorial board moving forward.\u201d\n\nJeong issued a statement that echoed The Times, saying that she was simply mimicking her online harassers. But roughly one year later, Jeong is off the editorial board and will reportedly work for the paper as a contracted contributor.\n\n\"I made the change so I can work on what I want to work on in the immediate moment,\u201d Jeong told CNN on Friday.\n\nFox News\u2019 Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "The New York Times quietly revealed that controversial writer Sarah Jeong, who once made headlines for mocking \u201cwhite people,\u201d was no longer part of its editorial board.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
