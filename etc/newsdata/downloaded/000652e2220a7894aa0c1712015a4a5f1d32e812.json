It\u2019s also damn near impossible to fault the performances of Michael B Jordan as Stevenson and Jamie Foxx as his client, both as good as they\u2019ve ever been. But instead it\u2019s director Destin Daniel Cretton, whose breakout indie Short Term 12 showed such promise, who can\u2019t quite rise to the material or his performers, choosing anonymity over ferocity, making the dullest, safest decision at every turn. It\u2019s not enough to topple the fascinating true story at his film\u2019s centre but it does have a frustrating, flattening effect.\n\nBryan Stevenson: the lawyer devoting his life to fighting injustice Read more\n\nStevenson, whose legend seems to rise with each year (most recently thanks to a HBO documentary), graduated from Harvard with a dream of making a difference. But unlike many of his peers, his idealism was focused on those at the very bottom of the food chain, death row inmates whom the system had deemed unworthy of due process. In the late 80s he started the Equal Justice Initiative to help right these wrongs and, in some cases, exonerate those who had been wrongly imprisoned.\n\nIn the film, he starts meeting prisoners and quickly discovers both the depth of the epidemic and his na\u00efvet\u00e9 over how much he can really achieve. When he hears about Walter \u201cJohnny D\u201d Macmillan, a man who claims he\u2019s been wrongfully accused of murder, he\u2019s appalled and engaged in equal amounts, inserting himself into the case even if Macmillan remains unsure. As he delves further and starts to construct enough evidence for a retrial, he finds the system unwilling to bend for the truth.\n\nThe mechanics of the plot might be familiar but the facts of Macmillan\u2019s case are so utterly infuriating that Stevenson\u2019s dogged search for justice remains involving throughout. As he explains late in the film, the racial profiling that led local authorities to pin a violent murder on Macmillan was, and depressingly still is, indicative of a system that de-prioritises people of colour and people living in poorer communities. The case became a blueprint of sorts for Stevenson and given how the specifics don\u2019t sound too dissimilar from cases 30 years on, there\u2019s poignant prescience in its retelling. The facts make us angry enough and so Creton and co-writer Andrew Lanham\u2019s decision to turn the film\u2019s vile bigots, led up by a hammy Rafe Spall, into cartoonish villains snarling from the wings has a hindering effect. It distracts from the reality of the case and of ongoing cases such as this, turning racists into pantomime bad guys rather than presenting them far more chillingly as real people who have normalised their hatred.\n\nThe film is far more successful in its portrayal of the good guys. As the woman who helped Stevenson set up his non-profit, Brie Larson is solid but it\u2019s the two men at the film\u2019s centre who truly steal our attention. Jordan\u2019s movie star credentials have been affirmed time and time again at this stage but it remains a joy to see him lead and here he dials back his trademark charm for a more understated turn that remains as effective as anything we\u2019ve seen him do. Stevenson believed in fairness above all else and the scenes that cut deepest are when we see Jordan\u2019s quiet outrage at how race tips the scale, for him and for those around him. His heroism is that much more effective because of the simplicity underpinning it and Jordan\u2019s performance. He\u2019s a man of the law who wants a just system, regardless of race and income, and it\u2019s humbling and stirring to see him try to achieve this. Foxx hasn\u2019t done much that\u2019s memorable for so long now that it\u2019s easy to forget just what an accomplished actor he is but he\u2019s excellent here, avoiding an overly mannered character bit and delivering a powerfully restrained portrait of a man who just wants to go home.\n\nBoth performances could well enter the awards race but the film suffers from Creton\u2019s workmanlike direction. The score, the cinematography, the film\u2019s overall feel \u2013 it didn\u2019t need to be this overwhelmingly average. I understand the need to allow the facts breathing space but still, a punchier, angrier, more confidently made film would have been possible without distracting from the truth.\n\nJust Mercy is a straightforward, no-frills drama that does have an undeniably emotive effect. The finale in particular, although it perhaps goes one big speech too far, is incredibly moving and the film\u2019s epilogue reminds you that Stevenson\u2019s brave, important work is sadly not over.", "description": "Full-blooded performances from Michael B Jordan and Jamie Foxx add weight to a powerful, if by-the-numbers fact-based tale", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24e8a0d7524f5c6dd4933dd470e40565107ee7f/126_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1da1fb947900e3eac5a89e43bfa1a346", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
