(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Democratic presidential debate (all times local):\n\n8 p.m.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are outlining their plans to address racism in the nation and attacking President Donald Trump as they do so.\n\nAt Thursday's Democratic presidential debate, Beto O'Rourke called Trump \"a mortal threat\" to people of color in this country as he calls on Congress to pass a bill giving reparations to the descendants of slaves.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro says white supremacy \"is a growing threat to this country,\" and he adds, \"we have to root it out.\"\n\nCory Booker says the nation must have the \"courage\" to call out systemic racism in the nation.\n\nAnd Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) says the nation's issues of systemic racism \" preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us.\"\n\nThe Democratic primary debate is being held at Texas Southern University, a historically black university.\n\n___\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nSome Democratic presidential candidates have called on their rivals to stop attacking one another as the debate over health care grew heated.\n\nTen candidates are meeting Thursday in Houston for the third presidential primary debate.\n\nThe night kicked off with sometimes-fiery exchanges about \"Medicare for All,\" the health care overhaul backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and some other candidates.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says it's too expensive. He wants to build on \"Obamacare\" to expand coverage to those who want it.\n\nAs former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of forgetting what he said moments earlier, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) interjected, saying, \"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar agreed, saying, \"A house divided cannot stand.\"\n\n___\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nFormer Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro has accused former Vice President Joe Biden of fumbling comments on his own health care reform plan.\n\nDuring Thursday's Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Castro said Biden was \"forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago\" when he claimed that 10 million people would not be left in a coverage gap under his health care reforms but would be automatically enrolled.\n\nCastro also said fact checks after a debate earlier this summer showed Biden's plan would leave out 3% of Americans, or about 10 million people.\n\nCastro says President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act vision \"was not to leave 10 million people uncovered.\"\n\nIn July's presidential debates, Castro criticized Biden for his role in immigration deportations under the Obama administration.\n\n___\n\n7:45 p.m.\n\nJoe Biden and Bernie Sanders are sharply battling over \"Medicare for All\" at Thursday's Democratic presidential debate in Houston.\n\nThe former vice president is accusing Sanders of being less than candid about \"how much it's going to cost the taxpayers\" to shift the nation to single-payer health insurance, particularly union members who made concessions to obtain better health insurance under the current system.\n\nBiden says, \"For a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\"\n\nWhen Sanders pushed back, invoking cancer treatment, Biden replied that \"I know a lot about cancer \u2014 it's personal to me.\" Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\n___\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is suggesting his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren is not being candid about the costs of her plan for the federal government to provide health care to all Americans.\n\nHe said Thursday at the third Democratic debate that \"This is about candor, honesty,\" suggesting Warren's plan to increase income taxes on wealthier Americans by 2% falls far short of the estimated $30 billion the plan would cost.\n\nBiden says it's not a bad idea if you like it. But he says, \"I don't like it.\"\n\nWarren is responding by saying people will pay premiums to the government instead of to health insurance companies, adding, \"I've never actually met anyone who likes their insurance company.\"\n\n___\n\n7:35 p.m.\n\nJoe Biden is evoking former President Barack Obama and his signature policy achievement as a contrast to rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden said Thursday during the third Democratic debate: \"I know the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack.\"", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are outlining their plans to address racism in the nation and attacking President Donald Trump as they do so.
