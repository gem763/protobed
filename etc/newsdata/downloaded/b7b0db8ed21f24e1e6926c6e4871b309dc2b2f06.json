We only managed to find a home for 16 beforehand, so had to leave thousands of mothers and babies behind. They will be trapped inside those cages for their entire lives, their only escape is when they are shipped off to a slaughterhouse to be murdered for their flesh and fur. Rabbits like these are also abused for animal testing, tortured for a lifetime before eventually getting murdered too. They are also regularly kept as \u2018pets\u2019 often in solitary confinement and inappropriate conditions suffering from boredom and multiple other health issues.\u201d\n\nMia added: \u201cWhat we do to the animals need to end immediately. This injustice has gone on far too long. We will continue to enter in these facilities to expose these horrors and liberate the beings trapped inside for as long as it takes. We are not going anywhere. Join us in our fight, be vegan, be active and let\u2019s put an end to this once and for all.\u201d\n\nClick for more from The New York Post.", "description": "A Barcelona-based vegan activist has harmed more animals than she tried to save thanks to her radical acts, according to a report.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
