Klimek, USA TODAY)\n\nA labor shortage is jeopardizing economic expansion in almost every state, putting pressure on lawmakers to find ways to attract more residents and coax people who have dropped out of the workforce to rejoin it.\n\nStates are offering financial incentives to entice prodigal natives to move home and raise families. They\u2019re also reaching out to discouraged workers who don\u2019t show up in the record-low unemployment rate because they\u2019ve given up seeking jobs. Among them: people with outdated skills, high-school dropouts and those with criminal records.\n\nIn 39 states, there are more jobs than people looking for them, according to a Stateline analysis of June hiring and employment data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNorth Carolina had the highest job openings rate, with 5.7% of all jobs unfilled. Missouri, North Dakota and Virginia were close behind at about 5.3%.\n\nIn Northern and Midwestern states such as Missouri and North Dakota, the labor pool is limited by slower population growth and a higher proportion of older residents.\n\nIn fast-growing Southern states such as North Carolina and Virginia, there aren\u2019t enough construction and health care workers to meet the needs of new residents.\n\nNationally the number of job openings in August was 7.1 million, compared with 6 million unemployed people looking for work, according to federal statistics.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929 was 90 years ago: Could it happen again?\n\n'Like watching the tide recede before a tsunami'\n\nTiffany Evans, who owns a construction business in Wilmington, North Carolina, said a decline in skilled immigrants, lack of interest in blue-collar jobs among young people, damage from Hurricane Florence last year and a continuing construction boom has dried up her labor supply and that of her subcontractors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like watching the tide recede before a tsunami. What can we do?\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you got 30 houses under contract and now it\u2019s taking three months before you can get guys to do the siding. It\u2019s a slow trickle of taking longer with less people.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is seeing \u201cthe most challenging hiring environment in recent memory,\u201d with half of businesses reporting hiring trouble in a state survey last year, up from less than 40% in 2016, said Andrew Berger-Gross, senior economist for the state Department of Commerce.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina takes this situation very seriously,\u201d said Berger-Gross, referring to efforts by the NCWorks Commission to support apprenticeships and training for existing workers to make them more productive.\n\nMakeup mogul: For Huda Kattan, beauty has become a $1.2 billion empire\n\nStates have two options to deal with labor shortages, said Ryan Nunn, policy director at the Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative of the Brookings Institution. The first is a \u201czero-sum game\u201d in which they compete with other states to attract the same workers. The second is a \u201cpositive sum\u201d response: making existing workers more productive by giving them new skills, and training new workers drawn from disadvantaged groups like prisoners and dropouts.\n\nStates with the highest rates of openings are developing programs for residents who never started looking for jobs again after the Great Recession, when there were more than six people looking for every open job. Despite many openings now, the share of people working or looking for jobs remains low compared with 2000.\n\nWhat's the cause?\n\nPart of the reason is the aging of baby boomers, but even among prime working-age people, a smaller share of black men and men without a high school diploma are looking for work, a study by Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia economists found.\n\nThat may be because of an increasing gap in pay between unskilled and skilled work, the study said, one reason why Missouri and North Dakota, among other states, are subsidizing college-level training for high-demand jobs.\n\n\u201cMissouri can\u2019t afford to squander a single potential worker by not giving them the skills they need,\u201d said Karen Buschmann, a vice president of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, which outlined plans to find workers in last year\u2019s Workforce 2030 report, which is the subject of a summit meeting this month including Republican Gov. Mike Parson.\n\nSome of the recommendations already have gone into new legislation, such as a bill signed by Parson in July to ease transfer of occupational licenses from other states, and to fund college training for people who need job skills. The report also suggests teaching more jobs skills to students starting in middle school, including making kids aware of good jobs they can get in manufacturing, technology and health care and how to qualify for them.\n\nUAW: More than 3,600 workers go on strike at Mack Truck plants in 3 states\n\nMissouri is one of many states, including North Dakota, that is trying to find jobs for former prisoners. A Manhattan Institute study in 2015 showed that ex-prisoners who get jobs quickly are less likely to commit new crimes.\n\nMissouri\u2019s Department of Corrections started helping prisoners near their release dates to prepare for the job market with interview suits, mock interviews and counseling about handling the inevitable questions about incarceration.\n\nIt worked out well for Michael Eanes, 48, a member of the first class of Missouri\u2019s Connections to Success program.\n\nSoon after his release last year after more than 23 years in prison on a drug charge with a mandatory minimum sentence, Eanes took a job as a peer counselor in a recovery clinic in Columbia.\n\n\u201cThirteen months out I\u2019ve got a job, a car, an apartment, a fiancee and a new daughter,\u201d said Eanes, who adopted the African name of Mataka Asari at the Algoa Correctional Center as a symbol of his reinvention. The skills he learned in Connections to Success helped him cope with employer questions and his own sense of trauma after spending half his life behind bars for selling cocaine to an undercover officer.\n\n\u201cAs a young black man coming up in St. Louis, we didn\u2019t talk about having emotional issues. We came from a culture where you stand up and be strong and push through it,\u201d Eanes said. \u201cIt behooves the community for people who are coming out to have an easier path to productive citizenship.\u201d\n\nDemocratic race: Think \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 is the only health plan? Think again\n\n'We need more help'\n\nNorth Dakota also is planning a series of moves in the 2020 legislative session to lure workers. High on the list is providing money for nurse and health care technician training, as well as job training for prisoners before release.\n\nNorth Dakota state Rep. Jim Grueneich, a Republican who sponsored a bill signed into law in April to fund more college-level job training, said employers all over the state need more skilled employees.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where I go. Everybody is crying the same thing: \u2018We need more help,\u2019\u201d Grueneich said. \u201cWe need electricians and plumbers and truck drivers. There\u2019s a mindset that you need a master\u2019s degree, but our people are getting those degrees and coming back and working in the trades.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota also wants more people to come back home. State officials hope to attract them with incentives and license transfer agreements with other states, Commerce Commissioner Michelle Kommer said.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is people who have left North Dakota coming back after seven or eight years of being away,\u201d Kommer said. \u201cThey are familiar with our climate, their families are here, and it\u2019s a great place to raise a family.\u201d\n\nThe state has a history of labor shortages, most recently during the boomtown period of oil patch growth in the mid-2010s, when makeshift worker camps surrounded oil wells and even high school dropouts could get well-paying jobs.\n\nAutomation on the way\n\nToday\u2019s energy jobs are more automated and require more technical skill, the so-called gold collar jobs that combine manual labor with the technical skill to run machines, Kommer said.\n\n\u201cYou will get your hands dirty doing these jobs,\u201d Kommer said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also well-paying and more technical. Today\u2019s energy job might be sitting in a big bright room operating a machine, but technically it\u2019s a welding job.\u201d\n\nWith two years of training, a beginner can start at $55,000 a year in such energy-related jobs and quickly move up to $90,000 after gaining experience, she said.\n\nSuch automation is likely the ultimate solution to labor shortages, said Srikant Devaraj, a research economist who studies Midwestern regional economic trends at the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.\n\nFor that reason, states should prepare for the next downturn, when cost-cutting will inevitably lead to growth in unemployment, Devaraj said.\n\n\u201cThe Great Lakes states are all about manual labor. When companies want to cut their costs, the obvious way is to cut labor costs,\u201d Devaraj said. \u201cAutomation will bring the need for new skill sets, and this should be taught in schools. When machines are doing more work, there will be a high demand for people who can fix the machines.\u201d\n\nStory via Stateline, an initiative of The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/15/labor-shortage-more-jobs-than-people-looking-them-most-states/3974954002/", "description": "In 39 states, there are more jobs than people looking for them, according to a\u00a0Stateline\u00a0analysis of June hiring and employment data.", "authors": ["Tim Henderson", "Published A.M.
