But even stronger winds were expected to return Tuesday night and pummel the region throughout the day Wednesday. A combination of single-digit humidity and gusts reaching 80 mph could swiftly bring back tinderbox conditions, as The Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang reported.\n\nThe mayor described the work ahead for emergency crews as a race against the clock.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe hope to make deep progress over the next 24 hours, because we need that progress before Wednesday,\u201d Garcetti said earlier in the day. \u201cWednesday is when we have those Santa Anas blowing even stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do feel like we\u2019re getting our arms around this, but with the big caveat that the wrong gust, air that comes in from the wrong direction, could lift embers and immediately make this a fire someplace else,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when people say, \u2018Hey, I feel like my home is far away from where this fire is\u2019 \u2014 do not return, for your own safety. Trust the fire department. Trust the professionals to do this, and don\u2019t be a hero.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe National Weather Service said it expects the next wave of Santa Anas to be \u201cthe strongest we have seen so far this season.\u201d An \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning will be in effect for the Los Angeles area from 11 p.m. Tuesday through 6 p.m. Thursday local time, meaning fires could spread rapidly during that time and behave in a way that makes them difficult to control.\n\nAD\n\nThe fire broke out around 1:30 a.m. on the west side of Interstate 405 in an area known as the Sepulveda Pass, near the Getty Center museum, prompting mandatory evacuations in an area with more than 10,000 residential and commercial buildings.\n\nRoughly 1,100 regional firefighters were battling the \u201cvery dynamic\u201d blaze from land and sky as it headed west into forested land, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Three recreation centers were housing evacuees.\n\nAD\n\nEight homes were destroyed in the blaze and six others were damaged, officials said.\n\nFirefighters \u201cwere literally overwhelmed,\u201d Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters. \u201cThey had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect. Many times, it depends on where the ember lands.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Southern California blaze joins the massive Kincade Fire, which is marching through more than 66,000 acres of wine country at the other end of the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a statewide emergency.\n\nTerrazas warned people to act quickly if they were in the evacuation zone for the Getty Fire. He noted that the Los Angeles area has experienced several major fires in recent weeks because of strengthened Santa Ana winds and a lack of rain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous season right now,\u201d Terrazas said.\n\nAD\n\nStudents on the Chalon Campus of Mount St. Mary\u2019s University, in the evacuation zone, left campus overnight and are staying on the Doheny Campus, near downtown Los Angeles. Flames, smoke and ash were visible from campus, according to a Twitter user who identified herself as a resident.\n\nAD\n\nSome celebrities tweeted about being evacuated. Los Angeles Lakers player LeBron James wrote that he and his family drove around trying to find somewhere to stay before finally ending up at a place that could accommodate them. Clark Gregg, an actor in several Marvel films, said he and his dogs evacuated to a hotel room. Actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was evacuated at 3:30 a.m. and urged people in evacuation zones not to \u201cscrew around.\u201d\n\nThe University of California at Los Angeles and several public schools in the area were closed because of the blaze.\n\nAD\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses visual arts exhibitions, was untouched by the fire but was closed Monday as the blaze approached the edges of the campus. The carefully designed museum has a sophisticated air-filtration system to block pollution, a million-gallon reserve water tank and an evacuation plan, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2017.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany have asked about the art \u2014 it is protected by state-of-the-art technology,\u201d the museum tweeted around 8:30 a.m. \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d\n\nThe #GettyFire is now moving down the hillside towards the 405 Fwy. I\u2019m all the way on the northbound side, and I can feel the heat from the flames! @CBSLA pic.twitter.com/02bE4VcWNo \u2014 Tina Patel (@tina_patel) October 28, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The fast-moving brush fire broke out around 2:30 a.m. and a few hours later had spread across 500 acres.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/93ZHQ4hXbBtfzWbMnRHZHNt8Y3A=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-28-2019/t_f04f18a2446d425e81d9c7cc6a68b6bf_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_29_00_Still015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
