Industries aren\u2019t assemblages of Lego blocks that can be taken apart and reassembled according to a clever new design. They are complex and evolving ecosystems, organized around scores of institutions, hundreds of laws, thousands of personalities, millions of relationships, and a potentially limitless number of ideas.\n\nWhat will happen to the real human beings whose lives and careers will be upended or derailed while the mandarins of the Warren administration try to figure things out? Will President Warren have contingency plans for her ever-proliferating plans when \u2014 as they inevitably will \u2014 things don\u2019t go according to plan?\n\nOf course she won\u2019t. She won\u2019t because she can\u2019t; she can\u2019t because the central flaw of every economic plan is the plan itself. That\u2019s the lesson of the 20th century, and it\u2019s why Warren\u2019s critics aren\u2019t totally off the mark in accusing her of being a socialist \u2014 not in intent, but in mentality. Those with plans for everything prove only that they can\u2019t be trusted to plan for anything.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bret Stephens", "Nytimes.Com Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
