They were last down about 1.7% at $219.17 in afternoon trading.\n\nA spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs said the bank declined to comment on the matter beyond what was stated in the analyst\u2019s note.", "description": "Apple Inc on Friday disputed a Goldman Sachs research note which stated that the company's plans to account for the trial of its new streaming service Apple TV+ will have a \"material negative impact\" on its results.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429545126&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C234-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
