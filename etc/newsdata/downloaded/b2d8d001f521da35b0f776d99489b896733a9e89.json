While many politicians and civil rights leaders pushed back on a police attempt to stem the demonstrations, Thursday morning\u2019s targeting of the London Underground soured some previously supportive leaders.\n\nCommuters now physically dragging protestors from the roof of the train. @itvlondon pic.twitter.com/gDkXfJNxmL \u2014 Holly Collins (@HollyJoCollins) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cThis illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to word,\u201d London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement early Thursday morning. \u201cIt is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.\u201d\n\nBut protesting within the law has become increasingly difficult in London, where the Metropolitan Police Service issued an edict on Monday banning Extinction Rebellion demonstrations within the city. More than 1,600 people with connections to the protest group have been arrested in the last week. Protesters defied the police order to hold a \u201cnurse-in\u201d in front of Google\u2019s London offices, where mothers breast-fed their babies and held a banner that read: \u201cYouTube, Stop Platforming Climate Denial,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExtinction Rebellion has planned disruptive actions worldwide, blocking traffic, gluing themselves to bridges, posing nearly-naked in legislative chambers, and pouring red paint over Wall Street\u2019s famous bull statue, a symbol of capitalism and the free market economy. In April, more than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion supporters were arrested in climate protests around the world. Activists who identify as members of the movement have popped up in the New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam. The protesters say they want faster action from governments to address climate change across the globe.\n\nEarly Thursday, climate activists stalled subway operations in Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell stations, all on the eastern side of London. British Transport Police said in a statement on Twitter that officers had made four arrests and sent a specialist team to the Shadwell Docklands light rail station to remove four more.\n\n\u201cOur message to [Extinction Rebellion],\u201d the transportation police agency said in a tweet Wednesday night, \u201cDisrupting Tube service in London could be dangerous. We are urging protesters to seriously reconsider these plans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral city officials and U.K. politicians have weighed in on the protests, some noting the odd juxtaposition of climate activists blocking one of the most sustainable modes of transportation in London.\n\n\u201cWe are really disappointed that they have since announced fresh action on the London Underground network,\u201d said BTP Assistant Chief Constable Sean O\u2019Callaghan in a statement. \u201cThe Tube and rail networks are one of the greenest transport methods in London, any action goes against what they campaign for and will only cause misery for London\u2019s commuters.\u201d\n\n#ExtinctionRebellion activists have disrupted London\u2019s Docklands Light Railway network at Shadwell station pic.twitter.com/txqJcYJpMA \u2014 Damien Gayle (@damiengayle) October 17, 2019\n\nAt least one spokesman for Extinction Rebellion recognized the potential for negative results from Thursday\u2019s protest. Fergal McEntee, who often speaks on behalf of the group, told a London radio host the protests were a \u201chuge own goal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nClare Farrell, one of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-founders, defended the action.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is what you do when you think that absolutely everything is at stake,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cWhat would you do if you knew your children were in a burning building, well you would break down the door, wouldn\u2019t you? It wouldn\u2019t be pretty, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it in a way that everyone said that was nice and calm, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with The Washington Post, she explained how the group debated a similar style protest with a commuter train in April. At that time, a man in his 80s stopped a train in London\u2019s financial district when he sat on top of it, eating a sandwich.\n\nAD\n\nThe group responded to early criticism by supporting its tactics.\n\n\u201cAs with Extinction Rebellion actions that block roads, the action is intended to cause economic disruption and thereby convince the Government to agree to Extinction Rebellion UK\u2019s three demands of telling the truth, acting now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, plus creating and be led by the decisions of a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on climate and ecological justice,\u201d the climate activists said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nAD\n\nSome Green Party and Labour Party politicians have pushed back on the police for issuing a blanket ban on the group\u2019s protests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCivil liberties are being brushed aside in the ludicrous crackdown on [Extinction Rebellion] protests,\u201d Brighton Pavilion Member of Parliament Caroline Lucas, a member of the Green Party, said on Twitter.\n\nDiane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and a Labour Party politician, tweeted: \u201cThis ban is completely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion threatened legal action Tuesday if the Metropolitan Police enforced the protest ban, challenging the rule against all Extinction Rebellion protests.\n\nOther British politicians backed the police. The Conservative Party\u2019s Priti Patel, Britain\u2019s home secretary and a member of Parliament for Witham, tweeted her support on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOfficers from around the country have done a fantastic job policing [Extinction Rebellion] protests,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSupporting our Police is vital. Labour support the law breakers who have disrupted the lives and businesses of Londoners. They cannot be trusted in Downing Street or the Home Office.\u201d\n\nDespite the police crackdown, the protest group has vowed to continue its week-long protests in London.\n\n\u201cActivists are willing to go to prison in order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity,\u201d Extinction Rebellion said in its statement.\n\nKarla Adam in London contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cActivists are willing to go to prison in order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity,\u201d Extinction Rebellion said in a statement.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5_FKrK3upudXj0Q25NzTesU7g5o=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_27d26b276b324cf99c0b8103f520bb23_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_17_at_4_44_53_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
