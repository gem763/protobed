Housing could be similarly adaptable, whether residents want to change their structures often or simply live in more unconventional dwellings.\n\n\u201cThings could be on wheels like the shed, or you could have flexible spaces, adaptable spaces, perhaps buildings which are modular and you could shrink them down when you need to,\u201d he says. To Richard, a city that embraces the possibilities of parasitic architecture is one that could free architects and inhabitants alike to play with their idea of home.\n\nTeresa Bardzi\u0144ska-Bonenberg, an architectural historian at Poland\u2019s University of Arts in Pozna\u0144, has studied parasitic architecture. She says that the growing number of heritage-listed buildings in city centres that can\u2019t be altered, combined with skyrocketing rent prices and diminishing real estate inventory, has forced architects to become imaginative with new projects in urban areas.\n\nAt the same time, she points to an increasing desire for homes that occupants can easily and cheaply revamp and remix. \u201cThis is what the idea of \u2018parasiting\u2019 the city is about,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have now much more inspiration, materials, tools and courage to express themselves.\u201d", "description": "As urban centres face housing shortages and skyrocketing prices, parasitic structures could open the door to a whole new way of living in cities.", "authors": ["Erica X Eisen"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7n/j0/p07nj09q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
