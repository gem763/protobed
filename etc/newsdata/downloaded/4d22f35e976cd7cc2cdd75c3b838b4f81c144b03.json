And you know, I've always had a good relationship with Justin. I just don't know what to tell you.\"", "description": "Old photos of Justin Trudeau in blackface roiled Canada's federal election campaign this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nxjym.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
