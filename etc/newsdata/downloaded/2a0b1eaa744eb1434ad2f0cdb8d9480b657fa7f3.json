Now, the superstar quarterback is checking downfield and throwing the ball away on his support, tacit or otherwise, for the troubled wide receiver.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSpeaking during his weekly radio appearance with Westwood One\u2019s Jim Gray, it was Brady, evasive at times, who sought distance about his alleged endorsement of Brown. The Patriots cut Brown last week amidst an ongoing investigation alleging that the NFL star had committed multiple acts of rape. The tipping point appeared to be recent text messages, sent since Brown had signed with the Patriots in early September, whereby the player appeared to be threatening one of his accusers.\n\nAfter Brown was signed, Brady talked about the possibilities of the offense with the addition of the All-Pro wide receiver, saying \u201cWe\u2019re all excited to have him.\u201d Brady also offered to let Brown stay in the guest quarters of his home to help him acclimate to the area. Perhaps it was a genuine offer of hospitality, or perhaps it was to keep an eye on the troubled star.\n\nReports also indicated that Brady was \u201ca million percent in\u201d on Brown and endorsed the free-agent signing to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and that he, along with head coach Bill Belichick, opposed the release of Brown after just one game played. Brown was signed to a one-year, $15 million contract by the Patriots that included a second-year option held by the team.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s always reports and speculation about a lot of things that I have said or have not said or been a part of,\u201d Brady said in his interview with Gray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reality is [that] I don\u2019t make any personnel decisions. I don\u2019t decide to sign players, I don\u2019t decide to trade them, I don\u2019t decide to release them [and] I don\u2019t decide to draft them \u2013 I don\u2019t get asked. I just show up and do my job, I\u2019m an employee like everyone else. I\u2019m going to show up this week and do the best I can do as a quarterback.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps diplomatic cover from Brady, who undoubtedly wields a certain level of power with the Patriots organization. When the Patriots traded Jimmy Garoppolo in 2017, it was alleged that Brady was pulling the strings to get the backup quarterback out of Foxboro. If this is true, and the organization has denied this, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise then if Brady lobbied for the signing of Brown or endorsed the move.\n\nBrady was obviously enthralled by the idea of adding Brown -- a four-time All-Pro selection who has twice led the NFL in receiving yards during his nine years in the league -- to the offense. With wide receiver Julian Edelman banged up, the Patriots head into a Week 4 matchup with the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\u201cAgain, no one is going to be feeling sorry for the Patriots, nor should they,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019m going to go out [there] and try to do it with whoever is out there and do it the best way I possibly can.\u201d", "description": "Tom Brady, who once sounded excited about the Patriots signing Antonio Brown, now sounds despondent after the star wide receiver was cut.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/GettyImages-481170359.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
