On Monday, the company disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting US voters on Instagram, which Facebook owns.\n\n\"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Waters told Zuckerberg.\n\nLibra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners, including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay, have abandoned the project.\n\nThe Facebook CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. That scandal damaged Facebook's image in Washington and has compounded worries among lawmakers that the social media giant cannot be trusted to launch a global digital currency for its 2.4 billion users.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged Facebook's mistakes but said they should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland, arguing that the digital currency would help reduce the cost of global payments.\n\n\"I get that I'm not the ideal messenger for this right now, [as] we've faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I'm sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,\" he said.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the Libra project, testified before the committee in July. He told reporters last week that Zuckerberg will be unable to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project.\n\nOn October 14, the 21-member Libra Association agreed on articles of association laying out how the organisation will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots.\n\nWednesday's hearing in the US Congress is also likely to address antitrust concerns after 46 attorneys general joined a New York-led antitrust investigation of Facebook, officials announced Tuesday, ramping up a bipartisan probe that could force an overhaul of the technology giant's business.\n\nLawmakers are also likely to touch on other hot-button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March that are still pending and that allege Facebook violated fair lending laws.", "description": "Zuckerberg tells US lawmakers Facebook won't back any move by Libra until it has satisfied all US regulatory concerns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/38bc50e2b9144f21af41672609a9470b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
