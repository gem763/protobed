He said he will go into the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ending on Oct. 30 asking whether still more accommodative policy is needed after two straight rate cuts.\n\nA number of other Fed officials will be speaking, including Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 04:11 ET (08:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
