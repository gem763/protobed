The economy grew 0.1% in April-June - the slowest annual growth since 2009's second quarter, when it fell 1.2%.\n\nLike many other export-reliant Asian economies, Singapore has been hit hard by cooling global demand and the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, which has disrupted world supply chains in a blow to business investment and corporate profits.\n\nThe city-state's manufacturing sector has suffered particularly, buffeted by the trade tensions and a cyclical downturn in the electronics sector.\n\nAll 11 economists polled by Reuters last week are expecting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to ease monetary policy at its semiannual meeting on Oct. 14, the same day third-quarter GDP is announced.\n\nThe Singapore government is also expected to roll out a generous budget ahead of an election next year as the ruling party seeks to appease voters who are feeling the pinch from the economic downturn.", "description": "Singapore seen narrowly dodging recession in third quarter, central bank to ease", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF960AD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
