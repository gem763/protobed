The 120-ton vessels can poke around at eleven knots (thirteen miles per hour) and each carry two 533-millimeter torpedoes. All in all, shallow littoral waters are very favorable for mini-submarine operations, with interference from rocky shallows and loud surf reducing sonar detection ranges and giving mini submarines abundant opportunities to hide and wait in ambush. On the high end of the capability spectrum, Iran operates three much larger and more capable Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines purchased from Russia in the 1990s. These can comfortably hunt in the waters of the Indian Ocean.\n\nRecommended: Could the Battleship Make a Comeback?\n\nFour years ago, Iran also launched its own domestically built Fateh-class submarine. The homemade vessel may lack modern features such as antiship missiles or quiet Air Independent Propulsion system, but it does seem to be the genuine article\u2014not something one should take for granted with reports of new Iranian weapons.\n\nRecommended: 5 Worst Generals in U.S. History\n\nWhy would Iran invest considerable sums in building its own submarines instead of shelling out for off-the-shelf hardware in Russia or China?\n\nThe reason is doubtlessly related to Tehran\u2019s jarring education in how shifting international alliances can throw defense planning askew. Prior to the Iranian Revolution, the government of the shah was lavished with large quantities of top-shelf U.S. weapons, which became rather difficult to maintain after that one little incident in the 1979 involving the American embassy. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Tehran found itself on the outs with both America and the Soviet Union, and turned to the Chinese for arms\u2014as well as backdoor dealings with Reagan administration officials.\n\nRecommended: 5 Reasons No Nation Wants to Go to War with Israel\n\nThis tumultuous history has created a tremendous impetus for military self-sufficiency in Iran, even if the results in the short term are nothing special compared to extant foreign weapon systems.\n\n(This first appeared in the summer.)\n\nThe \u201csemi-heavy\u201d Fateh (\u201cConqueror\u201d) measures between forty and forty-eight meters long, and is claimed to displace about six hundred tons submerged\u2014putting it in a similar weight class as the small German Type 205 and 206 coastal defense submarines launched in the 1960s and \u201970s. It appears to be an elongated version of the Iranian-built Nahang, an unarmed prototype that may currently be serving as a special-operations submarine. Fateh has four bow torpedo tubes with likely access to six to eight reloads, with a circular sonar array situated under the tubes.\n\nFateh can operate up to two hundred meters below the surface\u2014more than adequate for the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. Sources variously place its maximum speed while submerged at between fourteen and twenty-three knots (sixteen to twenty-six miles per hour), with the lower estimate seeming more likely. The Fars news agency claims that Fateh can also operate up to five weeks at sea at a range of up to 3,100 miles, giving it the endurance to venture further afield into the Arabian Sea. However, it\u2019s less clear how long the diesel-electric submarine can sustainably swim underwater without surfacing or snorkeling to recharge batteries.\n\nYou can see some media footage of Fateh in the clip below, including what appear to be deck plans at the two-second mark and the interior of the vessel at thirteen seconds. The website Covert Shores also offers a detailed analysis of the imagery here.\n\nDespite being launched from the Bostanu shipyards in 2013, Fateh still appears to be undergoing sea trials and has yet to be declared fully operational.
