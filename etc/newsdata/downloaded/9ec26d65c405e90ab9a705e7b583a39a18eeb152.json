The fund will begin to be wound up on January 17. That is when money should start to be returned to investors. But savers face a long wait before they get all their money back. And they are likely to get back far less than they put in. Income Focus This fund was frozen yesterday, stopping savers from accessing their money. Administrators Link say they will update investors within two weeks. Until that update, it is unclear when savers will get their money back. Patient Capital Trust The trust trades on the stock market. This means that investors can buy or sell at any time. But with shares at a record low, savers face heavy losses.\n\n\u2018Smaller investors rely on a regulatory system that is letting them down. You have to wonder where the regulator was in all this \u2013 asleep at the wheel, it seems.\n\nWhy does the Financial Conduct Authority not have powers to stop a manager taking fees in a situation like this?\u2019\n\nJustin Modray, of Candid Financial Advice, added: \u2018Woodford really alienated investors by charging management fees on a fund suspended because of his own poor judgement.\u2019\n\nLink\u2019s decision to fire the fallen manager has caused his empire, Woodford Investment Management, to crumble.\n\nAsset managers Blackrock and Park Hill have been appointed to wind up the Equity Income fund, selling assets and returning money to investors.\n\nWoodford resigned as manager of his two other funds, Income Focus and the Patient Capital Trust, and decided to shut down his firm.\n\nThe downfall of Britain\u2019s most famous fund manager follows years of dismal performance.\n\nThe Equity Income fund saw its value peak at \u00a310.2billion in June 2017 but is now worth just \u00a33billion.\n\nIncome Focus has seen its value fall from \u00a3747million to \u00a3253million while shares in Patient Capital have fallen 73 per cent.\n\nHe has a six-month notice period to work through at the Income Focus fund. If he remains manager for all of that time, investors will pay him another \u00a3900,000 in fees.\n\nLink is hoping to hammer out a deal to decide the future of the Income Focus fund within the next 13 days.", "description": "In yet another insult to investors who trusted the once-feted fund manager with their money, the 59-year-old is taking \u00a35,000 a day from customers with savings in the Woodford Income Focus fund.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
