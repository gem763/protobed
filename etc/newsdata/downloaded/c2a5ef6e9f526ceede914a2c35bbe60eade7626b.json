Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nThe 2010 film The Social Network was almost entirely made up out of whole cloth, but one point made early in the film continues to ring true. Facebook has long had an obsessive focus with keeping the site up no matter what strain its servers were under, out of sheer competitive fear that users who couldn\u2019t access the site would turn elsewhere and never return.\n\nThat focus on keeping the site up helped Facebook to be competitive in its early years, when rivals like Twitter were routinely sidelined by melting servers. But this year, well into Facebook\u2019s decade of dominance, things have taken a turn for the worse. In July, the company experienced a day-long outage across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That followed the company\u2019s worst-ever outage in March, which lasted more than 24 hours.\n\nAs I wrote here in July, outages like these are becoming more serious. As Facebook increasingly positions itself as a core part of the world\u2019s communications infrastructure, a day-long outage can have serious consequences \u2014 especially if one were to take place during a catastrophe.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on?\n\nIn July, Facebook\u2019s official explanation for that outage was that routine maintenance had \u201ctriggered an issue.\u201d The full story is more interesting \u2014 and Mark Zuckerberg shared it with employees during some of the leaked audio that we began sharing here last week. So today, here\u2019s the full explanation why Facebook keeps going down. Of note here: the basic answer is that Facebook\u2019s massive size means that even small changes have hugely unpredictable effects, and can bring down the entire network.\n\nSo here\u2019s Zuckerberg\u2019s answer in full. He\u2019s joined on stage part way through by Santosh Janardhan, vice president of engineering. The answer is highly technical \u2014 and involves terms like \u201cstorm testing,\u201d \u201ctraffic drains,\u201d and \u201cslope testing\u201d for which Google offers little explanation. But the basic answer is clear: Facebook ran some tests, and the tests knocked the system over. (The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.)\n\nQuestion: We had several major outages this half. Is our reliability becoming a problem? What is the overarching root cause and how can we fix that?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I\u2019m glad that this is the top question, because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about a bunch. We\u2019ve had more downtime this year than the last few years combined. And it is an issue, and especially as we move towards more services in the private social platform area around messaging, that\u2019s such a core utility to people that it\u2019s really important that these services are reliable. Even from just a competition standpoint, what we see is that when we have downtimes in WhatsApp or Instagram Direct, there are people who just don\u2019t come back. They may move their messaging behavior over to iMessage or Telegram or whatever the service is and that\u2019s kind of it.\n\nAnd then it takes months to fight and earn back people\u2019s trust and usage of our services. So yes, it\u2019s a big deal. We\u2019re doing worse on this now than we were before. We need to focus more on this ... There have been a few different outages recently ... But at a high level they come from different areas. So it\u2019s not that there\u2019s one technical being, except that just the complexity of the systems is growing. So things that previously would have just been a blip are now things that are causing systems to fall over, and we\u2019re going to need to change the way that we react to that and change, focus a little bit more on reliability in the systems that we\u2019re engineering. So this is going to be more of a focus. We have to get this right. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s currently in a very bad place, but it\u2019s certainly trending worse than it should be. And we need to make sure we do better on this.\n\nSantosh Janardhan: I\u2019ll add some color to what Mark was saying. First off, I do want to make sure everybody relaxes. We take this very, very seriously. Now if you think about how we run the site, one of the things we end up doing frequently is that we do a lot of testing. ... Things like this help us understand the limits of the system and help us make the service a lot more resilient.\n\n... One of the risks that we run when we run these tests is that we risk pushing our system just a little over the edge so that it fails in ways that we didn\u2019t anticipate or plan for. Now this is exactly what happened last week. We were running a load test on \u2026 one of our biggest data centers. And we just pushed it over the edge, in our store which is where we store our photos, our videos, our Messenger attachments, your stickers, things of that nature. And it went into a series of cascading failures.\n\nNow when this happens the recovery becomes long, complex, and the mitigation takes time, which is what ended up happening. I want to touch a little bit on the reliability theme that Mark was alluding to. We will do the short-term things here, do the logs, errors, graphs, put together an error or two and fix the technical issues in the short term. What we are grappling at this point is, are you coming to an inflection point in complexity that ... We\u2019re still thinking through how to approach things.\n\nFor example, in the outage that happened last week, some of our tools and monitors that are designed to help us exactly deal with this actually failed us. They prolonged the outage. ... So we are dealing with a little different beast at this point. So what are we going to do about this? Two different work streams.\n\nOne is that we\u2019re going to do something to literally tackle complexity. We\u2019re going to create and augment new tools. We\u2019re going to do failure testing so that we identify the dependency graphs and run a bunch of bugs. Second is, actually, we want our teams to focus more on what I call fast and graceful recovery. This is something that we have not focused on before. And the last thing here is that this is going to take a little bit of time. We arguably, if you look at across our family of apps, are probably running the busiest online destination on the planet right now. So busy. And many have to tackle complexity that at the same time keep the site humming along. This is going to take some orchestration. We\u2019ll get there. Just bear with us.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0fTrending up: Microsoft successfully thwarted an effort by the government of Iran to hack into the email accounts of the Trump campaign.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fTrending down: Facebook\u2019s Libra initiative appears to be on the rocks after PayPal pulled out. The announcement hit especially hard given that David Marcus, who is running Libra for Facebook, was the top executive at PayPal before coming to Facebook.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50Facebook shut down 200 accounts associated with coordinated inauthentic behavior targeting Iran and Qatar. The accounts appeared to be professionally run by PR firms based in the Middle East and Africa. The company released a statement about the operations, noting they were focused on spreading propaganda and political news. Jane Lytvynenko and Logan McDonald report at BuzzFeed:\n\nThe UAE\u2013Nigeria network spent close to $150,000 promoting its content on Facebook, and attracted close to 1.4 million followers for the associated pages, according to the Facebook announcement. The Instagram profiles were followed by nearly 70,000 people. The action by Facebook today reinforces how malicious actors work across different platforms, run by different companies, to create coordinated disinformation operations, and can remain active even after major platforms take action against them. The UAE\u2013Egypt\u2013Nigeria network also demonstrates how outsourcing of digital trolling to marketing and PR firms is an increasingly popular way to conceal who\u2019s behind information operations.\n\nMicrosoft said hackers backed by the Iranian government tried to gain access to the email accounts of people involved in the Trump campaign, to influence the 2020 election. The company released a statement about the hacks, noting only four accounts were successfully compromised. (Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger / The New York Times)\n\nThe debate over net neutrality (whether internet providers should have to treat traffic from all sites equally) was shaped by a groundswell of online comments \u2014 many of which turned out to be fake. A BuzzFeed investigation revealed the decision to scrap the Obama-era rule was shaped in part by a massive manipulation campaign involving political impersonation. (Jeremy Singer-Vine and Kevin Collier / BuzzFeed)\n\nRudy Giuliani was briefly kicked off Twitter for tweeting a Ukrainian official\u2019s phone number, essentially doxing him. Twitter said the tweet violated its policy on sharing private information. (Makena Kelly / The Verge)\n\nSomeone tried to hack into Voatz, an app that lets soldiers from West Virginia vote overseas. An FBI investigation is ongoing, but it looks like the culprit might\u2019ve been a student researching security vulnerabilities in the app rather than trying to change votes.

In a series of Facebook ads showing Zuckerberg\u2019s face, Warren\u2019s campaign wrote \u201cMark Zuckerberg considers me an \u2018existential\u2019 threat to Facebook.\u201d (Taylor Hatmaker / The Daily Beast)\n\nA new study shows 62% of Americans think social media companies have too much control over the news, and 55% think their efforts result in worse news offerings for users. Unsurprisingly, Republicans are the most skeptical, according to Pew Research Center.

(Li Yuan / The New York Times)\n\nContrary to popular belief, the vast majority of deepfakes are pornographic, not political, in nature according to a study from cybersecurity firm Deeptrace. Almost all of them explicitly target women. (Joseph Cox / Vice)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is trying to fix both those problems with two new laws aimed at deepfakes. The first, AB 730, makes it illegal to distribute political deepfakes within 60 days of an election. The second, AB 602, gives Californians the right to sue someone who creates deepfakes that place them in pornographic material without consent.

(Andrew Marantz / The New York Times)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 PayPal pulled out of the Libra Association \u2014 the nonprofit association that governs Facebook\u2019s planned cryptocurrency. The news comes amid reports that Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe are also considering withdrawing their support. Nick Statt has a spicy quote from Libra\u2019s policy and communications head at The Verge:\n\nLater on in the evening, Facebook\u2019s communications team sent along another statement from Disparte, in which the blockchain project\u2019s policy chief appears to criticize PayPal for not having the \u201cfortitude\u201d to stick with something as difficult and demanding as Libra. \u201cIt requires a certain boldness and fortitude to take on an endeavor as ambitious as Libra \u2014 a generational opportunity to get things right and improve financial inclusion,\u201d Disparte writes. \u201cThe journey will be long and challenging. The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Facebook should never have developed Libra at all. \u201cA private company shouldn\u2019t be looking to gain power this way,\u201d Cook told a French newspaper. (Nick Statt / The Verge)\n\nElsewhere, Cook has been cozying up to Trump to score policy victories. Recently, the Apple CEO was able to get iPhones exempted from steep tariffs. He\u2019s also as an adviser to the administration\u2019s workforce policy board, but hasn\u2019t faced the backlash for this that other executives have.

The move could help Google compete with TikTok, though Firework is aimed at a slightly older audience. (Georgia Wells and Rob Copeland / The Wall Street Journal)\n\nTikTok has been paying some influencers to create posts and share them on other social networks. The Indian government is investigating whether the company\u2019s approach violated Indian laws around editorial influence on works for hire.

I think it\u2019s fair to say that Quiz Daddy\u2019s new show doesn\u2019t have quite the same buzz about it. But then, neither does HQ. (Jacob Feldman / Sports Illustrated)\n\nLele Pons is credited with coining the phrase \u201cdo it for the Vine\u201d on that now-defunct product. Now, she\u2019s a successful influencer on Instagram and YouTube, exemplifying a specific type of social media personality that\u2019s bubbly but also generic. (Sarah Ellison / The Washington Post)\n\nTyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins says he left Twitch because the Amazon-owned streaming service placed too many restrictions on the brand deals he could cut elsewhere. Blevins moved to Microsoft-owned Mixer in August. He\u2019s since scored deals with companies like Adidas and has a small role in Ryan Reynolds\u2019 new movie, Free Guy. (Julia Alexander / The Verge)\n\nAnd finally...\n\nThe FBI is running Facebook ads targeting Russians in Washington\n\nHere are just two perfect sentences from Donie O\u2019Sullivan and David Shortell at CNN:\n\nThe FBI is running ads on Facebook in the Washington DC area seemingly designed to target and recruit Russian spies as well as those who know about their work, CNN has learned. One ad seen by CNN features a stock photo of a young woman at her graduation with her family. Russian text overlaid on the image reads, \u201cFor your future, for the future of your family.\u201d\n\nTalk about turnabout being fair play! Hats off to the FBI here. The ads are targeted at people in Washington, DC, and some can be seen through a Facebook ad tracking tool.
