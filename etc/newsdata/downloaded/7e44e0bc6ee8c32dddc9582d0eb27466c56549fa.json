That is why this \u201cpay gap\u201d is best described as a choice gap, considering many women prefer flexible work schedules rather than longer hours and higher pay.\n\nAll workers should have the freedom to negotiate pay based on their personal needs without government intervention. Instead of trying to micromanage employers\u2019 practices to artificially eliminate the \u201cwage gap,\u201d policymakers should focus on reducing barriers to opportunity and supporting women in the choices they make for themselves.", "description": "Washington, D.C.\u2014The Heritage Foundation's\u00a0Rachel Greszler, research fellow in economics, budget and entitlements, offered the following statement in response to the House passing\u00a0H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act:\u00a0\n\n\nAll Americans deserve to be paid fairly according to the work they perform, but the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act hurts women by discouraging businesses from hiring them and disrespecting the choices they make for their lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
