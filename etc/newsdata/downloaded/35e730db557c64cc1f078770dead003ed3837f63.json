According to Olga Naidenko, Ph.D., a senior science adviser at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), chlorine, a by-product of water disinfection, is commonly found in municipal water supplies, as are hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including the carcinogenic trichloroethylene. These chemicals don\u2019t have to be ingested to cause health problems, she says, as studies have shown that lifeguards and frequent swimmers at indoor pools with high levels of chlorine have experienced problems such as exacerbated asthma symptoms\n\nThere are also aesthetic reasons for filtering your shower water. \u201cMany people notice that their hair is drier when they shampoo with hard water, that it frizzes more easily, and that not as much lather is created,\u201d says Anabel Kingsley, a trichologist (hair and scalp specialist), at the Philip Kingsley Clinic. Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium that can dry out the hair and skin. Water softeners and filters can remove these elements to relieve issues like dry skin or dandruff. Luke George, founder of the site Mr. Water Geek, says shower-filter users find that they have \u201csofter hair and skin, hair color that lasts longer and is better able to maintain its gloss and shine.\u201d\n\nWhen selecting a filter, Naidenko recommends first searching your zip code in the EWG\u2019s tap-water database to see what substances have been found in your area\u2019s water supply, then looking for filters that are certified to remove or reduce those specific contaminants. According to our experts, there are generally two design styles of filters: all-in-one models with a filter built in to a showerhead, and \u201cinline filters\u201d that are made to be installed between your shower arm \u2014 the pipe that delivers the water \u2014 and the showerhead. Inline models generally have universal adapters, so you should be able to easily attach everything. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up the filters recommended by our nine experts, and we\u2019ve also noted which have been certified by third-party testing for targeting common contaminants. Although most are inline filters, there are some all-in-one options as well, depending on your preference.\n\nBest inline shower water filters\n\nSprite High Output Shower Filter with Additional Shower Head In oxidation reduction (or redox) filters like this, a copper-zinc alloy, exchange electrons with contaminants, including metals like lead and mercury, to chemically convert them to harmless substances. The most commonly used type of redox material is the proprietary kinetic degradation fluxion (or KDF) formulation. According to Alexander Venet, the founder of custom-water-filtration company Molecule Project, KDF is the way to go. While carbon filters \u201cabsorb\u201d chlorine and other contaminants, KDF works differently. As Venet explains: \u201cIt has granular copper and zinc, which work to make an ionic exchange to the chlorine and changes it into a chloride, which is not harmful.\u201d He adds that it also helps eliminate bacteria, because \u201conce bacteria touches the copper and zinc, it gets killed off.\u201d Venet says Sprite filters are some of the best around. \u201cThey do it right. They use KDF-55. Copper is expensive, so if you use KDF-55, you\u2019re not cutting corners.\u201d This filter is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation, which, according to Stefan Buck, business unit manager for filtration at NSF International, means the filter has met the public health and safety organization\u2019s requirements \u201cfor chlorine reduction, material safety, and structural integrity.\u201d While this \u201chigh output\u201d filter also comes with a showerhead, we\u2019re including it with the inline models because you can easily swap in your existing head if you prefer. If you\u2019re not into the white look, Sprite also makes a chrome version (without the extra head). $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nCulligan ISH-100 Inline Shower Filter Many shower filters use carbon to absorb hazardous materials. \u201cActivated carbon is able to bind to all kinds of chemicals, collect VOCs, decrease the levels of chlorine, and reduce \u2014 but not remove \u2014 various types of metals,\u201d says Naidenko, who along with George recommends Culligan filters. According to George, Culligan filters are \u201ceasy to install, fit most standard showerheads, and aren\u2019t as bulky as some of the others.\u201d This NSF-certified inline model works with your existing showerhead and combines activated-carbon and oxidation-reduction technology to filter out contaminants and reduce bacteria. $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nKohler Aquifer Shower Water Filter According to Brian Maffia, director of showrooms at General Plumbing Supply, Inc., Kohler\u2019s new \u201cAquifer\u201d shower filter is a great option from a company with a strong reputation in bathroom and shower fittings. He notes, however, that this one will only work with handheld showers. \u201cIt improves the odor of the water, and removes chlorine, which can strip out a lot of the natural oils from your hair,\u201d Maffia notes, echoing what other experts told us about the drying effects of chlorine. \u201cWhen you come out of a chlorinated pool, your skin feels very dry,\u201d he explains, adding that filtering the chlorine out of your shower water can leave skin feeling \u201csmoother and less dry. People 100 percent see a difference. The water feels softer.\u201d Like the Culligan above, this Kohler model uses carbon and KDF filtration. $53 at Amazon Buy $53 at Amazon Buy\n\nInvigorated Water pH Energize 8-Stage Shower Filter One of George\u2019s favorite filters, the pH Energize eliminates the need to decide between filtering methods, as it includes eight levels of filtration for water to pass through. \u201cThis means that you don\u2019t have to worry about what each filter technique does,\u201d says George, \u201cand simply focus on what the shower filter is able to remove.\u201d The eight stages include tourmaline for absorbing potentially carcinogenic substances, KDF for removing heavy metal, and a steel micro-net for removing any silt or rust that may have transferred into the water from old pipes. $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nAquaBliss High Output 12-Stage Shower Filter If you want even more stages of filtration, this AquaBliss filter comes highly recommended by Danny Lipford, the host of the nationally syndicated home-improvement TV and radio show Today\u2019s Homeowner, who says it\u2019s \u201ca great choice for homeowners.\u201d As Lipford explains: \u201cA multistage shower filter will eliminate a variety of substances, but most important are chlorine and other minerals which can affect skin, scalp, and hair health.\u201d He likes that this model is \u201ceasy to install and offers quality filtering at a reasonable price,\u201d adding that \u201cas a bonus, it has a special feature to infuse vitamin C and other skin-friendly minerals into the shower\u2019s water supply.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest all-in-one shower water filters\n\nJonathan Product Beauty Hard Water Shower Filter System If your main concern is softening water to make it gentler on your hair and skin, George says this all-in-one filter \u201cdoes the best job at purifying shower water. It has two powerful stages of filtration [and] enhances the water pH balance.\u201d Redox and activated carbon remove chlorine and heavy metals while neutralizing potential contaminants. $66 at Amazon Buy $66 at Amazon Buy\n\nT3 Source Showerhead Mineral Water Filter Hairstylist Kristi Wilczopolski is also an advocate of using shower water filters to improve overall hair health. \u201cHard water has a ton of calcium and minerals in it that gets built up on the hair over time. A shower filter gets rid of all the extra toxins, chlorine and minerals, and impurities,\u201d she says. Wilczopolski personally uses this T3 filter, which simplifies matters since the filter is built into the showerhead itself. \u201cYou\u2019re not putting all the extra gunk into your hair, you\u2019re just getting clean, nice water,\u201d she says. It uses a redox filtration system that employs copper, zinc, and calcium sulfide. $130 at Amazon Buy $150 at Sephora Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
