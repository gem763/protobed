Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.", "description": "Rugby World Cup organisers warned Namibia and Canada about the \"potential of cancellation\" of their final pool game due to a typhoon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7916/934d2ec8b7834753ae5e7cc918e687d1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
