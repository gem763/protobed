Homegrown soprano Dame Nellie Melba even holds top billing on our $100 note.\n\nNow, lovers of the form can tread the boards themselves, as Opera Australia\u2019s walk-on offer is providing a novel way to get among the action.\n\nThe package costs $5000 and just 10 spots are available each year, and only during specific productions \u2013 this year, it was La Boheme. The walk-on participant is taken through a fitting, costuming and make-up, getting something of the everyday experience of a performer. Don\u2019t bother warming up your pipes, though; walk-ons don\u2019t get to sing.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps a sign of how beloved Opera Australia is that its programming is always controversial, yet invariably successful. Last year, artistic director Lyndon Terracini announced that OA was \u201cthe only opera company in the world where more than 50 per cent of our budget comes from box office, because we\u2019ve embraced the 21st century\u201d.\n\nPart of this, he says, is introducing experiences such as the walk-on roles. \u201cWalk-on roles are fantastic for people who usually sit in the audience,\u201d he says, adding that they offer a new perspective on the production. And despite the attendant panic that may come from having newcomers on the stage each night, Terracini is adamant that the experience is \u201cvirtually risk-free\u201d.\n\nTerracini is known for programming plenty of crowd-pleasing fare, including evergreens with well-known arias and big choral pieces, such as La Boheme, Turandot and Carmen. This year\u2019s Sydney Harbour spectacle was West Side Story; the Romeo and Juliet romance set to a poppy Bernstein score.\n\nBut under Terracini, Opera Australia has also been feted for work that defies expectations. The 2019 season included a new digital opera about Brett Whiteley and a difficult production of the atonal Wozzeck. And for those who can\u2019t get enough Valkyries, in 2020 the company will present Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle in its entirety, clocking in at 15 hours spread over four nights.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
