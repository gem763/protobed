Singapore said the deal had driven up prices, while the Philippines criticised the firms for completing the merger too soon and for a dip in service quality.\n\nHowever, Iskandar said the Malaysian regulator's investigations were based on complaints received against the ride-hailing firm, and not due to its near monopoly of the market after the Uber deal.\n\nUnder Malaysia's Competition Act, a monopoly or dominant player in the market is not an infringement of the law, unless it abuses its position in the market.\n\n\"MyCC does not have mergers powers. We cannot unscramble the egg,\" Mr Iskandar said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - [KUALA LUMPUR]\u00a0 Malaysia's competition regulator on Thursday proposed a fine of over RM86 million (S$28.4 million) on ride-hailing firm Grab for violating competition law by imposing restrictive clauses on its drivers. .
