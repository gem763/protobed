U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\ncrude was down 8 cents, or 0.14%, at $55.46 a barrel.\n\nThe United States and China were continuing to work on an\n\ninterim trade agreement, but it may not be completed in time for\n\nU.S. and Chinese leaders to sign it next month, a U.S.\n\nadministration official said. The latest potential setback in the negotiations stalled a\n\nrally in global share markets. MKTS/GLOB\n\n\"Selling came courtesy of the fading optimism over trade and\n\na Fed rate cut. Risk assets were dealt a blow as market players\n\nworried that the US and China would delay settling their trade\n\ndifferences,\" said PVM analyst Stephen Brennock.\n\nHowever, U.S. crude inventories fell 708,000 barrels in the\n\nweek ended Oct. 25 to 436 million, compared with analysts'\n\nexpectations for an increase of 494,000 barrels, according to\n\ndata from the industry group, the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nAPI/S\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the outcome of the Federal\n\nReserve's two-day policy meeting this week. The Fed looks set\n\nlater on Wednesday to nudge along a U.S. economy that is being\n\nhampered by slowing investment and weak growth overseas. It\n\nwould be the third cut this year. A rate cut would help support oil prices as a stronger\n\neconomy typically implies higher demand for crude, while falling\n\ninventories suggest the market is coming into balance.\n\nRussia's deputy energy minister also said on Tuesday it was\n\ntoo early to talk of deeper output cuts by OPEC and its allies,\n\nadding to the pressure on the market. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and\n\nother producers including Russia - a grouping referred to as\n\nOPEC+ - have cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day to\n\nsupport prices since January.\n\nIn the United States, gasoline stocks dropped by 4.7 million\n\nbarrels, compared with analyst expectations for a drop of 2.2\n\nmillion barrels, and distillate stocks were down by 1.6 million\n\nbarrels, versus an expected fall of 2.35 million barrels.\n\nStill, crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub\n\nfor WTI rose by 1.2 million barrels, the API said.\n\nThe Energy Information Agency (EIA) is set to issue its\n\nweekly report at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.
