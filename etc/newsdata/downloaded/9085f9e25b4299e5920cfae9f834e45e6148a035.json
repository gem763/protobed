He and Wayne always got on well and he likes him. But he has made his feelings clear. Cutting him off on social media is a totally deliberate snub.'\n\nRebekah cut her family holiday short after Coleen's dramatic accusation on Wednesday, which has enthralled Britain in the so-called 'war of the WAGs.'\n\nEmotional return home: Rebekah Vardy was pictured returning to London's Heathrow Airport in floods of tears with her husband Jamie by her side on Saturday, amid her feud with Coleen\n\nTheir sighting comes amid claims Rebekah has threatened Coleen with legal action over allegations of leaking staged Instagram stories, warning her: 'Believe me or I'll see you in court.'\n\nThe feuding pair are said to be communicating through their lawyers in the wake of the bitter row which has dominated social media and newspapers this week.\n\nA source close to heavily pregnant Vardy now claims she is fully prepared to face her fellow WAG in court if she refuses to believe her innocence.\n\nThe source told The Sun: 'She is prepared to see Coleen in court if necessary.'\n\nEarlier in the day Coleen was spotted outside her Cheshire home in the midst of her controversial war with Rebekah.\n\nThe wife of Wayne Rooney maintained a steely expression as she headed out in her lavish motor just two days after alleging that the pregnant spouse of Leicester player Jamie was leaking fake stories about her to The Sun.\n\nTeary display: In the emotional pictures, Rebekah is seen struggling to hide her tears as she makes her way through the busy airport hand-in-hand with husband Jamie\n\nAs she stepped out, fellow WAG Nicola McLean, 38, appeared on This Morning, where she lashed out at Coleen for the danger she is placing on Rebekah, who is seven months pregnant and is said to be 'distressed'.\n\nGiving her opinion on the row, Nicola hit out at Coleen for publicly accusing pregnant Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press.\n\nIn what has become a War of the WAGs, Coleen released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah in which she revealed she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' who was leaking fake stories.\n\nSubsequently Nicola issued a warning to Coleen about stressing out an expectant mother, as she said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay... Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy recently gave an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon'.\n\nRecalling the dreaded phone call between them, Rebekah revealed: 'I said to her: \"Coleen, what on earth have you done?\"'\n\n'It was not an easy phone call. She said to me: \"I'm not pointing the finger\" and I said: \"You have just annihilated me in public and hung me out to dry. The whole world hates me!\"\n\n'I thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me. She said: \"You know, I always really liked you, which makes it harder.\"'\n\nAsked whether the pair argued, Rebekah was careful not to explicitly denounce Coleen, but said: 'That would be like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it's still going to s*** in your hair.'\n\nIt has been revealed that Rebekah has hired a team of forensic IT experts to prove her innocence after Coleen accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained from her private Instagram.\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline on Wednesday night that 'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nClash: The feuding pair are said to be communicating through their lawyers in the wake of the bitter row which has dominated social media and newspapers this week (pictured in 2016)\n\nMeanwhile, friends of Coleen say she will not be goaded into coming forward with any further evidence as she is happy with her own investigations.\n\nRebekah had previously demanded to see screenshots of the Instagram stories and who had viewed them.\n\nThey added: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn't stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn't understand why Coleen didn't reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\n'She's flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nThe scandal has gripped the nation to such an extent that police officers went to the Vardys' home because of the horrific trolling they faced.\n\nThe couple were still on holiday in Dubai earlier this week but police arrived at their home in Lincolnshire to check on their security in the wake of the vile messages Rebekah had received.\n\nLincolnshire Police officers spent about 20 minutes at the property speaking to security guards.\n\nLast week, Coleen launched an incredible social media attack on Rebekah, revealing how she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' her leaking fake stories.\n\nHer dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Vardy this afternoon who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nFans have also praised Rooney \u2013 calling her \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 - for the sensational way in which she revealed Vardy was the alleged culprit by concluding her post with a thriller-worthy 'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe saga began when Coleen took to social media to reveal she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nVardy is a queen of self-promotion who has risen to the top rank of footballers wives from humble beginnings - the daughter of a BBC local radio DJ and a window cleaner father who has two ex husbands.\n\nBefore meeting current husband Jamie, she was working in a Sheffield nightclub and dating a Vauxhall conference football player who has previously accused her of ditching him to 'trade up' to Premier League star.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation\n\nColeen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nAt odds: Before the accusations, Coleen and Rebekah were friends, with their respective spouses playing for England around the same time (pictured supporting them at Euro 2016)\n\nClose friends only: This is believed to be Coleen's private account - which is separate to the one she shares with the public\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'\n\nAllegation: Coleen (pictured on Wednesday morning) claims Rebekah sold stories about her personal life to The Sun\n\nRebekah's spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky\u2019s social media posts.\n\n'It isn\u2019t true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with. Such a shame that Coleen didn\u2019t just call her when she had her number.'\n\nMeanwhile, it's been reported that a Manchester poker player called Dave first gave Coleen the idea for her Vardy sting when he tweeted the idea to her back in January.\n\nHis idea came after Coleen first expressed a concern that someone close to her was leaking stories from her private social media account after it was reported she was involved in a car crash while on holiday.\n\nShe had written: 'Thank you for the messages asking if I am ok\u2026 the car crash story was completely wrong. I wasn't involved in a crash... the car was damaged by another car.\n\nDid 'Dave' inspire Coleen's investigation? Coleen Rooney may have got the idea for her Vardy sting from a Manchester poker player who tweeted the idea to her back in January. His idea came after Coleen first expressed a concern that someone close to her was leaking stories. He tweeted: 'Make a false story tell people different things see which one comes out = find the culprit' He told Daily Star on Wednesday: ' 'Firstly I hope Coleen is okay. To have a friend betray her like that is something you don't expect.'\n\n'Someone on my private Instagram [has] seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper. It\u2019s happened several times now over the past couple of years.\n\nShe continued: 'It\u2019s sad to think someone, who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.'\n\nDave then responded: 'Make a false story tell people different things see which one comes out = find the culprit' - and although Coleen didn't reply to him, she did just that.\n\nHe told Daily Star on Wednesday: 'Firstly I hope Coleen is okay. To have a friend betray her like that is something you don't expect.'\n\nHe has now changed his Twitter bio to read: 'Detective who recently solved the Coleen Rooney vs Rebekah Vardy case.'\n\nIt was claimed back in 2016 that Wayne had 'warned' Jamie Vardy about Rebekah in England showdown talks in 2016.\n\nWayne and Jamie were both part of the England squad at Euro 2016 as the Three Lions were dumped out by Iceland.\n\nThe Times claimed Rooney told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts. She had earlier hit out at French police for treating England fans 'like animals'.\n\nEx England boss Roy Hodgson was forced to deny reports that Rooney and Vardy had fallen out during the Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nNew footage: As the drama continued over the weekend, Wayne was spotted being served drinks by a waitress wearing a pair of high-waisted thongs as he partied in Washington, DC, on Saturday night\n\nHodgson said: 'I haven't got a clue what you are referring to. There are absolutely no problems in football terms between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy.\n\n'In fact quite the reverse, they are very close friends, both on the field and off the field. I have got no idea what you are referring to.\n\n'I certainly would advise Wayne to give no comment to it because it is obviously one salacious story that someone has managed to spin. It is of no interest to us.'\n\nAs the drama continued over the weekend, Wayne was spotted being served drinks by a waitress wearing a pair of high-waisted thongs as he partied in Washington, DC, on Saturday night.\n\nIn a video shared on Instagram, the 33-year-old footballer is seen nodding at the blonde woman after being served as he watched patrons dance to Joe Budden's rap hit Pump It Up at US capitol hotspot Living Room DC.\n\nWayne, who plays for MLS team DC United and will return to the UK next year to join Derby County, posed for snapshots with fans.\n\nHis wife returned to wearing her wedding ring four weeks ago, after Wayne reportedly stripped to his boxer shorts in front of three women at a Jacuzzi party in Vancouver, Canada, in August.", "description": "Coleen Rooney stepped out in Alderley Edge on Monday morning, two days after fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy returned from her Dubai holiday early following their explosive public spat.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas And Ryan Smith For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19683226-0-image-a-137_1571043409588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
