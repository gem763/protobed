(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nCtrl + N\n\nMemes are transforming conservative politics \u2014 and posing new challenges to social media companies grappling with their policies for political content.\n\nThe latest example of boundary pushing is a violent parody depicting President Trump shooting journalists and attacking political opponents (both Democrats and Republicans). The video \u2014 which had been available on YouTube for more than a year \u2014 saw a spike in traffic yesterday after it aired over the weekend during a conference hosted by the pro-Trump group American Priority at the president's Miami-area golf resort.\n\nCritics warned the video could incite real-world violence, but YouTube said the video does not violate its policies because it is \"clearly fictional.\" The company yesterday added an age restriction to the video requiring viewers to confirm they are adults before they can watch it.\n\n\u201cFor content containing violence that is clearly fictional, we age-restrict and display a warning interstitial. We applied these protections to this video,\u201d Ivy Choi, a spokeswoman for YouTube, told my colleagues Drew Harwell and Tony Romm.\n\nThe violent video also remains available on Facebook. \u201cBecause this video was disturbing, we put it behind a warning screen and people under 18 will be blocked from seeing it,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said.\n\nThe responses by social media companies highlight the constant balancing act of the tech companies. Silicon Valley giants are promising to do more to ensure their platforms do not incite real-world violence or amplify disinformation amid pressure from politicians around the globe. But they\u2019re also trying not to go too far in policing content, especially as officials \u2014 including Trump \u2014 accuse the companies of political bias against conservatives.\n\nThe companies\u2019 dilemma is only intensifying as Election Day 2020 gets closer, and the Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings against the president result in an even more politically inflammatory environment.\n\nThe controversy also brought greater scrutiny to the Twitter account Carpe Donktum, who runs the pro-Trump meme site MemeWorld. The YouTube account that posted the parody video showing Trump engaged in a massacre inside a church, TheGeekzTeam, is a regular contributor to the site. Carpe Donktum posted memes making fun of the criticism that the spoof video could incite real-world violence.\n\nIn a statement to my colleagues, Carpe Donktum, who attended a social media conference at White House, said the video was \u201cCLEARLY satirical\u201d and that \u201cno reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media.\"\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Carpe Donktum\u2019s Twitter account was briefly banned for, he said, breaking the social media site\u2019s copyright rules with another video. But he was swiftly back on the platform. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment from my colleagues.\n\nThe video is also sparking more intense backlash against the president's ties to far-right meme makers. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told my colleagues the video was \u201cabhorrent,\u201d and criticized Trump for having \u201cpromoted extremist voices\u201d for political gain. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), meanwhile, told Drew and Tony the incident was \u201cdisturbing, but frankly not surprising.\"\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, Mr. Trump has cultivated support from some of the worst corners of the internet. He\u2019s used his office to elevate this toxic internet culture while ignoring the real challenges we face on social media,\u201d Warner said in a statement.\n\nThe president's ties to such meme makers were highlighted earlier this year, when he hosted many far-right provocateurs at the White House for a \"Social Media Summit.\" Stephanie Grisham, the president\u2019s press secretary, said yesterday that Trump \u201chas not yet seen the video,\u201d and would watch later, \u201cbut based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.\"\n\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

(iStock)\n\nBITS: Colleges are turning to increasingly sophisticated web-browsing tracking software and consulting companies that can buy and analyze students' online data history in evaluating student applications, my colleagues Douglas MacMillan and Nick Anderson report. The practice not only allows schools to seek out and give preferential treatment to high-income students, but could also be violating federal law, according to some experts.\n\nAt least 44 public and private universities in the United States work with outside consulting companies to collect and analyze data on prospective students. Of the 33 schools using web-tracking software from the consulting firm Capture Higher Ed, only three fully disclosed the purpose of the tracking software, The Post found. Many did not give students the options to opt out of cookie collection or had policies on their websites that seemed to conflict with actual practices.\n\nExperts say the data collection practices could violate federal law protecting the privacy of student education records at schools that receive federal education funds. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, schools must generally ask for students\u2019 permission before sharing their personal data with outside parties.\n\nZachary Greenberg, a program officer at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a student advocacy group, said colleges who work in secret with data consultants undermine this right. \u201cStudents deserve to know where their information is going,\u201d Greenberg told my colleagues.\n\nAngela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, declined to say whether colleges may be violating the law by sharing data with consulting companies.\n\nThe practices could also lead to discrimination against lower-income students who may not have as large of a digital footprint, says Bradley Shear, a Maryland lawyer who has pushed for better regulation of students\u2019 online privacy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the algorithm should run the admissions department,\u201d Shear said.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Photo by Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNIBBLES: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been meeting with conservative journalists and commentators at his home in an effort to address concerns from the right over alleged bias against conservatives on the platform, Natasha Bertrand and Daniel Lippman at Politico report. The closed-door meetings are likely to fuel more suspicion from Democrats, who have accused the platform of altering its policies to favor conservative voices\n\n\u201cThe discussion in Silicon Valley is that Zuckerberg is very concerned about the Justice Department, under Bill Barr, bringing an enforcement action to break up the company,\u201d a former government official based in Silicon Valley told Politico. The dinners, which have included Ben Shapiro, Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are geared toward discussing issues including free speech and potential partnerships. An independent audit into potential bias against conservatives at Facebook released this summer revealed various concerns, but did not point to any concrete evidence of the problem.\n\nBut the White House is looking for more than just \u201cnominal outreach,\u201d a senior Trump administration official told Politico. The official said the White House is looking for Facebook to take \u201cmeaningful steps\u201d on \u201ccompetition, free speech for everybody including conservatives, and privacy.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg's alleged attempts to gain favorability with Trump may cast increased scrutiny on the company from Democratic lawmakers. Presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden have recently ramped up attacks on the company over its decision not to send misleading political ads to fact-checkers. Democratic members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees technology communications issues, have also written to Facebook with concerns it doesn\u2019t take disinformation seriously enough.\n\nZuckerberg defended the meetings in a Facebook post, adding that he has \"dinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time.\"\n\nThere's some press today discussing dinners I've had with conservative politicians, media and thinkers. To be clear, I...

(Maddie Schroeder/The Columbus Dispatch via AP)\n\nBYTES: The Democratic National Committee is warning presidential campaigns to be on the lookout for a surge in disinformation operations in advance of tonight\u2019s debate, Ryan Lizza writes for Politico.\n\nThe alert is part of a series of security missives from the DNC and warns of \u201cheightened disinformation and discourse manipulation activity leading up to, during, and after the debates with the goal of polarizing opposing Democratic supporters.\u201d\n\nRyan describes a massive Democratic operation to track and combat disinformation \u2013 both from foreign adversaries and Republican and Democratic adversaries. It includes a DNC software tool called Trendolizer that tracks trending disinformation, a disinformation war room inside Twitter headquarters and a fast track communication operation with the third-party fact checkers Facebook relies on to correct false narratives.\n\nBut correcting disinformation can be tricky. \u201cWhen contemplating a response to disinformation narratives, campaigns should consider whether misinformation has reached a tipping point where the costs of ignoring the issue are higher than the costs of the amplification that a response might generate,\u201d the DNC privately instructed presidential campaigns.\n\nPRIVATE CLOUD\n\nUber logo. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\n-- Uber told a Georgia court it employs \u201czero\u201d drivers and was not \u201cin the business of providing transportation\u201d in 2017, according to documents from a civil suit against the company alleging it was responsible for the actions of a driver who struck the plaintiff, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports. The newly reported documents highlight a long-standing strategy by Uber lawyers to avoid liability for the actions of its millions of contractors. A new California law that could compel the company to reclassify its contractors as employees could put the company\u2019s essential legal strategy at risk, Greg reports.\n\n\u201cLiability is one of the big unspoken-about issues here,\u201d Lorena Gonzalez (D), a California state assemblywoman who crafted the new law, told Greg. \u201cWe want to ensure there\u2019s responsibility at the end of the day and that they are not just passing that along to someone else.\u201d\n\nUber faces lawsuits each year, including ones seeking to make the company liable for driver behavior. Courts have often sided with Uber, however. But if the new law forces Uber to reclassify its employees, courts may be more likely to find Uber responsible for driver activity. That could mean potentially millions in new liabilities for the company, Greg writes.\n\n\u2014 News from the private sector:\n\nTikTok has moved into Facebook's backyard and is starting to poach its employees TikTok, the upstart social media app, has opened an office in Silicon Valley and begun to poach Facebook employees, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNBC.
