EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that Ankara should not \u201cexpect the EU to pay for any of\u201d the said zone.\n\n\u201cThe EU calls upon Turkey to cease the unilateral military action,\u201d the 28 members of the bloc said in a joint statement. \u201cIt is unlikely that a so-called 'safe zone' in north-east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com IMAGES from northeastern Syria show civilians fleeing Turkish \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin urged his Turkish counterpart to \u201cgauge the situation comprehensively\u201d so that Ankara\u2019s actions would not undermine the peace process in Syria.\n\nAn extraordinary UN Security Council meeting to assess the situation in Syria has been called by France and the UK and is expected to be held behind closed doors on Thursday, according to media reports.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the Turkish actions were \u201cjeopardizing the anti-Islamic State coalition's security and humanitarian efforts,\u201d while his Dutch counterpart Stef Blok condemned the invasion and summoned Ankara\u2019s envoy over it.\n\nEgypt has urged the UNSC to halt \u201cany attempts to occupy Syrian territories\u201d and condemned the Turkish aggression in the \u201cstrongest terms,\u201d calling for an emergency meeting of the League of Arab States as well. Similar reactions came from Saudi Arabia, Bahrein, Iran and others.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkish invasion of Syria \u2018bad idea,\u2019 Ankara now responsible for all ISIS prisoners \u2013 Trump\n\nThe invasion began two days after US President Donald Trump decided to pull US troops out from northeastern Syria, in a move his critics \u2013 but also some allies \u2013 have condemned as an open betrayal of the Kurdish-led militias, namely the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe SDF have served as ground troops for the US-led campaign against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists since 2015. However, Turkey \u2013 a long-time NATO ally \u2013 has complained about Washington providing weapons and training to the groups that it perceives as a threat to its security and has designated as terrorists.\n\nTrump insisted that he did not endorse the Turkish invasion in any way, calling it a \u201cbad idea,\u201d and yet again promised to \u201cwipe out\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Ankara fails to protect civilians and religious minorities, or fails to ensure no humanitarian crisis takes place.\n\nLike this story?
