Keeping it open and free-flowing has become a key sticking point.\n\nDiplomats in Brussels told AFP that Johnson's real deadline to draw up a jointly-agreed legal Brexit text is now just a week.\n\nThe October 17-18 summit's agenda will be set next Friday. European official insists this is not an ultimatum but a simple fact of how the Brussels diplomatic calendar works.\n\nThey also note that actual negotiations on Johnson's new plan have not even begun.\n\n\"There has not been enough progress to begin a negotiation,\" a European Commission official said.\n\nThe frustrating confusion over Brexit has seen some leaders who had been more sympathetic to Britain's plight to question the need to delay the whole process further still.\n\n\"We will only consider a new deadline if a solution is in sight,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Friday.\n\n\"We are against a delay just for the sake of delay.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday faced fresh court action to stop him taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal as chances of an agreement faded with a warning from Brussels that he had just a week to flesh out his new Brexit plans.
