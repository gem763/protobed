It also receives requests for stamps from people around the world.\n\nMr Adams, 26, from Newcastle in Co Down, said: \u201cPolar places are something which I am passionate about.\n\n\u201cIt is such a unique environment to live and spend such a prolonged period of time in.\n\n\u201cVery few people get to go and even less get to spend such a significant period of time being part of the environment and being able to impart snippets of knowledge.\u201d\n\nKit Adams is swapping life in Co Down for a role as a postman in Antarctica (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\nThe island was originally set up in a secret British military operation and later converted into a museum and post office.\n\nIt is home to around 2,000 gentoo penguins and hosts tourists off cruise ships during the southern hemisphere\u2019s summer months.\n\nThe posting will involve working at the shop and museum, monitoring the penguins and lecturing on the cruise ships.\n\nWhen he arrives later this year he expects to find a lot of sea ice and the area covered in snow.\n\n\u201cWe may have to dig out the buildings, though the sea ice will decrease and the snow will melt.\u201d\n\nThe temperature will be well below zero on occasion once wind chill is factored in.\n\nGlare from the snow will be a major issue and will require protective sun glasses.\n\nBy the end of the summer season most of the snow will have melted.\n\nIn preparation for the posting Mr Adams received a lecture from a \u201cpenguinologist\u201d, a type of ornithologist.\n\nHe has learned about the birds\u2019 life cycles, and how to conduct surveys on the animals.\n\nPart of the role will be ensuring the birds are not interfered with by visitors.\n\nThe geographer has always been interested in mountaineering, growing up at the foot of the Mourne range in Co Down.\n\nHe recalled of the peaks: \u201cWhen there was snow on them they became even more appealing.\u201d\n\nPart of his geography degree involved conducting research on avalanching in Scottish mountains.\n\nHe has previously been to the Arctic; to the northern Norway mainland, Svalbard island and Greenland.", "description": "Kit Adams, 26, from Newcastle in Co Down, said polar places were something he was passionate about.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/13/wire-19653724-1570968527-226_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
