(On Friday, bitcoin\u2019s price shot up 13 percent to more than $8,400.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult real-time to understand what\u2019s causing a price decline or a price appreciation. After the fact, you can piece together pieces of news that may have caused it,\u201d said Dorman, adding:\n\nRelated: WATCH: What Drove Bitcoin\u2019s Price Gains Today? We Explore the Pop \u201cI think over the last months, not just yesterday, you\u2019re definitely seeing some miners selling, which is causing some downward pressure. But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There\u2019s just not new money coming in at the moment.\u201d\n\nHis take? There is no \u201cbuyer of last resort\u201d in crypto, which means that \u201cdistressed\u201d assets don\u2019t get scooped up.\n\nDorman also commented on the Libra hearings, saying he\u2019s not certain they had much effect.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, I think retail investors probably aren\u2019t spending a lot of time watching C-SPAN,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: NYSE Parent Company Launches Cryptocurrency Data Feed\n\nYou can watch the rest of the interview above or read the transcript below.\n\nBrad Keoun: We\u2019re here today with Jeff Dorman. He\u2019s the chief investment officer of Arca. We\u2019re very lucky to have him. He has a long resume of experience. He\u2019s a former high-yield bond trader with big firms like Citadel, Merrill Lynch and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, and lately he\u2019s been bringing that experience to bear in the crypto space. Jeff, thank you so much for your time today.\n\nJeff Dorman: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.\n\nBK: Yesterday we had a very big move down in bitcoin, and I\u2019d love to get your thoughts there on what happened.\n\nJD: Sure, it is always difficult to understand what\u2019s causing a price decline or price appreciation. After the fact, you can piece together pieces of news that may have caused it. I think over the last months, not just yesterday, you\u2019re definitely seeing some miners selling, which is causing some downward pressure. But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There\u2019s just not new money coming in at the moment, and, more importantly, there\u2019s no buyer of last resort. In traditional asset classes, you see rotation when equities go to cheap. The distressed bond guys start to buy if distressed bonds or companies by that their own bonds and equities. In crypto, right now, there really is just no buyer of last resort. You\u2019re not seeing that rotation yet, so until that until that starts to happen, I think moves up and down are always going to be exacerbated.\n\nBK: What\u2019s it gonna take for that to happen?\n\nJD: It\u2019s a good question. I think a lot of it is still the education. I think people are definitely learning. Education is number one. We need to get reputable companies in here who help traditional investors get in here and part of it is simply getting traditional investors to recognize that this really is an asset class that they can you can use for a variety of different purposes, whether that\u2019s for hedging with speculation, whether it\u2019s for growth.\n\nBK: Just sort of anecdotally looking at bitcoin market, and it seems like we\u2019ll have these big stair-step moves and then we\u2019ll go along in a range, and then we\u2019ll have another very large move. I\u2019m curious for people who are kind of kicking the tires on this market. What out of the how did they look at that?\n\nJD: I think for the most part, traditional investors are not scared off by volatility as long as there\u2019s upside volatility as well right now, but volatility can be managed. There are certainly times when you\u2019ll get all sides. There are certainly times where you don\u2019t see something coming and you\u2019re not hedged or wedged appropriately. For the most part, traditional investors are very good at managing risk, and they\u2019re very good at managing volatility so that that\u2019s to me, not something that\u2019s going to scare people away from this market. I think what will scare them away is not understanding where the volatility is coming from, and I think that\u2019s where a lot of the due diligence is going through right now, trying to figure out how it\u2019s happening, how they can prevent against it what kind of managers or that they can trust to actually manage that risk for them.\n\nStory continues", "description": "CoinDesk's Brad Keoun talks to Arca's investment head about recent bitcoin price activity.", "authors": ["John Biggs", "Brad Keoun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QS_qoR2HlniNA6_.W21H3Q--~B/aD03MzQ7dz0xNDY4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/1a548aecc17332d0f4483a652c9b95d8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
