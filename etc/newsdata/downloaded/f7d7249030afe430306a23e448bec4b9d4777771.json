Read this before buying your next pair of heavy earrings originally appeared on goodmorningamerica.com\n\nElaborate, gorgeous earrings continue to grow in popularity, but the heavier they are, the more dangerous they can be to your skin.\n\nThis year, hoops had a full-circle moment, and while some styles are light and dainty others can be quite weighty leading to pain.\n\nConstantly wearing heavy earrings can wreak havoc, and eventually lead to complete splitting of the earlobe.\n\nPHOTO: A guest wears earrings, a grey shirt, outside Thom Browne, during Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2019/2020, March 3, 2019 in Paris.

Ab-so-lute-ly!)\n\nPreventative measures\n\nAn easy option would be to avoid heavy earrings, but that's no fun, right? A better solution is to try making statement earrings an occasional add on to your look versus an everyday thing.\n\nBaron also advises that a lot of earlobe splitting comes from the earring being snagged or pulled on something.\n\nPHOTO: A split ear lobe is seen here.

Then, the deeper layers of tissue are stitched back together. The skin is then closed on top with more stitches.\n\nDuring this process, the old earring hole is closed up and left to heal.\n\nAfter care\n\nBaron advises that any new piercings or wearing earrings has to be avoided for three to six months post-reconstructive surgery of your earlobe split. This allows the skin and scar tissue to heal and mature.\n\nAfter stitches are removed, stick-on are safe to wear, and after four to six weeks, you can move on to clip-on earrings.\n\n\"I often see patients back after that period to re-pierce their ears for them,\" Baron said. \"I try to avoid piercing right within the scar, as that is always a little bit weaker than skin that hasn't been interrupted.\"\n\nShe adds, \"Moving forward, I recommend staying away from heavy or large earrings.\"", "description": "Constantly wearing heavy earrings can wreak havoc, and eventually lead to complete splitting of the earlobe.  \"If you notice that your earring hole is starting to elongate and become more of a slit rather than a hole, then it is being stretched,\" warns Atlanta-based plastic and reconstructive", "authors": ["Jacqueline Laurean Yates"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rfvp31GVseiPl.NXV6As2Q--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/earring-gty-er-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
