Already, we've spotted notable week on week sales increases for flea treatments in London, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\n\"Our study revealed that people in these regions prefer their homes slightly warmer than other parts of the UK, which could be a factor.\n\n\"Fleas are a nightmare for our pets. They\u2019re not only a discomfort, but can cause inflammation and severe pain as well as acting as a carrier for other parasites such as tapeworm. It is so much easier to prevent an infestation than treat one.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHow to spot a flea outbreak according to vet Zoe Costigan", "description": "Experts are warning pet owners to be cautious when turning up the central heating at home this winter", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19006157.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-589009396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
