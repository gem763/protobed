Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve already sought out the best men\u2019s slippers on Amazon, asked a homebody about her favorite house slippers, and singled out the best unisex wool slippers, so now we\u2019re feeling out the coziest women\u2019s slippers you can find on Amazon (note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity).\n\nBest sheepskin slippers\n\nUGG Women\u2019s Scuffette Slippers 4.3 stars, 780 reviews \u201cSearched for the ultimate in comfort and style in a house slipper \u2026 now I\u2019ve found it!!! I was hesitant to pay the price, but now I\u2019m sooo glad I did. This shoe will most likely last me for the rest of my life . It is totally comfortable, stays on my foot snugly, and doesn\u2019t slip and slide; the sole is just right for stepping outside for the mail, and is quiet and secure on hardwood floors. This slipper is my \u2018go-to\u2019 shoe after a hard day of standing on my feet.\u201d From $85 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest shearling slippers\n\nAcorn Women\u2019s Moc Slipper 4.2 stars, 1,787 reviews \u201cThese slippers are fantastic. I wear them to keep me warm in the house, and I wear them outside. I have even worn them to the supermarket. I have even worn them when it rains. I wash and dry them, and they\u2019re still wearable, after two years, without the uppers coming apart from the sides. For $40, you just can\u2019t beat how well they\u2019re made.\u201d From $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest fleece slippers\n\nLuxehome Women\u2019s Cozy Fleece Slippers 4.5 stars, 1,052 reviews \u201cThese are extremely comfortable. I needed some house shoes that provided support and cushion on hardwood floors, and these do a great job. They\u2019re incredibly soft and give the right amount of cushion. They have a hard sole, so they can be worn outside if needed and provide traction.\u201d From $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest faux-fur slippers\n\nSorel Women\u2019s Nakiska Slipper 4.6 stars, 1,501 reviews \u201cMy feet were cold at home, so I ordered these slippers to wear around the house in the winter. These slippers are warm and cozy and look great on. They are nicely stitched suede with a 50 percent wool, 50 percent polyester lining. They have a cushioned feel to them. You do not feel like you are barefoot as you might in less substantial slippers. I put them on the minute I step in the house and don\u2019t take them off again until bedtime.\u201d From $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest wool slippers\n\nHaflinger Women\u2019s AS20 Slipper 4.4 stars, 176 reviews \u201cAs comfortable as ever. These are all I wear for slippers in the winter. Have been for years. Great arch support yet not stiff and confining.\u201d From $79 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest memory-foam slippers\n\nWomen\u2019s Soft Slip-on Memory Foam Slippers 4.5 stars, 1,522 reviews \u201cI love these so much. I got two pairs \u2014 one for my mom and one for me, and she loved them. They fit perfectly and snugly. They are very comfy and have a nice plushy bottom. I like the hard sole as well.\u201d From $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest moccasin slippers\n\nMinnetonka Chrissy Slipper Bootie 4.2 stars, 532 reviews \u201cI am so happy with these slippers! I have the standard Minnetonka slipper, but I\u2019ve had them forever and wear them every day, so I figured it was time for a replacement. I\u2019m so happy I went with the bootie. Having your ankle and the top of your foot covered makes all the difference in the world for level of warmth, and the insides of these are SO soft.\u201d $42 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest indoor or outdoor slippers\n\nClppli Women\u2019s Slippers With a Faux Fur Trim 4.3 stars, 2,097 reviews \u201cI\u2019m a slipper hoarder, and I got these specifically so I can comfortably go outside with my dog \u2014 something with soles on the bottom. They are AMAZINGLY comfortable. They\u2019re well-made, and they have heavy rubber on the bottom, so you can wear them outside. The fur inside is warm and so soft. Winter is coming! Get these!!\u201d From $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest slipper socks\n\nWorld\u2019s Softest Cozy Slippers 4.3 stars, 1,925 reviews \u201cWe\u2019re a no-shoes house, so I\u2019ve had occasion to own many slippers. These truly are the most comfortable slippers I\u2019ve ever had \u2014 very warm, soft, and with plenty of room inside. They\u2019re also easy to put on and take off, and the elastic band at the opening keeps them from falling off unintentionally. Lastly, the slippers are ambidextrous, so there\u2019s no need to match a slipper to a particular foot.\u201d From $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest ballerina slippers\n\nIsotoner Women\u2019s Terry Ballerina Slipper 4.2 stars, 1,529 reviews \u201cI really love these slippers! Comfortable, washable, and lightweight, but have a substantial sole and fairly thick padding inside. The terry fabric gives, so if you have bunions or crazy-shaped feet, you\u2019ll still be comfortable. The fit around the top is snug, but it\u2019s not uncomfortable, and they stay on your feet.\u201d From $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest flip-flop slippers\n\nAcorn Women\u2019s Spa Thong Slipper 4.3 stars, 491 reviews \u201cI love these slippers! They\u2019re so soft. It may sound like an exaggeration, but I get a relaxed, happy feeling as I slide my feet through them. Yeah, I do. They have a nice, level, \u2018half-inch off the floor\u2019 support, which is great because I don\u2019t like to feel as if I\u2019m walking on the sand at the beach.\u201d From $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest open-toe slippers\n\nHome Ideas Women\u2019s Open-Toe Terry Cloth Slippers 4 stars, 300 reviews \u201cThese are very soft and have a cushioned bottom. They have the bottom that keeps you from slipping. I am someone who doesn\u2019t like to be hot at all, and they aren\u2019t warm enough to be an issue. They are pretty perfect and the price was just right. I highly recommend them to everyone.\u201d From $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest slipper boots\n\nAcorn Women\u2019s Slouch Boot Slipper 4.2 stars, 178 reviews \u201cThese are my favorite slipper boots that I\u2019ve tried. I have been wearing them daily since I received them. The elastic at the top of the sock part is good. Not too tight, yet snug enough to keep them exactly where I put them. The sole is substantial for walking yet soft for lounging. I\u2019ve been recommending them to all my family and friends.\u201d From $46 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest slipper booties\n\nAcorn Faux Chinchilla Slipper Bootie $39 (was $55, now 29% off) 4.2 stars, 1,054 reviews \u201cThese Acorn slippers are THE WARMEST slippers, not to mention the soft padding in the bottom that makes you feel like you are walking on a cloud, and the fuzzy inner lining. Another feature I liked about these slippers was the rubber sole. I don\u2019t have to be afraid of ruining the bottom of my slippers when I go on the porch or take a bag of trash outside. Also, I am not the most graceful person, so I need all the traction I can get.\u201d From $39 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
