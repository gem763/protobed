(AP) - The Tampa Bay Lightning have signed restricted free agent forward Brayden Point to a $20.25 million, three-year contract on Monday.\n\nPoint will count $6.75 million against the salary cap through the 2022-23 season. Point\u2019s contract ends a long stalemate with the Lightning that caused the budding 23-year-old star to miss most of training camp.\n\nPoint put up 92 points last season for the Presidents\u2019 Trophy-winning Tampa Bay Lighting, who were swept in the first round of the playoffs but are again favored to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nSigning Point was the last item on general manager Julien BriseBois\u2019 offseason checklist. Steve Yzerman\u2019s replacement extended Vezina Trophy winning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy with a $76 million, eight-year contract, added Curtis McElhinney as backup goalie, made bargain signings with Kevin Shattenkirk and 2019 Cup winner Patrick Maroon and kept Tampa Bay\u2019s skilled core together under the $81.5 million cap.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Tampa Bay Lightning have signed restricted free agent forward Brayden Point to a $20.25 million, three-year contract on Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/lightning_point_hockey_55379_c0-231-3828-2462_s1770x1032.jpg?21d0474b9929af065f412de105eb5f2dbee28123", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
