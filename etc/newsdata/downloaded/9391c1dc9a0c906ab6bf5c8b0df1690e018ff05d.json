Anthony [Martial] has been out for eight weeks now. So he\u2019s had to play loads more football than I\u2019d hoped,\u2019 Solskjaer told Sky Sports.\n\nAnthony Martial is in contention to feature against Liverpool after missing eight games through injury (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Marcus is a centre forward who can play left, right and as a No 10. He wants to be able to play all the positions. I want him to be facing the goal, I want to be direct and attacking quickly, so at the moment I see him coming in off the left or as part of a two up front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Marcus\u2019 movement is great, but maybe we just need to give him a game or two of rest because he\u2019s played a lot. Sometimes, because he\u2019s a young boy with lots of expectations on his shoulders, he\u2019s played four or five seasons now, and yet he\u2019s still not even 22 yet.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a scorer of great goals, as he did for England. I want him to become a great goalscorer \u2013 and that\u2019s a different mentality. At the moment, he\u2019s learning his trade.\u2019\n\nMartial has been out of action since August and has missed eight games in total but is in contention to feature in Sunday\u2019s heavyweight clash against Liverpool at Old Trafford.\n\nAnd, given he has effectively missed two month, Solskjaer admits he is unlikely to pair the France international with Rashford against the current Premier League leaders.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll need to make a decision on Anthony,\u2019 he added. \u2018He\u2019s not trained with us yet, he\u2019s still working with the physios and the fitness coaches.\n\n\u2018Marcus hasn\u2019t come back from internationals yet, so we\u2019re probably not ready to play the two of them together. They might have to share the load.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer defends Ed Woodward over Manchester United\u2019s transfer strategy\n\nMORE: Manchester United ready to deliver Ole Gunnar Solskjaer six top signings before next season starts", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits Marcus Rashford needs to change his mentality if he is to become a prolific goalscorer.
