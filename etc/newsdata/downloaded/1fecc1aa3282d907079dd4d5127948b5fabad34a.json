Well no longer! Randy Barnett and Josh Blackman have created a new way to study the Supreme Court that is accessible to anyone that is trying learn more about constitutional law, but it is an especially great resource for students. An Introduction to Constitutional Law teaches the narrative of constitutional law as it has developed over the past two centuries.\n\nAll students, even those unfamiliar with American history, will learn the essential background information to grasp how this body of law has come to be what it is today. An online library of enriching videos that utilize photographs, maps, and audio from the Supreme Court bring these important decisions to life. This book and videos can be used by students to prepare for class or lectures, as study material, and come exam time, students can watch the entire canon of constitutional law in twelve hours.\n\nPlease join us for discussion with Randy Barnett and Josh Blackman to learn about their new book!\n\n~ Books will be available for purchase and to be signed by the authors. ~\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-576841622.jpg?itok=FokEWXk-", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
