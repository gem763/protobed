It's hard not to think the walls are closing in on BP.\"\n\nBP spends \u00a37.5 million per year on arts and culture sponsorship, which includes deals with the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIt cut its sponsorship of the Tate art galleries in 2016, but said the decision was not a result of protests by climate activists.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
