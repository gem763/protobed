I mean, the French Open for me is very special because I\u2019m French-speaking,\u201d said the 36-year-old, who was part of Europe\u2019s 2012 Ryder Cup-winning team in the \u2018Miracle at Medinah\u2019, but has since slipped to 424th in the world rankings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for I don\u2019t know how many years. It\u2019s been a long road.\n\n\u201cSo many people have supported me over the years. That\u2019s why I get so emotional. I went through ups and downs for so many years now.\u201d\n\nIt was Colsaerts\u2019 third European Tour triumph in total and his first since the Volvo World Match Play Championship in May 2012.\n\nThe return to the winners\u2019 circle also secures his tour card for the next two years, having started the week 114th in the Race to Dubai standings, perilously just inside the top 117 who qualify automatically for next season.\n\n\u2013 Colsaerts stumbles \u2013\n\nColsaerts got off to a dream start with a birdie on the first as Coetzee made bogey, opening up a five-shot lead over his playing partner.\n\nThe Belgian then stumbled as world number 289 Coetzee reeled off three straight birdies around the turn to seize a one-shot advantage.\n\nA brilliant chip-in for eagle on the par-five 14th put Colsaerts back into the lead, with a shoot-out against Coetzee over the treacherous last four holes on the 2018 Ryder Cup course seeming inevitable.\n\nBut the South African struck a horrible tee shot into the water on the 15th and made a triple-bogey. Colsaerts also found the lake and dropped two shots to leave Hansen, playing in the penultimate group, in the lead.\n\nThe Dane, bidding for a maiden victory on the European Tour, then threw away his chances though by putting the ball over the 17th green and taking a double-bogey of his own.\n\nColsaerts stood on the 18th tee needing a par to finally put the tournament to bed and he managed just that.\n\n\u201cTo lock it in like this on 18, which is one of the most difficult par-fours on tour, is very satisfying,\u201d added Colsaerts.\n\nCoetzee finished third on 10-under after a level-par 71, one shot behind Hansen, who carded a 68.\n\nAmerican Kurt Kitayama continued his strong season by placing fourth, while two-time major champion Martin Kaymer claimed his first top-five finish on the European Tour since last November.", "description": "Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (France) (AFP) \u2013 Nicolas Colsaerts held on to seal a gripping one-shot victory over Denmark\u2019s Joachim B Hansen at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/889027_colsaerts-ended-his-year-wait-european-tour-title-colsaerts-wins-french-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
