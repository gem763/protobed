The patent application, which was first spotted by Apple Insider, outlines how the \u201cadjustable decoration\u201d could respond to events such as \u201cincoming communication\u201d or \u201ca calendar reminder\u201d by changing its appearance or flashing to attract your attention.\n\nIt\u2019s not an entirely new idea. We saw a similar feature make an appearance on the Razer Phone 2 last year, and the Motorola One Zoom uses its rear Motorola logo as a notification light rather than a fingerprint sensor as in previous models. It\u2019s not a huge feature, but it\u2019s helpful if you want to know you\u2019re not missing anything important while your phone is facedown on a desk or table.\n\nApple dropped the illuminated logo from the MacBook in 2015\n\nThe feature makes sense for Apple\u2019s products. After all, the company has a history of illuminating its logo on its older MacBooks, even if it dropped the design feature with the laptop\u2019s 2015 redesign. It wouldn\u2019t be a massive leap for it to bring back its illuminated logo with a little practical functionality added.\n\nThe application makes frequent references to \u201ccellular telephone\u201d calls as part of its description, which heavily suggests that Apple is considering using the feature on a future iPhone. However, the patent also includes images showing a series of \u201cillustrative electronic devices\u201d including a laptop, a tablet, and what appears to be an iMac.\n\nAs is always the case with Apple patents, it\u2019s best to read this with a healthy degree of skepticism. Just because Apple has considered a feature doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019ll include it in any of its products in the near future. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want this to happen, if only to see the company\u2019s glowing logo make a long-overdue return.", "description": "Apple has been awarded a patent to use the logo on the back of its phones as a notification light.
