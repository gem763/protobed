Riley, University of Alabama\u2019s assistant vice president and dean of students, that show [shocked face::gasp] that a leftwing university educrat holds doctrinaire woke leftwing beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, people holding that kind of philosophy should not be allowed within a thousand or so miles of any educational institution because his callous, privileged bigotry is going to be evident any time he has to deal with a white student or a conflict between a black student and a student of any other race or when he has to interact with campus police, particularly when either the cop or the student is white and the other isn\u2019t. That said, there is nothing terribly exotic about his point of view in progressive circles. The New York Times has hired opinion writers with much worse on their Twitter timeline .\n\nBut, for whatever reason, Breitbart hit the sweet spot here and within 24-hours an embedded educrat was able to devote more time to fine tuning his bigotry\n\nJackson Fuentes, press secretary for the UA Student Government Association, confirmed at 4:15 p.m. that Riley is no longer working at the University. \u201cFor us right now, basically all I can tell you is that the University and Dr. Riley have mutually agreed to part ways,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cSo yeah, that\u2019s true, and we do wish him the best.\u201d In an email at 5:03 p.m., assistant director of the Division of Strategic Communications Chris Bryant released an official statement on behalf of the University confirming Riley\u2019s resignation. \u201cDr. Jamie Riley has resigned his position at The University of Alabama by mutual agreement,\u201d Bryant said in the email. \u201cNeither party will have any further comments.\u201d\n\nRobbie Soave at Reason takes it from there:\n\nMany pundits on the right constantly inveigh against cancel culture: the drive to shame, punish, and ultimately destroy people for having said something trivially offensive at some point. Comedian Dave Chapelle torched cancel culture in his recent Netflix special, and conservatives applauded. The clip of Chapelle scornfully imitating cancellers has been all over right-leaning media for the last two weeks. I very much agree that cancel culture is bad. (In fact, it\u2019s one of the main themes of my book.) But as long as the right is perfectly willing to enforce its own version of political correctness, it is difficult to to believe that they really agree in principle that you shouldn\u2019t do this kind of thing. If you only defend the cancelled when you agree with them, then you\u2019re not actually against cancelling. You\u2019re just protecting your tribe. Conservatives, please condemn Breitbart for this hit job and demand the immediate reinstatement of James Riley.\n\nUmmm, no. Not just no thanks, but no f***ing thanks at all.\n\nIn this case, you can even\u2013without having a \u201cfirst class mind\u201d\u2013easily hold, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, these two opposing thoughts.\n\nOn the one hand, we should all deplore the \u201ccancel culture.\u201d It is corrosive of civil society and it forces you to limit social contacts to people who are pretty like-minded because you have to be attuned to the fact that there is no such thing as a progressive who will not burn you down if you say an unguarded word. On a personal level, I\u2019ve slowly removed from my social circle anyone whose politics I distrust because the risk of being around them is simply too great.\n\nI know many of \u201cthe canceled.\u201d They\u2019ve lost jobs. Been rendered unemployable because google never forgets. They\u2019ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts. Many times the court of public opinion handed out a verdict before they even had a chance to defend themselves. \u2014 Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) September 6, 2019\n\nOr even worse\u2014you justify why these people \u201cdeserve it\u201d in which case you\u2019re part of the problem. \u2014 Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) September 6, 2019\n\nSaying cancel culture isn\u2019t a thing because people rich & famous enough to weather the storm can survive it ignore the real life people who can\u2019t. \u2014 Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) September 6, 2019\n\nThen we need only to look at the saga of Leif Olson where a major center-left outlet fabricated stuff to get a guy they didn\u2019t like fired to understand the utter righteousness of Breitbart\u2019s action.\n\nSoave presents us with a false dichotomy. We can either actively work against a outlet that is (mostly) an ally to try to get a rabid, frothing leftist bigot reinstated. Or we\u2019re hypocrites. That\u2019s simply bullsh**.\n\nThe real issue is more analogous to the standoff between the US (that would be us) and the USSR (that would be their fellow travelers who masquerade as Americans today). The US was beset throughout the Cold War with people who claimed we should engage in unilateral nuclear disarmament because that would show the we really had no ill intent. I mean, if we didn\u2019t intend to use nukes on the USSR then we really didn\u2019t need several thousand of them, did we? (Bizarrely enough, you hear the same cretins and their philosophical descendants making the same argument about why the DPRK should not be expected to give up its nukes.) Under Reagan we were scolded that if we build better nukes (the neutron bomb) and developed SDI then we would be hypocrites. It didn\u2019t take a genius to see that a) building nukes and SDI was necessary for our survival and b) holding them did not compromise our principles.\n\nWe have a situation where the left and their fluffers in the media hunt through the history of conservative and GOP figures and find anything they can to take them out. This is demonstrated best by the dynamic of MMFA and CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski aka @KFile. So long as this kind of thing is permitted and rewarded, then we on the right have a very binary choice to make. We either unilaterally disarm and follow the lead of the \u201cmuh principles\u201d gang, or we fight fire with fire.\n\nTo make matters worse, we have people who don\u2019t really have our best interests at heart lecturing us on how we\u2019re violating our principles by defending ourselves.\n\nOne of the worst arguments I hear conservatives make in defense of the right de-platforming the left is \"we are just making the left play by their own rules.\" They are no longer the left's rules, if you are enforcing them. Then they are your rules. https://t.co/cFEpWjPFzK \u2014 Robby Soave (@robbysoave) September 6, 2019\n\nSorry, that dog ain\u2019t going to hunt. We\u2019re wise to that game. A couple of years ago a writer going by the nom de guerre Warden at Ace of Spades laid it out perfectly:\n\nThere\u2019s a frustrating game that the left plays with conservatives. It\u2019s an Alinksy tactic called, \u201cMake them live up to their values.\u201d Now, living up to one\u2019s values isn\u2019t a bad thing, but setting high standards ultimately means that you\u2019ll sometimes fall short. The left loves to exploit these shortcomings\u2013every Christian who falls short of perfection is a hypocrite; the social values candidate you voted for just got arrested for drunk driving. Haha, everything you believe and advocate is now discredited. \u2026 It\u2019s this that sent me to a place from which I\u2019ll never return. I literally don\u2019t care what Donald Trump does because nothing he can do is worse than what they\u2019ve already done. Donald Trump isn\u2019t the bully; he only insults and abuses people in power who have attacked him. They\u2019re the fucking bullies. The left, with their smears, their witch hunts, their slanders, their insults, their riots, their violence, and their weaponizing of the federal bureaucracy. There aren\u2019t any rules anymore because the left only applies them one way. And in doing so, they\u2019ve left what once was a civil compact between the two parties in smoldering ruins. I have no personal investment in Donald Trump. He is a tool to punish the left and roll back their ill-gotten gains, no more and no less. If he succeeds even partially in those two things, then I\u2019ll consider his election a win. Further, I no longer have any investment in any particular political values, save one: The rules created by the left will be applied to the left as equally and punitively as they have applied them to the right. And when they beg for mercy, I\u2019ll begin to reconsider. Or maybe not. Because fuck these people. This new philosophy has freed me of more emotional angst that I can describe. Literally nothing the left says or does matters to me anymore. I don\u2019t care about their tantrums. I don\u2019t care about their accusations. I don\u2019t care if they say Trump is lying. I don\u2019t care if Trump is lying. They created this Frankenstein. They own it. I am free of all obligation. I will never play defense again. I will attack, attack, attack, attack using their own tactics against them until they learn their lesson. What I will not do is let them play my values against me ever again. I don\u2019t need to prove that I\u2019m better than them. I already know it.\n\nSo no, we\u2019re not going to criticize Breitbart on this. No, we\u2019re not going to demand that this Riley character be reinstated. No, we\u2019re not going to defend figures on the left from suffering the same consequences anyone on the right would suffer under similar circumstances. Yes, we are going to do whatever we can to burn down anyone on the left who looks even vaguely vulnerable. And when y\u2019all get tired of this tit-for-tat bullsh**, let us know and we can talk about next steps, but for right now it is strictly #NewRules, baby.\n\nEnjoy your New Rules. When you want to go back to the Old Rules, let me know. I'd like that. Until then, hey, consequences, player. https://t.co/vQ1qohJaOz \u2014 Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) July 20, 2018\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see?
