They also might not live close to you in real life so having a long-distance relationship puts strain on the relationship.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: REX)\n\nOur expert added: \"Things will definitely seem less romantic once leaving the idyllic setting too (i.e. goodbye sun and relaxation and hello English weather and being very busy with the fame aftermath).\n\n\"The programme is set up to give people fame, popularity and Instagram followers. There is less emphasis on purely finding a partner than there might have been in the early days of the show.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
