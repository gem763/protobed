Now they must leave Iraq and Afghanistan | Simon Jenkins", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump is right to extricate the US from Syria. American troops have no strategic reason to be in that country. If they stayed any longer they would only be sucked in deeper \u2013 if they tried to impose a sort of peace, they would be attacked by all sides. The outside world has no dog in the Turkish-Kurd fight.\n\nThe US should get out of Syria as it must leave Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.\n\nTrump has been emphatic about withdrawal, but his unpredictability and aggressive rhetoric has muddied his intentions\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s motives or thought process for the latest move aren\u2019t exactly clear \u2013 as ever \u2013 that he has enraged conservative and liberal interventionists alike is as reassuring as it is alarming. Belligerent meddling is now embedded in the west\u2019s world view. But just as there is rarely a good time to intervene in other people\u2019s troubles, so there is rarely a good time to stop. Were there a way in which a US army could swiftly bring peace and concord to northern Syria it might be different. There is none. Nothing in the modern history of the Middle East \u2013 not the Taliban or the Saddam or Assad regimes \u2013 has equalled the horror unleashed by the US\u2019s \u201cwars of 9/11\u201d. They have come to seem as interminable as they are unspeakable.\n\nAs in any intervention, narratives evolve and alliances are formed. Most foolish was the encouragement and aid offered since 2015 to rebels in the Syrian civil war fighting against Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a war which David Cameron was inexplicably eager to have the UK join. As northern Iraq descended into chaos and the Kurds were emboldened to increase their pressure on Turkey, Syria became the venue for a nightmare three-way conflict. Throughout it, the US backed the Kurds.\n\nThe two most recent presidents, Barack Obama and Trump, came to office firmly in favour of withdrawing from the region. But the US\u2019s military-industrial complex proved too powerful for them. Trump has been particularly emphatic about this, but his unpredictability and aggressive rhetoric has muddied his intentions. He has played hard and soft with Iran, tried to leave Afghanistan but not dared to do so, and now leaves the Kurds in the lurch.\n\nTrump and Erdo\u011fan risk a resurgent Isis thanks to their recklessness in Syria | Hassan Hassan Read more\n\nWhen the outside world was united against Islamic State, a degree of strategic clarity was possible. Now Isis has, more or less, been bombed to pieces and older feuds have resurfaced. Trump has had enough. His desertion of the Kurds and his licence to Turkey to invade Syria must rank high in the annals of diplomatic treachery \u2013 but for realpolitik they are hard to fault.\n\nThus go all interventions. In seeking to mimic the global policing role of Europe\u2019s 19th-century empires, American foreign policy has become an angel of disaster. Cities ancient and modern have been destroyed and religious faiths have been polarised and weaponised. Many people have died \u2013 possibly hundreds of thousands \u2013 and trillions of dollars have been wasted. It is as if the defeat of the Soviets in 1989 had cheated western armies of a third world war, leaving them determined to visit one on someone else \u2013 if not communism, then Islam. If Trump manages to end this self-defeating cycle, he deserves credit.\n\n\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The president\u2019s motive for abandoning the Kurds is unclear, but the continued US presence in foreign wars is a disaster, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins", "authors": ["Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4269a589a1b662f8c92faf5fe114c2e9ad1110/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=25f2b70afc64328d03c215462e3a4ebc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
