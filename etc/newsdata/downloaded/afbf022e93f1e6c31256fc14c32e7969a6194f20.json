Yes, this is obvious advice for the Democratic hopefuls, now careening down the campaign trail with much bluster.\n\n\u201cSen. Bernie Sanders wants to forgive all $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loans. Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to forgive almost all of it. Either way, it\u2019s a gift to those fortunate enough to get into college and who are now reaping the financial rewards of having a degree. It\u2019s a slap in the face to non-college educated working families who will pay the bills,\u201d writes John Merline, an editor for Issues & Insights.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have been falling over themselves to promise to decriminalize illegal border crossings and offer free benefits to illegal immigrants. Has any of them bothered to ask working families how much they\u2019d like that?\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cAnd all this is to say nothing of the party\u2019s embrace of every social trend, no matter how potentially disruptive it proves to be, or the eagerness with which they brand traditionalists \u2014 who once made up a significant portion of the Democratic Party \u2014 as deplorable racists,\u201d says Mr. Merline.\n\nRepublicans take heed, though. Opportunity beckons.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean these voters will pull the lever for Trump. What it does mean is that Republicans have a unique opportunity to reshape the political landscape. All they have to do is make sure voters know all about the Democrats\u2019 out-of-touch, elitist and massively expensive agenda,\u201d Mr. Merline advises.\n\nYes, well. Hm. \u201cOut of touch, elitist and massively expensive\u201d has a certain ring to it. The seven-word phrase could form the basis of a GOP strategic push to add a straightforward reminder of what the competition really has to offer.\n\nMATTIS: REAGAN WAS RIGHT\n\nFormer Defense Secretary James Mattis has been a steady force in the broadcast media this week, offering multiple interviews in support of \u201cCall Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,\u201d his new book published 48 hours ago by Random House and now No. 1 on Amazon. Mr. Mattis has made a point of not criticizing President Trump, which is refreshing. He did, however, talk of another president during a Fox Business Network appearance Wednesday.\n\nHost Neil Cavuto wondered about North Korea \u201cflaunting missile tests,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cThe president says they\u2019re not violating anything, but it does make you wince a little bit. What are they up to? Are they throwing it back in the president\u2019s face? Now, the president has a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. And he\u2019s building on that, patient with that. Are you?\u201d Mr. Cavuto asked the retired Marine Corps general.\n\n\u201cYes, I think, if we go back to when we were doing arms control, same subject but with Russia, the Soviet Union days, what President Reagan always called for was \u2018trust but verify.\u2019 I think in light of North Korea\u2019s background here, I think we have to go with \u2018verify, then trust,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mattis replied.\n\nOBSESSED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nOne party is driving the alarmist fixation on global warming and climate change.\n\n\u201cThe share of Americans calling global climate change a major threat to the well-being of the United States has grown from 40% in 2013 to 57% this year. But the rise in concern has largely come from Democrats. Opinions among Republicans on this issue remain largely unchanged,\u201d reports the Pew Research Center, which has conducted multiple polls on the trend.\n\nThe pollster says 84% of Democrats say climate change is a major threat to the country\u2019s well-being, up from 58% six years ago. Views among Republicans have stayed about the same: 27% in 2019 vs. 22% in 2013. In addition, 94% of liberal Democrats deem climate change a major threat, up 30 percentage points. There has been \u2018no significant change\u201d among conservative Republicans; 19% pay attention to climate change, up one percentage point during the time period.\n\nWhat drives all of this? Maybe it was former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s \u201cInconvenient Truth\u201d films. Maybe it\u2019s because climate change lends itself to hand-wringing narratives and alarmist news coverage. Whatever the cause, the Democrats thrive on climate talk, while Republicans offer a resounding \u201cmeh.\u201d\n\nMARIANNE\u2019S TEACHABLE MOMENT\n\n\u201cI know this sounds naive. I didn\u2019t think the left was so mean. I didn\u2019t think the left lied like this. I thought the right did that. I thought we were better.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Democratic presidential hopeful Marianne Williamson, in an interview with New Yorker Editor David Remnick about her experiences on the campaign trail, the criticism of her as a nontraditional candidate and suggestions she was into \u201ccrystal gazing.\u201d\n\nTHE GLEE FACTOR\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be happy?\u201d asks the Gallup Poll. \u201cShould Happiness Matter? Happiness can reveal more about a society\u2019s health than traditional economic metrics do.\u201d\n\nThat said, the longtime pollster has unveiled its new online Global Happiness Center which measures the official statistics.\n\n\u201cWho cares if people are happy? If you don\u2019t, you should. Improving and sustaining high wellbeing is vital to any population\u2019s overall health and to its economy. This is why Gallup regularly asks people around the world about their lives, including how satisfied they are with them and what they are feeling and experiencing \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 on a daily basis,\u201d Gallup advises.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFor the 34th consecutive week, Fox News remains the most watched cable network on the airwaves according to Nielsen Media Research, garnering 2.3 million prime-time viewers. MSNBC was in second place with 1.5 million, followed by ESPN with 1.3 million and HGTV with 1.2 million. CNN was in 10th place with 897,000.\n\nSean Hannity remains the ratings king on the cable airwaves, topping all competition with 3.4 million viewers on Wednesday evening of last week; In addition, presentations of \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d and \u201cThe Five\u201d made up 19 of the top 30 overall cable telecasts.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 45% of U.S. voters would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who \u201ctook a hard line against illegal immigration\u201d; 75% of Republicans, 43% of independents and 23% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 25% overall would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported getting rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; 10% of Republicans, 18% of independents and 42% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 23% overall would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported more immigrants entering the U.S.; 8% of Republicans, 18% of independents and 40% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 1,987 registered U.S. voters conducted Aug. 23-25.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
