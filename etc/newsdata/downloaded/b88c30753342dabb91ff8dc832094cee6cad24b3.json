For this first conference, the dual themes that they have earmarked are \u201cadoption\u201d and \u201cliquidity\u201d, two of the most relevant topics for the company.\n\nTo exemplify these themes, CoinMarketCap has invited a range of speakers who will expand the range of discussion into related industries, focusing on adoption. For example, Aliza Knox, MD of Cloudflare APAC, and Brett Gibson, Partner of Initialized Capital (founded by Alexis Ohanian of Reddit), will be sharing their unique perspectives on the crypto industry.\n\nSome familiar and respected names within the industry will also be gracing the event as speakers, including Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, CEO of Binance, Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer of Blockstream, and Mance Harmon, Co-founder and CEO of Hedera Hashgraph, among others. (You can find the full list of speakers here.)\n\nPreviously, CoinMarketCap had revealed that its enigmatic founder, Brandon Chez, will take the stage for the first time, together with Sunny King, the equally anonymous and incognito creator of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\n\u201cWe are floored by the support and enthusiasm that we have had from all parts of the crypto and blockchain ecosystem for an honest, accessible conference focused on adoption and liquidity,\u201d said Spencer Yang, VP of Special Projects at CoinMarketCap, who is leading the event, \u201cWe made event tickets free for all, so that anyone who wants to learn will be able to do so with no barriers to their education.\u201d\n\nThe Capital will also be streaming live on the site for interviews conducted on-site by DataDash, one of the most popular YouTube influencers in crypto, focusing on technical analysis; its stage will be hosted by IvanonTech, also an influencer, most famous for his daily updates and educational initiatives in the space.\n\nPlease find out more about the event in this initial blog post by CoinMarketCap.\n\nCoinMarketCap Conference page can be found at: https://conference.coinmarketcap.com.
