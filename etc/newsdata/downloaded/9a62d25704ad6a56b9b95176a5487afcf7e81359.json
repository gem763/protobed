General Barr is a dedicated public servant who did an outstanding job as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, as Deputy Attorney General, and as our 77th Attorney General during the administration of President George H.W. Bush.\"\n\n\"As he displayed during his confirmation hearing, General Barr is candid and has a no-nonsense management style, and his intelligence background will be an asset in our ongoing effort to combat terrorism and narco-traffickers. Bill Barr is a consummate professional who has the experience and credibility that is needed to lead the dedicated men and women at DOJ as they faithfully execute our nation\u2019s laws, advance the rule of law, and pursue justice at every turn.\"", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The\u00a0Heritage Foundation's John Malcolm, Vice President of the\u00a0Institute for Constitutional Government and\u00a0Director of the Meese Center for Legal & Judicial Studies, released the following comment in response to\u00a0the U.S. Senate\u2019s vote to confirm Bill Barr as attorney general of the United States:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
