Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a House Oversight Committee member who chairs the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington. \u201cThat was the risk from day one \u2014 foreign governments and others trying to seek favor because we know Trump pays attention to this\u2026. It\u2019s an obvious attempt to curry favor with him.\u201d\n\nThe investigation began after the committee received information that two entities \u2014 a trade association and a foreign government \u2014 booked a large quantity of rooms but only used a fraction of them, according to a person familiar with the allegation who isn\u2019t authorized to speak for the committee.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
