But within six months of the arrival of Albie, Kenny was back among the world\u2019s elite \u2013 making her international comeback at the track World Championships.\n\nShe herself admits she was a long way from being the athlete that won team pursuit and omnium gold in Brazil, and 18 months on has only recently started to feel back to her best.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There were a series of ups and downs because it isn\u2019t as simple as getting on a bike and it being OK again.

I never expected to be there and even at the European Championships last year \u2013 which was my first real target \u2013 I felt terrible. Even though I won two gold medals, I wasn\u2019t mentally or physically prepared and I felt like a fish out of water.\n\n\"Then, after slowly getting back into it in the World Cup season, I got ill at the World Championships which was difficult to take. But I\u2019ve had a really good summer and have put all that aside now. I\u2019m firmly focused on what I want to achieve in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nKenny hopes to compete in three races at next summer\u2019s Games in Japan, bidding to add Madison glory to her team pursuit and omnium tally. And with son Albie now a firm member of her supporters\u2019 club on the road, Kenny explains how important her support network has been in adjusting to returning to competition.\n\n\u201cMy life is completely different at this stage than it was before London or Rio. It\u2019s a logistical nightmare, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d added Kenny, who will call on the nation to share their messages of support \u2013 including social posts and videos \u2013 for British riders through a short launch video, ahead of the upcoming Road World Championships.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really lucky because both mine and Jason\u2019s parents have retired and moved close to us, to help us with Albie. They have to travel the world too, because if we\u2019re both racing, he needs looking after. That support is essential and is going to be crucial in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough when we\u2019re in the athletes\u2019 village, and I imagine Jessica Ennis-Hill will be getting a phone call or two. She\u2019s been incredibly supportive with helping me get back into the sport. I\u2019m sacrificing a lot being away from Albie, so I\u2019m eager to make the most of that time on the track, and I\u2019ll certainly be looking to do that in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nHSBC UK\u2018s People\u2019s Peloton encourages the public to share messages of support with the Great Britain Cycling Team to drive them to victory during the UCI Road World Championships.
