Each has a base rate for cash-back rewards, and then an extra 25% bonus on rewards if users fulfill certain requirements. Here\u2019s how they break down:\n\n\u2022 The Sallie Mae Accelerate card offers 1.25% back on all purchases, but people can get an extra 25% bonus on the rewards if the rewards are used to pay down any federal or private student loan. This can be done through Sallie Mae\u2019s mobile app.\n\n\u2022 The Sallie Mae Ignite card, which is intended to help college students build credit, pays 1% cash back on all purchases. Card holders can then unlock a 25% bonus on rewards earned on all future purchases if they make six consecutive months of on-time payments.\n\n\u2022 Finally, the Sallie Mae Evolve card offers 1.25% back on all purchases, but users will receive a 25% bonus on rewards earned for purchases made in their top two spending categories each business cycle automatically.\n\n\u2018Unlimited 1% cash back is similar to a handful of other student rewards cards.\u2019 \u2014 Nathan Grant, credit industry analyst at Credit Card Insider\n\n\u201c[W[hile others may add a \u2018student\u2019 label to an existing card, we co-created a true student card \u2014 Sallie Mae Ignite \u2014 with students, parents, and recent graduates and are specifically designed to promote financial responsibility,\u201d Rick Castellano, Sallie Mae\u2019s vice president of corporate communications, told MarketWatch. \u201cOur priority is to help students build credit responsibly and reward them for it.\u201d\n\nRead more: Wells Fargo and other banks charged college students $27 million in fees, buried CFPB report reveals\n\nThe cards have no annual fees, but do charge fees for late payments and foreign transactions. Each card has a 0% annual percentage rate period \u2014 6 months for the Ignite and 12 months for the Accelerate and Evolve. The interest rate then moves to a variable rate of between 14.99% and 24.99%. All of the cards come with cell-phone protection if the card holder pays their monthly wireless bill through their Sallie Mae card.\n\nHow Sallie Mae\u2019s cards compare to other products geared toward college students\n\n\u201cUnlimited 1% cash back is similar to a handful of other student rewards cards,\u201d said Nathan Grant, credit industry analyst at Credit Card Insider.\n\nFor instance, the Journey Student Rewards card from Capital One COF, +2.06% pays 1% back on all purchases and then an additional 0.25% back for making on-time payments.\n\nOther student cards are better for people who spend a lot in certain categories. The Discover it Student Cash Back card DFS, +1.12% offers 5% back up to $1,500 in spending each quarter in categories that rotate each month \u2014 and people who maintain a 3.0 grade point average can get an additional $20 statement credit each year. Meanwhile, the Discover it Student chrome offers 2% back on purchases at restaurants and gas stations.\n\nMeanwhile, students with good enough credit to apply for cards that aren\u2019t geared toward students could be better off going that route. \u201cFor students who can qualify for a flat-rate card that comes with 1.5% or 2% cash back on every purchase, like Citi Double Cash (2%) C, +2.16% or Chase Freedom Unlimited (1.5%), JPM, +1.69% these other cards could earn them more cash back over time,\u201d said Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet.\n\nAlso see: Wells Fargo and other banks paid colleges so they could market accounts to students, putting them at risk of high fees\n\nAs for making student-loan payments with rewards cash, credit-card experts stressed that this benefit isn\u2019t necessarily all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Borrowers who graduate with debt owe $30,000 on average. Making a significant dent in that with 1.25% cashback rewards would be challenging.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re talking about helping people or rewarding people for paying down their student loans, it\u2019s going to catch their attention,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to move the needle much because the cash back return on these isn\u2019t going to be huge.\u201d\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re just getting started with a credit card, you shouldn\u2019t really worry about rewards.\u2019 \u2014Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards\n\nWhat college students should consider when signing up for a credit card\n\nOver a decade ago, signing up for a credit card as a college student could be a dicey proposition because of problematic marketing practices on the parts of companies offering credit cards. The CARD Act of 2009 sharply reformed how companies could market cards to students.\n\n\u201cThe CARD Act made it harder to get a credit card before age 21, and in some cases even beyond,\u201d said Ted Rossman, industry analyst for CreditCards.com \u201cI hear of people in their mid-20s who get declined for credit cards because they don\u2019t have enough of a credit history.\u201d\n\nBuilding credit early is important, because it can make it easier later in life when you try to apply for other loans, including home mortgages. But it\u2019s important to have the right priorities in mind when signing up for a credit card.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best time it\u2019s ever been for earning rewards on student cards \u2014 virtually all of the major players offer some sort of student rewards card,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re just getting started with a credit card, you shouldn\u2019t really worry about rewards.\u201d\n\nInstead, experts recommended paying attention to other factors: Interest rates, fees and the balance accrued. \u201cCredit cards are serious financial tools that can help students build credit history if used responsibly, or can be a gateway to debt if used irresponsibly,\u201d Grant said.\n\nFor those struggling to get their own credit cards, a better option might be for a parent to add you as an authorized user on their card or to get a secured credit card that can prevent you from amassing a massive amount of debt. Both will aid in building one\u2019s credit score, while providing a life raft if the card holder falls behind on payments.\n\nRead more: America is one step closer to a government-backed account and debit card for college students", "description": "Sallie Mae has rolled out three new credit cards aimed at college students and recent graduates.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT178_gradua_ZG_20191011150054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
