(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nCtrl + N\n\nA California lawmaker wants to hold ride-hailing companies accountable after a Washington Post investigation exposed that Uber went to great lengths to avoid liability for passengers' reports of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nLorena Gonzalez, a Democratic state assemblywoman representing San Diego, tells me in an interview that she\u2019s now drafting legislation that would ensure Uber and Lyft properly investigate claims of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nGonzalez is considering mandatory reporting requirements for allegations of sexual assault after my colleague Greg Bensinger found Uber's internal investigators are forbidden to share them with law enforcement or other ride-hailing companies.\n\nIf a customer reports a crime, Gonzalez told me, it must be properly investigated. \u201cThere does need to be a responsibility to truly investigate,\u201d Gonzalez told me. \u201cThat's clearly not happening.\u201d\n\nGonzalez's plan to introduce legislation, likely in December, is just the latest sign that lawmakers are growing fed up with technology companies' excuse that they're just digital platforms -- and not responsible for the real-world problems that arise when people abuse their services.\n\nUber and Lyft have perfected this defense: They frequently argue that they don't employ the drivers -- but serve simply as the tech provider that connects them with rides -- so they can't be held accountable for their actions.\n\nBut Gonzalez says that if the companies want to take credit for creating a new way for consumers to travel, they also have to take the blame if people's safety is at risk.\n\n\u201cThey're trying to have it both ways,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're trying to suggest that they're creating this safe easy way for people to get around, but they want no liability when it comes to anything, whether it's work or pay or the dangers they're putting workers in or the dangers they're putting customers in.\u201d Gonzalez is also considering requiring background checks of drivers to include finger prints.\n\nUber announced this morning it was rolling out a suite of new safety features amid the increased public scrutiny, including a new feature in its app which would allow customers to report uncomfortable situations like erratic driving and invasive questioning, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports.\n\n\u201cThe core principle for us here is, underreporting is a big issue in every industry and we want to be able to help with that,\u201d Sachin Kansal, Uber\u2019s head of safety products, said in an interview. \u201cIf a user has a bad experience, we want to hear about that.\u201d\n\nThough Greg's investigation primarily focused on Uber customers who reported sexual assault and harassment at the hands of their drivers, Gonzalez says she's also talked to drivers who have experienced sexual harassment while working for the companies. Any legislation she introduces will include protections for both drivers and customers.\n\nUber told Greg that it doesn't report its findings with background check firms, law enforcement, or other ride-sharing businesses because it wants to be \u201csurvivor-centric.\u201d One executive told Greg that a survivor should be able to decide if they want to report their story to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re not the judge and jury to determine whether a crime has occurred,\u201d Tracey Breeden, Uber\u2019s global head of women\u2019s safety, told Greg. \u201cWe\u2019re here to gather information, make a business decision. We\u2019re not law enforcement.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, who has been leading the charge in California to require gig economy companies to make drivers their employees, says that change would give Uber and Lyft far greater liability for crimes that occur during rides. A bill she introduced requiring companies to reclassify workers essential to their business as employees \u2014 known as AB5 \u2014 was signed into law earlier this month.\n\nHowever, Uber and Lyft are planning to fight the law. Uber has said it will not automatically reclassify its drivers as employees when the law takes effect next year because they are not essential to its business.\n\nGiven this broader dispute, Gonzalez says that California needs an additional law on the books specifically addressing sexual harassment and assault at ride-hailing companies to ensure riders and drivers are protected.\n\nThe concerns about the companies' handling of sexual harassment have also extended to Washington, where Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is stepping up his oversight of the companies. He sent letters to both Uber and Lyft yesterday requesting information about their driver review policies. Blumenthal specifically said he was concerned about sexual harassment and assault, Greg reports.\n\nBlumenthal told Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that he was \u201calarmed by Uber\u2019s public statements about this issue, which indicate a brazenly careless attitude about your responsibility to your customers.\u201d\n\nA former Uber employee shared what it is like to investigate complaints of sexual assault and harassment \u2014 and what happens afterward.

In another Reddit thread, a person wrote, \u201cTrump just put \u2018Ukrainian CrowdStrike\u2019 into the consciousness and conversation of every normie that is following this story.\u201d\n\nThe vilification of Crowdstrike reflects how misinformation evolves in a complex media environment, \"mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president \u2014 owner of the world\u2019s loudest megaphone,\" my colleagues write.\n\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin and a former CrowdStrike investigator who worked on the probe into the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, told my colleagues. \u201cThis is absolute babbling to the president of Ukraine. It\u2019s hard to finger exactly which conspiracy theory he\u2019s subscribing to. But none of them have any grounding in reality.\u201d\n\nTrump has come to think the DNC server hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016 may have been hidden in Ukraine, people familiar with the president\u2019s thinking told my colleagues. It isn't the first time Trump has embraced a conspiracy theory, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how he reached that conclusion about the DNC server or how that would even have been physically possible, my colleagues note.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nNIBBLES: The Justice Department plans to launch its own antitrust investigation into Facebook\u2019s business practices, David McLaughlin at Bloomberg News reports. The new investigation will run parallel to one already launched by the Federal Trade Commission, signaling a growing turf war between the two agencies tasked with overseeing antitrust law in the United States.\n\nOriginally the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide antitrust investigations, with the Justice Department taking Apple and Google and the FTC looking into Amazon and Facebook. But Attorney General William P. Barr pushed to retain some oversight of Facebook and may make a similar play for Amazon, David reports.\n\nWhile sources say the Justice Department will focus on different aspects of Facebook\u2019s business from the FTC, the power grab hasn\u2019t been well received. FTC Chairman Joe Simons wrote a letter to the Justice Department about the issues, sources tell David. Simons acknowledged potential disagreements between the two agencies in a Senate hearing last week.

(Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nBYTES: Amazon is adding Alexa to everything from a ring to glasses, my colleagues Heather Kelly and Jay Greene report. The new devices will test whether customers are ready to trust Amazon with their privacy.\n\nAmazon senior vice president for devices Dave Limp spent the first 10 minutes of his presentation at Amazon's fall product event describing the company's privacy features \u2014 signaling how the issue is increasingly top of mind for tech companies.\n\nAmazon will now allow users to delete recordings on a rolling basis in addition to a recently introduced tool that allows users to activate deletion through voice commands. Users will also be able to ask Alexa what the device heard and why it took specific actions, Heather and Jay report.\n\nAmazon has also improved the accuracy of detecting when users say \u201cAlexa\u201d to wake the device to hear commands by 50 percent, reducing the number of recordings captured by Alexa, Limp said.\n\nUsers will have to opt in for the new privacy feature, however, which has drawn some criticism.\n\nMy colleague Geoffrey Fowler said:\n\nAmazon still doesn\u2019t get it on privacy.\n\n\n\nAlexa \u2018auto-delete\u2019 is not what we need to protect our privacy.\n\n\n\nWe need Alexa to not store our voices, our thermostat readings, our every on/off with smart lightbulbs IN THE FIRST PLACE.https://t.co/vDDOMOSako\n\n\n\n(photo by @JHBaran) pic.twitter.com/76LYMRVPQC \u2014 Geoffrey A. Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) September 25, 2019\n\nAmazon's continued push into products for children could also raise alarm among privacy advocates. The company announced it would introduce a messaging app for kids, my colleagues report. Consumer groups accused Amazon of violating federal privacy protections for children by collecting voice recordings on the Echo Dot Kids Edition earlier this year.\n\nThe changes follow a number of privacy gaffes for the company, including a Bloomberg News report earlier that year that Amazon gave contractors access to the Alexa recordings \u2014 some of which held personal information \u2014 without users' knowledge. Amazon also retains transcripts of Alexa requests after audio files are deleted, the company admitted to Congress in July.\n\nRANT AND RAVE\n\nTwitter greeted the announcement of Amazon's new Echo Loop, an Alexa-enabled ring, with a mix of confusion and curiosity.\n\nCNET's Bridget Carey:\n\nIf you told me Amazon was going to make a ring where you talk to your finger I would not believe you but here we are so clearly we ran out of ideas for new consumer tech products so I guess it's time to go home guys it was fun while it lasted. \u2014 Bridget Carey (@BridgetCarey) September 25, 2019\n\nUsers had differing ideas on how to incorporate the ring into your wardrobe.

The FTC sued Match.com, whose parent company also owns Tinder and OkCupid, for allegedly duping users into upgrading to paid subscriptions to access messages from matches that the company knew were from scammers.\n\nBetween June 2016 to May 2018, Match.com reported that nearly half a million customers subscribed to its paid services after receiving an advertisement touting a match with a fraudulent profile, which make up as much as 30 percent of its users, the FTC claims. The FTC is also alleging the company used deceptive marketing practices by promising users a free six-month subscription and by not disclosing all the requirements for redeeming the subscription.\n\n\u201cOnline dating services obviously shouldn\u2019t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nMatch Group said on its website that the lawsuit is based on \u201ccompletely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.\u201d The company reports that it catches and neutralizes 96 percent of improper accounts within a day. The FTC initially offered to resolve its claims with a consent order mandating certain changes in the company's business practices, as well as a payment in the amount of $60 million, but no resolution was reached.\n\n-- Today a coalition of 39 organizations and individuals sent an open letter to Congress encouraging lawmakers to create \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d for police use of facial recognition technology instead of banning its use.\n\n\u201cFacial recognition technology performs significantly better than people tasked with the same responsibilities,\u201d Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro said in a statement. \u201cBans on facial recognition technology put improvements in community safety in a standstill, blocking advancements that would improve both public security and law enforcement oversight.\u201d\n\nIn addition to ITIF, other signatories included the National Police Foundation and the tech lobbying group Computing Technology Industry Association.\n\n\u2014 More news from the public sector:\n\nGoogle refuses to pay publishers in France The announcement pours cold water on publishers\u2019 hopes of getting more money from Google after an EU reform of online copyright law.
