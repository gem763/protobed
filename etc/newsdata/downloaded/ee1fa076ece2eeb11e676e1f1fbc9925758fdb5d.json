That\u2019s because guilt coming from your kids \u201cis the most difficult\u201d kind to deal with, said Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. It\u2019s more stealthily devastating than guilt coming from other parents or society at large, Dr. Lakshmin said.\n\nThe first thing you can do to manage guilt (costume-related or otherwise) is to acknowledge that it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel bad that your child is disappointed, while also recognizing that complaints from your kid don\u2019t mean you should do anything differently. \u201cGuilt doesn\u2019t have to be a compass,\u201d Dr. Lakshmin said. \u201cIt can be just a feeling that you feel. And it sucks,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t have to be a moral judgment on you or your behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if I did force myself to make my child a subpar costume, she would probably sense the resentment simmering beneath that poorly-constructed vampire cape. \u201cSo much of what kids remember is less about the actual thing you\u2019re doing and more about how they feel when they\u2019re doing it with you,\u201d Dr. Lakshmin said. It\u2019s more important that I\u2019m present with her on Halloween, having fun and eating candy, Dr. Lakshmin explained, because that joyful family time is what she\u2019ll recall a year from now, rather than her disappointment about a store-bought costume.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to model good boundaries for your children \u2014 in fact, Dr. Lakshmin wrote an excellent piece for us about how saying \u201cno\u201d is self-care for parents. By saying \u201cno\u201d to some things, we\u2019re showing our children that we value our own time and interests, Dr. Lakshmin said. (One thing to note, though: If you have persistent, intense maternal guilt that is so extreme that it\u2019s your primary feeling, it may be time to check in with a mental health professional, as it could be a symptom of postpartum or clinically significant depression or anxiety.)\n\nI\u2019m lucky in that my daughter\u2019s best friend has a very crafty mother, who is willing to take my kid under her wing and teach her how to sew, so that someday she can make her own dang costume. The kicker? Her own daughter has very little interest in crafting. Maybe we should swap.", "description": "It\u2019s coming from inside the house.", "authors": ["Jessica Grose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/multimedia/parenting-costume/parenting-costume-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
