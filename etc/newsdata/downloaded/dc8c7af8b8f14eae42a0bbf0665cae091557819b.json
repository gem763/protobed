But despite that caveat, the Netherlands-based doctor who runs the site, Rebecca Gomperts, says she has received requests from American women since she began operations in 2006.\n\nThe study is based on women who inadvertently went to Women on Web rather than Aid Access, the site Gomperts later launched in March 2018 to prescribe abortion pills to women in the U.S.\n\nAfter examining the 6,022 requests Women on Web received from U.S. residents between October 2017 and August 2018, a team of University of Texas researchers determined that 76 percent of them came from people living in states that are hostile to abortion. Researchers used a 2017 state policy analysis from Guttmacher Institute to determine which states were \u201chostile\u201d and which were \u201csupportive.\u201d\n\nThe highest rate of requests came from Mississippi, where people seeking abortions must undergo state-sponsored counseling, receive an ultrasound, and wait 24 hours before a doctor can perform the procedure. Abortion is banned past the 20-week mark, save for instances when the pregnant person\u2019s life or well-being is severely threatened, or if there are fetal anomalies. Dilation and evacuation\u2014a common second-trimester procedure\u2014is only permitted under similar circumstances.\n\nMississippi is also a state with just one remaining abortion clinic.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that Roe v. Wade will be overturned or severely diminished has increased with the current composition of the Supreme Court,\u201d the paper reads. \u201cAmong the least advantaged, however, it is already clear that lack of access has compromised the right to choose to the extent that some are already seeking self-managed alternatives.\u201d\n\nAnd that includes those living in states with fewer restrictions: Americans from all 50 states have reached out to Women on Web for help ending unintended pregnancies, according to AJPH paper. What\u2019s more, researchers found that no matter what state requests came from\u2014a more restrictive one, like Mississippi, or a less restrictive one, like New York\u2014people seeking out Gomperts\u2019 services cited the same motivations: barriers to clinic access and a preference for self-managed abortion.\n\nExperts say these findings challenge common ideas about the ease with which people in progressive states can access abortion, and prompt us to imagine new models of abortion care.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis shows us that just because a state hasn\u2019t made abortion hard to get doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s easy to access,\u201d said Abigail Aiken, a lead author of the study. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a clinic right around the corner, someone still might not be able to take time off from work, find childcare, or afford the cost of the procedure. So even in more supportive state-policy environments, there is a need for this telemedicine model.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have hinted at the growing interest in self-managed abortion. A February 2018 study from Guttmacher Institute found that during the month-long period between May and June 2017, shortly after President Donald Trump took office, people in the U.S. ran more than 200,000 Google searches for information related to self-managed abortion. Twenty-seven percent of them reported that information pertaining to the search term \u201cabortion pill\u201d was most relevant to their search. And last month, in a report about abortion rates in the U.S., Guttmacher found that the number of non-hospital facilities that reported seeing people after a self-managed abortion increased by 50 percent between 2014 and 2017. The report suggests that the decline in reported abortions could owe in part to self-managed abortions.\n\nThese findings, combined with Aiken\u2019s research, reflect a broader cultural shift around self-managed abortion that has only occurred over the last few years. Whereas people once equated abortion outside of a traditional clinic setting with coat hangers and dangerous \u201cback-alley\u201d procedures, now it\u2019s more closely associated with buying pills online and taking them at home.\n\nThere are a few reasons for the shift, Aiken said. She believes there\u2019s a greater awareness that medication abortion is overwhelmingly safe and effective, even outside of the clinic setting, which has made self-managed abortion less stigmatized. Plus, the larger phenomenon of self-care has also normalized the practice of addressing physical and mental well-being outside of the healthcare system, as has the proliferation of telemedicine in general, which allows people to receive consultation and medication remotely.\n\nAnd to anti-choice lawmakers\u2019 chagrin, Aiken said the vast number of restrictions on abortion might be making people more open-minded about the different ways they can access the procedure. \u201cI think a lot of hostile state laws have had a paradoxical effect: They\u2019re intended to restrict abortion, but they\u2019ve actually opened up a lot of different avenues for people.\u201d\n\nAmy Merrill, the cofounder of Plan C, a site that rates online retailers of abortion pills, sees the evolving attitudes toward self-managed abortion as an opportunity to keep chipping away at stigma, and change the narrative around the practice.\n\n\u201cWe can start to reimagine all of these social norms around abortion methods,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cFor so long, self-managed abortion been perceived as a risky and dangerous last resort. But over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve reframed self-managed abortion as an empowered individual act.\u201d\n\nHave you purchased abortion pills online to end a pregnancy outside of the clinic setting?

Selling abortion pills online remains highly contested by the Food and Drug Administration, whose long-standing restrictions on mifepristone\u2014one of the drugs found in abortion pills\u2014require healthcare providers to administer the drug in person, at a clinic or hospital. Gomperts is suing the FDA for the right to continue her U.S.-based abortion pill service, Aid Access, which the agency ordered her to shut down earlier this year.\n\nGomperts told VICE she\u2019s simply meeting a need: In the first year Aid Access was live, she received more than 21,000 requests from women in the U.S. In a previous study, Aiken determined that more than three-quarters of those who received abortion pills from Gomperts resided in states with restrictive abortion policies as well.\n\n\"I sincerely believe there is a human right here to be defended,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is in accordance with all the human rights agreements that exist, as well as the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nGomperts\u2019 battle with the FDA coincides with escalating calls from physicians and reproductive health advocates, who are demanding that the agency lift the restrictions on mifepristone in order to reflect scientific consensus around the safety of the drug, and to expand abortion access.\n\nAiken says her team\u2019s newest findings only makes those arguments stronger. Until recently, she said, no one knew for sure how often self-managed abortion was happening, or if it was happening at all. Now there\u2019s a growing body of evidence that shows definitively that people are self-managing their own abortions, and might even prefer it to other forms of abortion care because of the privacy, convenience, and comfort it can offer.\n\nAiken and her colleagues argue that the only reasonable response to their findings is to make self-managed abortion as \u201csafe, effective, and supported as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore people are seeking out self-managed abortion as a first choice,\u201d she said. There\u2019s more than one model of ideal care for people now: Some people to have their abortion in a clinic, some prefer to do it at home. We need to meet people where they are.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Marie Solis on Twitter .", "description": "And it's not just because of restrictive state laws.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da75c93fa0c3f0009020ce0/lede/1571256012897-GettyImages-1308067.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.793xh;0xw,0.0294xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
