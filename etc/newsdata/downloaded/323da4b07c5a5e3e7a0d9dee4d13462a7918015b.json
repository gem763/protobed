(AP) - The white shaving cream from those celebratory pies was still stuck to Sean Murphy\u2019s hair.\n\nWho got him?\n\n\u201cEverybody, yeah,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHe sure gave the Oakland Athletics and his family plenty to cheer in a memorable major league debut.\n\nMurphy homered for his first hit and caught a shutout that meant the most to him - along with a key September win. Marcus Semien added a two-run shot two batters after Murphy connected, and the A\u2019s beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-0 on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nervous or I didn\u2019t have any anxiety out there, but once you\u2019ve settled in the game, of course the home run helps, I felt much better and much more comfortable out there,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMurphy drove an 0-1 pitch from Jake Jewell over the right-center wall in the fifth inning and replays showed his proud parents, Mike and Marge, cheering and celebrating in the stands.\n\n\u201cHit a homer, catch a shutout, not a bad start,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll probably tell you he\u2019s just as proud of the shutout as he is the homer.\u201d\n\nJurickson Profar also went deep as the A\u2019s slugged away to give Tanner Roark (9-8) plenty of support - not to mention sparkling defense.\n\nRoark pitched 6 2/3 innings, his third scoreless outing of the season. He didn\u2019t allow a run over six innings May 9 at the Coliseum against the A\u2019s while with Cincinnati.\n\nThe right-hander gave up five hits, struck out six and walked two in his sixth start for the A\u2019s since being acquired from the Reds at the trade deadline. Yusmeiro Petit, Joakim Soria and Liam Hendriks finished a five-hitter that took just 2 hours, 31 minutes.\n\nThe 24-year-old Murphy, a third-round draft pick by the A\u2019s out of Wright State in 2016, went 1 for 3 with a strikeout and was called for catcher\u2019s interference in the third, allowing Shohei Ohtani to reach and load the bases.\n\nRoark escaped unscathed by retiring Justin Upton on an inning-ending groundout.\n\nProfar connected for his 19th home run with an opposite-field drive in the second off lefty Patrick Sandoval (0-2), who worked just 3 1/3 innings because the Angels want to be careful with the rookie prospect. Sandoval allowed one run on one hit, struck out three and walked one while facing the A\u2019s for the first time in his career. He was coming off five scoreless innings with a career-best nine strikeouts his last time out in a no-decision against Texas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be on a restricted pitch limit the rest of the way,\u201d manager Brad Ausmus said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want his payload to increase too much over what he threw last year.\u201d\n\nThe Angels dropped to 3-15 in their last 18 games and have lost the season series to the A\u2019s for the first time since 2013.\n\nOHTANI\u2019S SPOT\n\nAs a starter, Ohtani batted in a spot other than third in the order for the first time all season. He was moved down to fifth.\n\nThe two-way star, who snapped an 0-for-14 funk with a double Tuesday, struck out three times as the A\u2019s hosted Japanese Heritage Night.\n\nPUK WAITS HIS TURN\n\nA\u2019s left-hander A.J. Puk hasn\u2019t pitched in more than a week, and Melvin is working to find the right spot for the 24-year-old prospect. Puk\u2019s first two major league appearances came in the eighth inning of tight games against the Yankees and Giants. Puk was charged with a blown save against the Giants, then steadied himself with two scoreless innings in a 19-4 win over Kansas City on Aug. 26.\n\n\u201cWe probably threw quite a bit at him early on,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI talked to him a little bit about it today. We\u2019ll get him in the right spot and we\u2019ll get him rolling.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: Ausmus hinted that All-Star INF Tommy La Stella, recovering from a broken right leg, might not be ready to rejoin the Angels in Chicago this weekend as hoped. La Stella hasn\u2019t progressed in what he is able to do rehabbing. \u201cHe still at times feels discomfort in the leg with certain movements,\u201d Ausmus said.\n\nAthletics: RHP Chris Bassitt is expected to rejoin the team Thursday after he and his wife welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter named Landry Jayne, on Wednesday. Bassitt will come off the paternity list and is scheduled to start Saturday against Detroit, two days later than his regular turn in the rotation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: LHP Jose Suarez (2-5, 6.71 ERA) faces Oakland for the first time in his career and looking for his first victory in 11 starts - the longest winless stretch by an Angels pitcher this year - since June 15 at Tampa Bay.\n\nAthletics: LHP Brett Anderson (11-9, 4.04) could set a career high for wins at 12, topping the total from his rookie season with the A\u2019s in 2009.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The white shaving cream from those celebratory pies was still stuck to Sean Murphy's hair.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/angels_athletics_baseball_40959_c0-119-4274-2610_s1770x1032.jpg?f96f64123a92e77f1ec483d844f12eb4b33dc1d4", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
