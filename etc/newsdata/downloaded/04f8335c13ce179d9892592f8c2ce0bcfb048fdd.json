The central case for his candidacy rests on the supposedly exemplary work he did as a senior member of Team Obama. Well, in 2016, acting as the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Ukraine, the vice president \u2014 unlike Trump \u2014 openly threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if the embattled nation didn\u2019t fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.\n\nAs Biden later bragged, \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMost of the media assure us that, though by the Democrats\u2019 new standards this kind of \u00adintimidation constitutes a flagrant abuse of power, Biden\u2019s reasons for threatening Ukraine were chaste.\n\nBut simply repeating this talking point doesn\u2019t make it true. Granted, Shokin was a shady character. Yet at some point he had been investigating Burisma, the largest gas company in Ukraine, which also happened to be paying Hunter Biden a $50,000 monthly salary as a board member.\n\nBy coincidence, Hunter had landed this cushy gig in a foreign country only a few months after the Obama \u00adadministration began dispatching his father, Joe, to the very same foreign country on a regular basis.\n\nThere was, of course, absolutely nothing in Hunter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to indicate that he would be a valuable addition to foreign energy interest. He didn\u2019t speak the language, and he had no particular expertise in the energy industry. Oh, he did have one thing, though: his last name.\n\nI suppose, that isn\u2019t entirely fair. Hunter once ran a hedge fund with his dad\u2019s brother, James Biden, and associated with a notorious Ponzi schemer. James would go on to snag a job as executive vice president of a construction company in 2010, despite having virtually no experience in the field. And only a few months into his tenure, the company would win one of its biggest contracts in its history, a $1.5 billion deal to build affordable homes in Iraq.\n\nBy pure happenstance, Joe was also the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Iraq at the time. Funny how these things work out.\n\nLiberal reporters, who are framing Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky as the most perilous threat in the \u00adrepublic\u2019s history, have shown little curiosity about Biden\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian government. Many media personalities, in fact, have rallied to \u00adBiden\u2019s defense, calling any intimation of wrongdoing a smear.\n\nNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd dismissed any Biden talk as a mere distraction. CNN called questions into the former vice president\u2019s actions \u201cbaseless.\u201d Other liberals now argue that the Biden firing of Shokin actually worked against the interests of Hunter.\n\nWe have no way of knowing if this is true, either. According to The New York Times, Hunter\u2019s work for Burisma had \u201cprompted concerns\u201d among Obama administration State Department officials, because it undermined diplomacy in Ukraine. Was Biden really the only person available to pressure Ukrainian officials while his son was raking in the cash? Does anyone really believe Biden\u2019s claims that he never once spoke to his 49-year-old son about business in the two years they spent working in the same country?\n\nNow, perhaps Hunter didn\u2019t break any Ukrainian laws. That doesn\u2019t mean a proper investigation couldn\u2019t turn up unethical or dishonest behavior. What we already know is that the Biden family business reeks of cronyism.\n\nWhen these allegations were recently brought up to Biden by Fox News, an indignant former vice president pointed his finger at the reporter and demanded he \u201cask the right questions!\u201d After being insulated in the Obama administration for so many years, it isn\u2019t surprising that Biden feels betrayed by any scrutiny. But despite the gaslighting of his allies, Biden\u2019s role in the Ukrainian affair is a completely legitimate line of inquiry.\n\nTwitter: @DavidHarsanyi", "description": "Whether or not Trump\u2019s ham-fisted conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rises to an impeachable offense, Americans have legitimate reasons to be curious about it \u2014 and the Biden family\u2019s blatant conflicts of interest abroad as Joe Biden seeks the presidency.", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-biden-hunter-biden.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
