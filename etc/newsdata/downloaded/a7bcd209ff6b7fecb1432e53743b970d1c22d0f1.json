The works will be on view from Nov. 23 to Nov. 25.\n\n\u201cThe sale and international exhibitions provide an opportunity to discover Ernie O\u2019Malley\u2019s private passion for art and the relationships he developed with artists he encountered in America and Ireland,\u201d Bernard Williams, a Christie\u2019s specialist based in the U.K, said in an email.\n\nO\u2019Malley met Yeats in 1937 at the Dublin home of art enthusiast and historian Constantine Curran C, Williams noted. The two became friends, and stayed in contact until they both died in 1957.\n\n\u201cBy the time Yeats became successful in the mid-1940s with a show at the Tate, O\u2019Malley already had some of his works in his personal collection,\u201d Williams explained.\n\nJack Butler Yeats RHA (1871-1957) OLD JOHN, 1904. Christie's\n\nThe son of artist John Butler Yeats and brother of W.B. Yeats, Jack B. Yeats started off as an illustrator and landscape painter, but his work became more obscure, according to the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nFor instance, The Enfolding Night (1947) \u201cis one of several existential subjects that Yeats painted in the late 1940s, as he approached his 80th birthday,\u201d according to Christie\u2019s. The oil painting, depicting four pale figures, three standing and one seated, on a dark, barren landscape, is estimated to fetch between \u00a3440,000 and \u00a3615,000.\n\nDeath for Only One (1937), showing a man standing over a corpse on a cliff top with the sea and sky behind them, was the first work O\u2019Malley purchased directly from Yeats. It is expected to sell for between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3530,000.\n\nO\u2019Malley purchased Evening in Spring (1937) from the artist in 1945. The piece may have been inspired by a family dinner in Sligo, Ireland, where Yeats spent some of his youth. The family is gathered around the table, with a centerpiece of yellow daffodils, and the green landscape can be seen outside the windows. Its price is estimated at between \u00a3440,000 and \u00a3615,000.\n\nMainie Jellett (1897-1944) THE LAND EIRE, 1940. Christie's\n\n\u201cThis is one of Yeats\u2019 most memorable and evocative paintings,\u201d according to Whyte\u2019s description of the piece. \u201cIt conjures up a feeling of nostalgia in the viewer through the richness of its color and the vivacity of its brushstrokes.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley wrote three books, On Another Man's Wound, The Singing Flame, and Raids and Rallies, about his experiences fighting in the Irish War of Independence from 1919 to 1921. He was also highly educated and interested in many different genres of art, according to Williams.\n\nIn addition to Yeats, he also collected pieces by Colin Middleton, Louis le Brocquy, Anne Yeats (the niece of Jack B. Yeats), Evie Hone, Mainie Jellett, Nano Reid, May Guinness, and Elizabeth Rivers, Williams said.", "description": "The works from the early 1900s to 1950s include five paintings by Jack Butler Yeats", "authors": ["V.L.
