According to the study, 38 per cent of people never use them, while 29 per cent employ them occasionally. In contrast, 28 per cent of single people use them regularly. Three per cent use at least one in every text, and 2.5 percent use more than one in every text.\n\n'Girls, women and other menstruators told us this emoji would help them talk more freely about their periods, which is why we campaigned so hard to make it a reality.\n\n'But this is only one part of the solution.\n\n'We know that girls around the world are being held back because of their periods, whether that's the one in five girls here in the UK who are bullied and teased, girls in Zimbabwe who have dropped out of school because the recent cyclone destroyed their period-friendly toilets, or those living in refugee camps in Bangladesh who can't access period products since fleeing their homes.\n\n'Period poverty will not stop until we fix the toxic trio of affordability of products, lack of education and period shame. We hope this emoji helps to keep the conversation going.'\n\nLast year, Apple said it wanted to improve the representation of those with disabilities\n\nIcons showing hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and guide dogs are among the latest set of emoji from the Unicode Consortium\n\nThe software update also includes the introduction of Apple's new Deep Fusion photography technology, which uses machine learning to take and quickly analyse multiple photos before piecing together the best parts into a single image.\n\nA new privacy control which enables users to opt-out of allowing Apple to store interactions with its voice assistant Siri has also been introduced.\n\niPhone and iPad users can access the new emoji by opening their Settings app, selecting General and then Software Update before confirming the installation of iOS 13.2.\n\nNew gender neutral characters have been added to the new iOS software update", "description": "Users will be able to select the ethnicity of each character in the 'holding hands' emoji, while a drop of blood representing menstruation has been introduced to fight period stigma. iOS 13.2 update.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20324558-0-image-a-32_1572352912832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
