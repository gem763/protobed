The Turkish offensive has attracted global condemnation, amid fears of a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Syrians have become internally displaced, dozens of civilians have been killed and hundreds of detainees have escaped from Kurdish camps and prisons \u2013 some of them relatives of Isis members \u2013 since the offensive began.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is absolutely clear that Turkey has a threat emanating towards it from groups such as the PKK, a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n\nA member of the German Bundestag spoke of his astonishment at Mr Wallace\u2019s remark and pointedly asked: \u201cIf you are convinced that Turkey has a legitimate reason for invading Syria, what would be your answer to the Turks if they were to ask you, in reference to Article 5 [which stipulates mutual support for Nato members] that Nato should support them?\u201d\n\nUK and other European special forces, present in limited numbers in Syria, had been working alongside the Americans, with the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Force (SDF). They have now withdrawn from northern Syria and will leave the country when US troops do so.\n\nThe Kurds on Sunday signed a security deal with Damascus, hoping to push back the Turkish offensive. Kurdish dreams of an autonomous statelet appear to be over.\n\nThere is, The Independent understands, a feeling of great unhappiness among many involved in the British and US mission to Iraq and Syria about what has unfolded.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In fact it\u2019s pretty awful after all they had done against Isis. But we are also in a situation now where there doesn\u2019t appear to be a coherent strategy in Syria.\n\n\u201cDecisions have been taken by the Trump administration which are very difficult to fathom.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what\u2019s going to happen now to a bunch of very violent Isis prisoners, whether they are going to become free again to carry on terrorist attacks,\u201d Sir David told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThese decisions also mean that Russian and Iranian influence will grow. I really can\u2019t see how this protects western interests. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nGeneral Sir Richard Barrons, the former chief of Joint Forces Command, who had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, lamented that Trump\u2019s decision has pushed the Kurds to turn to the Assad regime for support.\n\n\u201cThe move by President Trump to withdraw US forces was used by the Turks to go into Syria in the guise of a CT [counter terrorist] operation to attack who they see as their Kurdish enemy, and create a zone where they are going to put some of the millions of Syrian refugees in their country,\u201d Sir Richard said.\n\nAnkara sees Syrian Kurdish groups as an extension of the PKK, a group banned in Turkey.\n\nThe American move, Sir Richard said, \u201chas meant that the SDF has been suddenly left without support and this means they have had to turn to the Syrians\u201d.\n\nWith the Kurds it is a matter of treating allies with decency and honour. The Kurds did a good job against Isis, and this is not the way they should have been treated Major General Julian Thompson, former Commandant General of the Royal Marines\n\n\u201cWe will have to see just what terms Assad imposes on them \u2013 probably not very pleasant. The question we have to ask is what will others we will want as allies against a common enemy think of us? Would they think of the west as a reliable partner after this?\n\n\u201cYou have also got the question of Isis prisoners. A few of them will be taken to America, although we hear that the US forces were not able to get many of the \u2018high-value\u2019 ones because of the way the withdrawal took place.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the others? Of course if like Britain you strip them of citizenship you can\u2019t bring them back for trial. We know some of them have already escaped, with the Kurds focusing on the Turkish operation.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, nearly 800 detainees, many of them relatives of Isis members, escaped from Ain Issa camp in northern Syria, as Kurdish guards left for the frontline.\n\n\u201cAre these people going to face justice anywhere, or are these very dangerous people going to be turned out into the wild, to carry out attacks in Europe?\u201d Sir Richard asked.\n\nBut Major General Tim Cross, a Balkans and Iraq war veteran, believes that the US would have probably faced criticism whatever action it took.\n\n\u201cIf it decided to reinforce in Syria then America would have been accused by some of being bloodthirsty, of being imperialistic.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people in America want an end to foreign wars and Trump has tapped into it, he seems very determined to get out of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think what we are seeing here is a great division in western views. There are people in Paris and Berlin who say they simply cannot work with Trump. And then you hear people in America who complain about Europe not spending enough in defence, and on terrorism, it\u2019s Europe which is the target, and they say Europe should take the lead in dealing with it. This is a worrying division which probably won\u2019t be solved for the time being.\n\n\u201cAs for the Kurds, there are some good, some bad. But it\u2019s obvious what has happened in this case \u2013 the fighters we have been working with have been used against Isis, and then they have been hung out to dry.\u201d\n\nMajor General Julian Thompson, the commandant general of the royal marines during the Falklands, said that: \u201cThere is obviously a Turkish viewpoint on this. But the way they are going about things have opened them up to a lot of criticism.\n\n\u201cWith the Kurds it is a matter of treating allies with decency and honour. The Kurds did a good job against Isis, and this is not the way they should have been treated. The way it was done? Well that seems to be the way this man Mr Trump does things.\u201d", "description": "Senior former commanders in the British military have condemned the way Kurdish allies in Syria have been abandoned by Donald Trump, and have spoken of their deep concern about how the move has raised the threat of Isis rising again to carry out attacks in the region and beyond.
