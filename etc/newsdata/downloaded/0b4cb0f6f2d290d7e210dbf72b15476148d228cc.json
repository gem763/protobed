This is a story about one such cat.\n\nHelen was found as a stray 2-month-old kitten by Elizabeth Kronyak's friend and she soon found her way into Kronyak's home in New Jersey.\n\n\"This cat is different, this cat is special. I will regret [it] for the rest of my life if we don\u2019t keep her,\" Kroynak remembered.\n\nKroynak didn\u2019t notice at first that Helen was drawn to her singing.\n\n\"I must\u2019ve been singing something, because I do sing out loud all the time, and she came jumping at my face. I didn\u2019t put two and two together for at least the first two or three times.\"\n\nBut then she tried it out to see if that really was the trigger for Helen.\n\n\"I tested it out and when I started singing, she went from chilling to alert, and will just start running.\"\n\nKronyak's theory is that Helen is in \"prey mode\" and is acting as though she\u2019s hunting when she pops out to jump on her face.\n\n\"Cause she\u2019s a cat and because she\u2019s hunting, she\u2019s trying to be stealth,\" Kroynak said. \"So you have to pretend that you don\u2019t see her, because the second you break your focus and you make eye contact with her, and she sees that you see her, she stops. She won\u2019t attack.\"\n\nEven though Helen is mostly internet famous for accosting her mom\u2019s face, Kronyak doesn\u2019t mind one bit.\n\n\"I don\u2019t look at her as a cat -- she\u2019s literally my best friend,\" Kroynak said.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s a cat\u2019s world and we just live in it.\n\n\"I just want her to be happy. This is her apartment and I\u2019m just her roommate, so the whole cat attacking me when I sing thing, she definitely gets enjoyment out of it,\" she said.\n\nCourtesy Elizabeth Kronyak\n\n\"She\u2019s a sweet, sweet, sweet cat, but she\u2019s also just super playful. So, for me, I don\u2019t care if I get a scratch on me, I don\u2019t care if I wind up with a black eye. She\u2019s enjoying it and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\"", "description": "Elizabeth Kronyak's cat Helen pounces on her every time she sings out loud.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/helen-cat-ht-aa-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
