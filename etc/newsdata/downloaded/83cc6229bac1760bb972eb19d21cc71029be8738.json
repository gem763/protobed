(Picture: Cascade News)\n\nShe said the timing of the theft was \u2018very coincidental\u2019 and it \u2018may be linked\u2019 to the high-profile grant, which was awarded to train more volunteers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018The money taken out of the account said it was for seven Facebook adverts that we hadn\u2019t purchased.\n\n\u2018It came to around \u00a3870 \u2013 which is a ridiculous amount.\n\n\u2018When I found out, I was angry \u2013 angry that someone had stolen from the charity.\n\n\u2018It is very personal to me, and it is something very close to the heart.\n\n\u2018The fact that someone thinks it is OK to steal from a charity is disheartening, especially since we\u2019re such a young charity who rely on funding.\n\n\u2018We had a lot of things planned out and it might be a bit difficult to do it all now without this money.\u2019\n\nAbi is now appealing for other charities to be on their guard against online criminals.\n\nShe added: \u2018People need to be aware of cyber crime and how common it is. When I first found out, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do.\u2019\n\nMiss was formed in 2017, and became a registered charity earlier this year.\n\nIt helps scores of women through monthly meet-ups, a 24-hour phone service and fundraising events.\n\nThe charity only recently had its annual meeting and had formed plans to have a memory box for parents as well as further training for staff.\n\nBut the crime will now have a \u2018significant impact\u2019 on the aims, and the charity is reviewing its plans.\n\nMrs Clarke is hoping to get the money back, but said it could be a long process.\n\nA police spokesman said: \u2018We are aware of the matter and it is currently being looked into.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
