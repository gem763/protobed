Ms Charles said: 'We're not going to let it rest. This boy of ours was just too important'\n\nLast night Northamptonshire Police said it is preparing to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service and believe the driver may be charged with causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThe boy\u2019s parents yesterday vowed to pursue the driver to America if necessary to ensure she faces justice.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police said that the woman who was the suspect in the investigation co-operated with detectives in the early stages, as the police applied to the US to waive her diplomatic immunity.\n\nBut by September 15, she and her family fled the country. Mr Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, was informed by detectives shortly afterwards.\n\nIt was reported in initial findings by police were that Harry had been driving on the correct side of the road when a woman in a car pulled off of the airbase\n\nRAF Croughton is on lease to the US Government, which is using it as a state-of-the art spying station called the Joint Intelligence Analysis Centre (JIAC).\n\nAlthough police questioned the mother-of-three, detectives could not arrest or charge her because she claimed diplomatic immunity as her husband is an envoy to Britain. But last night, a spokesman for the family of Mr Dunn told The Mail on Sunday that the husband was actually a senior spy who was working in the UK using the cover of a diplomatic role.\n\nRadd Seiger, a British-based American lawyer acting as a family spokesman said: \u2018He was working at Croughton, which is a communications base, so he was working with intelligence which is, I guess, why it has been handled in the way that it has.\u2019\n\nThe car hit Harry (pictured when he was younger) head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\nHarry's mother, Charlotte Charles, (left with his father Tim) received a letter of condolence from US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson\n\nMs Charles, 45, yesterday gave a tearful interview demanding justice for her son.\n\nMs Charles, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said that she will meet Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab this week to demand that the unnamed woman be brought back to the UK. She told the BBC: \u2018We want him [Raab] to get her back.\n\n\u2018From me, as a mum, to her, we just hope that he can get through to her that we don\u2019t wish her any ill harm but we don\u2019t understand how she can just get on a plane and leave our family just utterly devastated.\u2019 She added: \u2018We don\u2019t understand how that can even happen and we are just really hoping the Foreign Office can get her back so we can talk to her and she can face any justice that our UK authorities are able to bring.\u2019\n\nMs Charles said that if the American woman was not willing to return to the UK, then \u2018we would probably go over to the States and do whatever we can over there. Our boy was just too important.\u2019\n\nEarlier, the distraught mother made a direct appeal to Donald Trump, saying: \u2018President Trump, please listen.\n\nTributes have been left for Harry following the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August 27\n\nThe car hit Harry head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please let her get back on the plane.\u2019\n\nMs Charles, who works in a GP surgery, said that the US government and the Ministry of Defence have until now tried to brush the death of her son under the carpet.\n\nThe incident has caused a diplomatic row between the British and US governments, with Dominic Raab saying that he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 by the way the Americans have behaved.\n\nMr Raab said: \u2018I have called the US ambassador to express the UK\u2019s disappointment with their decision, and to urge the embassy to reconsider it.\u2019 He added: \u2018I wish to offer my condolences to the family affected by this tragic incident. \u2019\n\nA US State Department spokesman said: \u2018Due to security and privacy considerations, we cannot confirm the identity of the individuals involved. We can confirm the family has left the UK.\u2019", "description": "Harry Dunn (pictured with mother Charlotte), 19, died after his Suzuki motorbike and the unnamed 42-year-old woman's Volvo SUV collided on a road near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.", "authors": ["Abul Taher And Ross Slater For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342390-0-image-a-21_1570307364478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
