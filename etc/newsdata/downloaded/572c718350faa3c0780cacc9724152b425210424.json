The 33-year-old turned up to her appointment in March 2018, told the practitioner she had pain in her neck and shoulder area, and was treated by way of needles inserted into her jian jing points, located at the very top of the shoulders. Later that night, she was in the local emergency department.\n\nStuff reports that the woman expressed pain as the needles went in and said that they felt \"extremely deep.\" They were left in for 30 minutes, and the acupuncturist reportedly rotated them before pulling them out. As they were removed, the woman said she felt a sudden pain on the right side of her chest and experienced shortness of breath. By the time she left the practice at 2:30 p.m., she felt \"very uncomfortable.\"\n\nThat evening, after resting at home and finding that the side of her chest was in pain and the right side was numb, the woman\u2019s husband took her to a medical centre and she was subsequently referred to a local emergency department. She was ultimately diagnosed with two punctured lungs.\n\nIn a decision released yesterday, Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill found that the acupuncturist breached the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights when they failed to tell the patient there was a risk of pneumothorax \u2014 that is, a collapsed lung \u2014 or get written consent before performing the risky procedure. He recommended that the practitioner pursue further training on acupuncture needling techniques, and provide the Commission with evidence it had been completed.\n\nIn response to the finding, the acupuncturist said she \"felt very sorry\" about the patient\u2019s collapsed lungs. It is thought that the low Body Mass Index of the patient \u2014 who weighed just 45 kilograms \u2014 may have increased the risk of complications.\n\nThe patient is reportedly still suffering the effects of the puncture.\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram", "description": "The 33-year-old expressed pain as the needles went in and said they felt \u201cextremely deep.\" Hours later, she was sent to the local hospital's emergency department.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d770377a9a046000842b3ce/lede/1568080776847-pjimage-2019-09-10T114427437.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
