REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nBased on the novel by Susanna Jones, the film follows Vikander\u2019s character, translator Lucy Fly, an expat living in Japan who begins a romantic relationship with photographer Teiji, played by Naoki Kobayashi.\n\nBut Lucy\u2019s life is turned upside down with the arrival of fellow expat Lily Bridges, played by Riley Keough, who befriends the couple. Lily disappears, presumed dead, and Lucy becomes the main suspect.\n\nWhile Lucy appears tough on the outside at first, her psychological fragility soon shows.\n\nThe film, which premiered at the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday, requires the Swedish-born Vikander, known for \u201cEx Machina\u201d and her Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d to speak in Japanese in numerous scenes.\n\n\u201cI wish I could tell you that I knew Japanese and I learned it in three months,\u201d Vikander, 31, told Reuters at the premiere. \u201cI mean I did an immense amount of work to be able to do the Japanese ... and being bilingual I know you can\u2019t just mimic words and sounds, you need to really know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I did everything from reading my scenes out loud in English and then we kind of reworked on translating them to really get the kind of sensitivity and the emotion and the subtext that I had in my acting, hopefully ... It was a lot of work.\u201d\n\nDirector Wash Westmoreland, known for dramas \u201cColette\u201d and \u201cStill Alice,\u201d said he was familiar with the setting when he was first approached about the project, having lived in Japan in 1989.\n\n\u201cWhen I started reading Susanna Jones\u2019 brilliant novel I just fell into it, just the psychology was so fascinating and the story\u2019s so unexpected and I felt, \u2018Aha, I can use this to make a neo-noir,\u2019\u201d Westmoreland told Reuters.\n\n\u201cEarthquake Bird,\u201d which will have a limited theatrical run, will be released globally on streaming service Netflix on Nov. 15.", "description": "Alicia Vikander plays a murder suspect caught in a love triangle in \"Earthquake Bird,\" a thriller set in 1989 Tokyo in which the Oscar winner performs in English as well as Japanese.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439442040&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992CF-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
