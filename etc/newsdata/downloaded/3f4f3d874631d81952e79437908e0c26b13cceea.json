Katie Hill announces resignation amid ethics probe", "language": "en", "text": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Democratic freshman Katie Hill announced her resignation from Congress Sunday amid allegations she engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a Congressional staffer.\n\n\u201cIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community and our country.\u201d\n\nNews of Hill\u2019s resignation came days after the House Committee on Ethics announced it had opened an investigation into allegations that Hill, D-Calif., engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a male Congressional staffer in violation of House rules.\n\nThe scandal erupted earlier this month when a conservative blog published intimate photos of Hill, alleging she and her husband had a relationship with a female staff member of her election campaign and that she had a more recent relationship with a male staffer.\n\nLast week, she denied the most recent allegation concerning the male staff member, but admitted to having had a relationship with the campaign staffer and apologized for it while blaming the scandal on Kenny Heslep, her husband of nine years and whom she is in the process of divorcing.\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d she said. \u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain.\u201d\n\nIn her letter Sunday, she said her resignation was to protect those who supported her from \u201cthe pain inflicted by my abusive husband and brutality of hateful political operatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our legal options.\u201d\n\nShe did not say when she will step down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that Hill, who was elected during the 2018 mid-terms, made \u201ca great contribution\u201d as a freshman Congressional leader but that \u201cwe must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued services as a member untenable,\u201d Pelosi said.", "description": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Democratic freshman Katie Hill announced her resignation from Congress Sunday amid allegations she engaged in an inappropriate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
