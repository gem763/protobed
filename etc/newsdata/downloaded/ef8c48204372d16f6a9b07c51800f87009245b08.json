(Getty)\n\nThat certainly doesn\u2019t look fine. Giant wraps like that don\u2019t indicate that everything is OK. But the Yankees haven\u2019t made any official announcements on the injury, so for now we\u2019ll have to take Chapman\u2019s word for it.\n\nCashman pleads ignorance\n\nGeneral manager Brian Cashman did acknowledge the injury to the Post, but appeared to be in the dark with the rest of us.\n\n\u201cI saw it when he walked by,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question on my mind. You know what he did? He gave me a fist-bump with the wrap on his wrist. So, I was like, what\u2019s that? But they were all going out on the field and he had a huge smile on his face. So I have no answer as to what that is. But I fist-bumped it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an odd substitute for an injury report.\n\nBut again, we\u2019ll have to take their word for it for now.\n\nGame 1 of the ALCS is scheduled for Saturday, so the Yankees have a few days off before facing the winner between the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nWe should know by then if there\u2019s more to Chapman\u2019s heavily wrapped left hand.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Baseball\u2019s long-held tradition of celebrating every playoff victory like a championship almost had serious consequences for the Yankees.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/w09daFgsaAPHE5zjWEG5oQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S_8L3IDTxpqJTnNlq6qR4Q--~B/aD0yOTQ1O3c9NDQxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e4ff35d0-e9f9-11e9-bfbd-9500c3aacd3a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
