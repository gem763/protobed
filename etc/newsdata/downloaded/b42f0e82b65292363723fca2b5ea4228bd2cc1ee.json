They have, however, been available online. That is, until now.\n\n\"We must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers,\" said K.C. Crosthwaite, JUUL's new CEO, and a former executive at Altria, the Big Tobacco producer that owns a fair portion of the vaping giant.\n\nTobacco and menthol\u2013based flavors, it should be noted, will remain on sale.\n\nThis policy shift comes at a time of a significant reshuffling at JUUL. Last month, the vape powerhouse changed leadership (installing Crosthwaite), pledged to stay out of the federal government's way, and vowed to no longer advertise in any capacity. JUUL also bowed out of a battle in San Francisco, where a ballot initiative it backed was designed to overturn a total ban on vape sales in the city.\n\nIn all likelihood, the company was trying to position itself to gain FDA approval, which it lacked even as it gained massive market share since 2015. Meanwhile, starting this summer, dozens of people died and more than 1,000 become sick with a mysterious lung illness tied to vaping, adding to scrutiny of the manufacturer.\n\nIt's tough to say how much impact on use\u2014by young people or otherwise\u2014pulling these flavors might actually produce. After all, when JUUL ceased providing retail stores with what many considered to be kid-friendly flavors, mint remained on the shelves\u2014and sales reportedly skyrocketed.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Alex Norcia on Twitter.", "description": "On Thursday, the powerhouse announced\u2014yet again\u2014that it was scaling back amid a national panic.
