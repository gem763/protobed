Five Nobel Prizes \u2013 for physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace \u2013 were established in 1895 by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.\n\nEach category\u2019s prizewinner is decided by a committee but their decisions, in retrospect, have not always gone down well. In some cases, the committees\u2019 decision caused controversy. Here are just some of the awards that are remembered, not for their contribution to society, but for errors or omissions.\n\nGreta Thunberg gets Nobel nomination\n\nPeace Prize: 1948\n\nThis prize was actually never awarded because Indian civil resistance leader Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated just two days before nominations for this prize closed. Despite being nominated five times, he never won.\n\nThe 1948 judging committee declined to award a prize, saying \u201cthere was no suitable living candidate\u201d.\n\nIn 1989 when the prize was awarded to the Dalai Lama, the committee said it was also a tribute to Gandhi. Today, its website describes Gandhi as the missing laureate.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nMedicine Prize: 1926\n\nYou might think this award should go to the person who cured a disease or for a proven medical breakthrough, but Danish scientist Johannes Fibiger won the prize for claiming a parasitic roundworm caused cancer in rats. In actual fact, a lack of Vitamin A in the rats\u2019 diet caused that cancer.\n\nIronically, his fellow nominee, Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, discovered that coal tar is a carcinogen \u2013 a substance that causes cancer, and this research helped prove that certain chemicals can cause cancer.\n\nPhoto: Wikipedia\n\nMedicine Prize: 1949\n\nPortuguese doctor Antonio Egas Moniz developed a type of brain surgery for treating mental illness called a lobotomy (or a leucotomy). It was seen as a new cure for different kinds of mental issues. But, rather than being a miracle cure, the procedure ended up being banned in many countries.\n\nShe saw Malala Yousafzai as an inspiration - now she's won an award named after her\n\nPhysics Prize: 1938\n\nOccasionally the right person wins an award \u2013 for the wrong reason.\n\nItalian nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, who created the world\u2019s first nuclear reactor, won the award for discovering new radioactive elements, but what he thought was radiation was actually nuclear fission, a very different process. Despite this error, his other great contributions to nuclear science make him a worthy winner.\n\nPhoto: Wikipedia\n\nChemistry Prize: 1918\n\nFritz Haber won the Nobel Prize for chemistry for developing a method of chemically producing ammonia, an ingredient used to make nitrogen-based fertilisers.\n\nBy applying these fertilisers to crops, farmers increased global food production, and reduced famine. However, Haber was also involved in the production of chemical weapons for Germany in the first world war.\n\nAs Alfred Nobel\u2019s main aim for these prizes was to further the cause of peace, Haber\u2019s award remains controversial.", "description": "From not awarding Gandhi to honouring a man who produced chemical weapons for WWI, the committees' decisions haven't always gone down well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/danishscientist.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
