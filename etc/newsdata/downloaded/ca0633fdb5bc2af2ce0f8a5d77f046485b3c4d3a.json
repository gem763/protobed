He's also been ordered to pay $8,486 (R51,000) in restitution to the zoo.\n\nProsecutors said Kasbar broke in to the Santa Ana Zoo in July 2018, used bolt cutters to open the lemur enclosure, and stole a 32-year-old animal named Isaac.\n\nSeveral other animals escaped after Kasbar broke in, though prosecutors said they were all captured.\n\nProsecutors said Kasbar then put Isaac in a plastic drawer that had no ventilation holes, and left him outside a Newport Beach hotel.\n\nKasbar attached two notes to the drawer: \"Lemur (with tracker)\" and \"This belongs to the Santa Ana Zoo it was taken last night please bring it to police.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac the lemur is OK\n\nIsaac survived the incident and was returned to the zoo uninjured. He turned 33 in July, according to CNN.\n\nRing-tailed lemurs, which are native to Madagascar, typically live between 20 and 25 years, court documents said. That makes Isaac a rare animal in an already endangered species.\n\nIsaac has apparently bounced back after the incident. Zoo staff have posted a number of pictures of him on social media, showing the aging primate enjoying snacks in the sun and posing for \"selfies.\"", "description": "Aquinas Kasbar, 19, broke into the lemur enclosure at the Santa Ana Zoo last year using bolt cutters, and nabbed a 32-year-old lemur named Isaac.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2500/b0465ae4a0274b038b2cec227f345aa9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
