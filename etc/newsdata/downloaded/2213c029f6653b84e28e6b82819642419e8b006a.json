SISAK and BERNARD CONDON Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City prosecutors have subpoenaed President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\u2019s office recently sent a subpoena to Trump\u2019s accounting firm seeking the last eight years of state and federal tax returns for Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Trump says Iran involvement in Saudi attacks being \u2018checked out\u2019 as he reiterates call for deep interest-rate cuts\n\nVance, a Democrat, subpoenaed the Trump Organization last month for records related to payments former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen helped arrange to the porn actress Stormy Daniels after she claimed she\u2019d had an affair with Trump.\n\nVance\u2019s office declined to comment Monday on the tax return subpoenas, the news of which was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe accounting firm, Mazars USA, said in a statement that it \u201cwill respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d\n\nThe firm said it believes strongly in ethical and professional rules and regulations governing the accounting industry and does not comment on work it does for clients.\n\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization, Marc Mukasey, said he is \u201cevaluating the situation and will respond as appropriate.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York and Washington spent months probing payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump, including Daniels and model Karen McDougal.\n\nCohen, who made one of the payments himself and arranged for American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, to pay the other, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and other crimes and is serving a three-year sentence.\n\nA lawyer for Cohen declined to comment.\n\nTrump, who denies any sexual relationship with either woman, has said any payments were a personal matter, not a campaign expense.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in New York informed a court last month that it was finished investigating the payments. No one besides Cohen was charged, though prosecutors said in public court filings that Trump himself was aware of and directed the payments.\n\nThe Trump Organization also reimbursed Cohen for money he paid to Daniels. Cohen has argued that organization officials disguised the true nature of the payments and that it is unfair he is the only one prosecuted.\n\nThe federal inquiry looked at whether campaign finance laws were broken.\n\nThe New York Times reported, citing \u201cpeople briefed on the matter,\u201d that Vance\u2019s inquiry involves an examination of whether anyone at the Trump Organization falsified business records by falsely listing the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense.\n\nFalsifying business records can be a crime under state law.", "description": "New York City prosecutors reportedly seek eight years\u2019 worth of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR404_trump__ZG_20190916165115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
