(Photo: Haley BeMiller/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2013 Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald still remembers what it felt like to see 2,000 people searching fields for any sign of missing teenager Jayme Closs.\n\nOne year has passed since Jake Patterson gunned down Wisconsin couple James and Denise Closs and kidnapped their only child. Some of the memories hurt.\n\nBut others, like that day in the field, remind Fitzgerald of how people came together to support one another, convinced every day Jayme would eventually come home.\n\nAnd she did.\n\n\"There\u2019s no reason to give up hope, and we proved that to the world,\" Fitzgerald said in a recent interview with USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\n\nJayme Closs smiles with the family pets at her aunt's home Saturday, two days after escaping from a cabin in Gordon in Douglas County. Authorities say Jayme was kidnapped 88 days ago when her parents were murdered in her Barron home.

The 22-year-old Patterson was sentenced to life in prison in May.\n\nPatterson didn't know the Closs family prior to the day he decided to kidnap Jayme after watching her board a school bus, fulfilling a fantasy of holding a young girl prisoner, prosecutors said. He is now imprisoned in New Mexico, although Wisconsin corrections officials will not identify the institution.\n\nFitzgerald said the community is moving forward and learning to live with a \"new normal.\"\n\nA town once consumed by search parties, media and signs pleading to find Jayme appears quiet one year later. People are more vigilant and aware of their surroundings.\n\nThe Closs family home is gone.

At a news conference Monday, Closs family attorney Chris Gramstrup said the teenager spent her summer hiking through state parks, reconnecting with friends and celebrating special occasions with her family \u2013 including her 14th birthday.\n\nGramstrup also read a statement on behalf of Jayme, who thanked everyone for the kindness and concern they have shown her.\n\n\"I'm very happy to be home and getting back to the activities that I enjoy,\" she said. \"I love hanging out with all my friends, and I feel stronger every day.\"\n\nGramstrup acknowledged the strength of Jayme's father and her mother's kind, caring heart, both qualities he said they passed on to their daughter. The people around her see her getting stronger, too, he said.\n\n\"It's her strength and her heart that has and will continue to get her through this and move forward with her life,\" he said.\n\nA new mission to find those still missing\n\nFitzgerald and Barron County District Attorney Brian Wright used Monday's news conference to thank law enforcement who helped the Closs family find justice. According to the sheriff, the seven-month case generated 32,000 tips, nearly 700 pieces of evidence and the longest-running active Amber Alert in Wisconsin history.\n\nFitzgerald, joined by the president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, also encouraged people to use the lessons of Jayme's case to help the 40 other missing people in Wisconsin. One woman, Sara Bushland, disappeared at 15 after she got off a school bus in Spooner in 1996.\n\nBarron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald speaks at a news conference Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, in Barron, Wis. Fitzgerald addressed the media ahead of the one-year anniversary of the abduction of Jayme Closs and the murder of her parents.

For 88 days, the community pushed for something to happen, and the sheriff believes people should channel that energy every day.\n\n\"I think we all need to take a bigger role in society and do something good,\" Fitzgerald said.\n\nAlabama girl remains missing: Police take man into custody after kidnapping of 3-year-old girl from birthday party\n\nFollow Haley BeMiller on Twitter at @haleybemiller.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/14/jayme-closs-one-year-after-her-abduction-shes-stronger-every-day/3976623002/", "description": "One year has passed since Jake Patterson gunned down Wisconsin\u00a0couple James and Denise Closs and kidnapped their only child.", "authors": ["Haley Bemiller", "Published P.M.
