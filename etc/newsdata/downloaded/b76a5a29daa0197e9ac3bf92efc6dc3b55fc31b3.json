Turkey has long wanted the U.S. to end its support for the Kurds, an ethnic group the Turkish government views as terrorists.\n\nThe White House\u2019s announcement Sunday to allow Turkey to invade northern Syria startled some members of Congress, who warned such a move could lead to a genocide of the Kurds and allow ISIS to creep back into the region.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent cheerleader of the president, split with Trump on his Syria decision, calling it \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d during a phone interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday.\n\nLindsey Graham calls in to Fox & Friends & calls Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds \"impulsive.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted & irresponsible this decision is in my view,\" he says. \"This to me is just unnerving to its core.\" pic.twitter.com/URH0DVA1bo \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nGraham, who helped to convince Trump to reverse his decision last December to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, tweeted Monday that abandoning our Kurdish allies would be \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nHe said he plans to introduce a Senate resolution opposing and asking for a reversal of Trump\u2019s decision if he moves forward with it.\n\nI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo.\n\n\n\nIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\n* Ensures ISIS comeback.\n\n* Forces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran.\n\n* Destroys Turkey\u2019s relationship with U.S. Congress.\n\n* Will be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah echoed his fellow Republican\u2019s concern.\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) October 7, 2019\n\nSeveral other Republicans also spoke out about the sudden shift in U.S. foreign policy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urged the U.S. to \u201ckeep its word\u201d with its foreign allies during an appearance Monday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said in a statement.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called Trump\u2019s decision a \u201cgrave mistake.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move \u201cpositively sinister.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties.\n\n\n\nThen we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them.\n\n\n\nNow Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\n\nPositively sinister. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 7, 2019\n\nBrett McGurk, the former U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, blasted Trump for demonstrating \u201ca complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump made a similarly impulsive decision when I was managing the policy,\u201d tweeted McGurk, who resigned last year when Trump announced plans to abruptly withdraw American troops from Syria. \u201cTrump tonight after one call with a foreign leader provided a gift to Russia, Iran, and ISIS.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019", "description": "Sen.
