The Category 5 storm next threatens to bring hurricane force winds, coastal flooding and heavy rain to the east coast of Florida and Southeast U.S.\n\nDorian\u2019s winds had only eased modestly, down to 180 mph at 11 p.m. Sunday, still generating \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d in the northern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center stated the storm made landfall on Grand Bahama Island at 11 p.m. after slamming into Great Abaco earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cDorian remains an incredibly powerful hurricane,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote.\n\nAs the storm closes in on Florida\u2019s east coast, the National Hurricane Center has posted hurricane and storm surge warnings for some areas. The storm surge is the storm-driven rise in water above normally dry land at the coast:\n\nThe hurricane warning stretches from Jupiter Inlet (just north of West Palm Beach) to the Volusia/Brevard county line (just north of Titusville).\n\nThe storm surge warning spans from near West Palm Beach to Titusville. In some areas the surge could reach 4 to 7 feet, the Hurricane Center projects.\n\nThese warnings are focused on the period from Monday night through early Wednesday. Tropical storm-force winds could begin in south Florida as soon as Monday afternoon and continue into Tuesday and Wednesday, perhaps reaching hurricane-force Tuesday depending how close to the coast Dorian tracks.\n\nIn addition to the wind and surge, about to three to six inches of rain is projected along Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nAlthough the center of Dorian, containing its extreme Category 5 winds, may remain offshore Florida, its forecast track is so close to the coast that it necessitated warnings. \u201cA small deviation to the left of the track could bring the intense core of the hurricane its dangerous winds closer to or onto the Florida coast,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote.\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian on Sunday morning. (NOAA)\n\nBeyond Florida, Dorian will take aim at coastal Georgia and the Carolinas Wednesday through Friday. \u201cThere is an increasing likelihood of strong winds and dangerous storm surge along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina later this week,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote. \u201cResidents in these areas should continue to monitor the progress of Dorian and listen to advice given by local emergency officials.\u201d\n\nEffects on the Bahamas\n\nWhile Florida and areas farther north await effects from the monster storm, a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d scenario is unfolding in the northwestern Bahamas, where the storm\u2019s eyewall, the ring of destructive winds around the center, struck Sunday. On Great Abaco, which suffered a direct hit, the Hurricane Center warned of a \u201clife-threatening situation\u201d into Sunday evening.\n\n[\u2018Pray for us\u2019: Dorian snapping trees, tearing off roofs in the Bahamas]\n\nWatch #MarshHarbour go through the eye of #Dorian.

The storm\u2019s peak winds were 180 mph, and Dorian has maintained Category 4 and now Category 5 intensity for an unusually long period.\n\nStorms this powerful typically tend to undergo cycles that weaken their high-end winds for a time, but Dorian has somehow avoided this dynamic.\n\nThe threat to Florida and the Southeast\n\nAfter models run early Saturday shifted the storm track offshore Florida, some that were run late Saturday into Sunday shifted it back closer to the Florida coast.\n\nDorian has grown larger in size, which may have implications for the Florida forecast. Hurricane-force winds now extend outward up to 45 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km). The latest forecast from the Hurricane Center calls for Dorian to remain a Category 5 storm until Monday night before slowly weakening, but remaining a formidable hurricane, as it moves close to Florida and northward to the Carolinas.\n\nBecause the storm is predicted to be a slow mover, effects from wind, rain and storm surge could be prolonged, lingering through the middle of next week on Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\n[Incredible views of Category 5 Hurricane Dorian near peak intensity]\n\nIrrespective of the storm\u2019s ultimate course near Florida\u2019s east coast to the North Carolina Outer Banks \u2014 or even inland \u2014 significant coastal flooding is likely because of the force of Dorian\u2019s winds and astronomically high or king tides.\n\nThe risk of a direct strike on Florida is less than it was a few days ago but has not been eliminated. Much depends on the strength of the high-pressure area that has been pushing Dorian west toward the northern Bahamas and Florida. The high acts as a blocking mechanism to prevent the storm from turning north out to sea, at least until the high diminishes in strength.\n\nMost models show steering currents collapsing as Dorian nears Florida because of a weakening of the high, before it gets scooped up by a dip in the jet stream approaching the East Coast and starts turning north.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the northwest or north turn is very critical in determining how close Dorian will get to the Florida peninsula on Tuesday and Wednesday,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote.\n\nSome models don\u2019t turn the storm soon enough, continuing to track the storm close enough for damaging impacts in parts of the state. One trend in the models overnight on Saturday and Sunday afternoon has been to show a slightly stronger high that brings the center of Dorian farther west, closer to the Florida coast and the Southeast coast, before making the northward turn.\n\n\n\nGroup of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Sunday afternoon for Tropical Storm Dorian. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slightly altered input data.

The bold red line is the average of all of the European model simulations, while the bold blue one is the average of all the American model simulations. (StormVistaWxModels.com)\n\nIn a statement, the National Weather Service forecast office in Melbourne, Florida, said \u201cThe situation has become more serious, especially for the east central Florida coastal counties,\u201d based on recent forecast guidance.\n\n\n\nThreat of different hazards in Florida from Dorian. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe latest storm surge forecast for Florida shows that if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide, the area from the Volusia and Brevard County Line to Jupiter Inlet could see 4 to 7 feet of water above ground, while the region from Deerfield Beach to Jupiter Inlet experiences 2 to 4 feet.\n\nFarther north into coastal Georgia and the Carolinas, the forecast is also a nail-biter. Just small differences in where the storm starts to turn north and, eventually, northeast and the shape of the turn will determine where and whether Dorian makes landfall.\n\nScenarios involving a direct hit, a graze and a near miss appear equally likely based on available forecasts. As the Hurricane Center writes: \u201cResidents in these areas should continue to monitor the progress of Dorian.\u201d\n\nThe shape of the coastline from northern Florida through the Carolinas means there is a risk of significant storm-surge flooding there even if the storm\u2019s center remains just offshore.\n\nHowever, unlike with notorious recent storms such as Matthew and Florence, it\u2019s unlikely that the Carolinas will experience devastating rainfall amounts from Hurricane Dorian, as the storm will pick up forward speed on nearing the Carolinas.\n\n1 of 49 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as Hurricane Dorian hits the Bahamas and Floridians prepare for the storm View Photos Dorian closes in on the northern Bahamas, battering the islands with Category 5 winds, pounding waves and torrential rain.

The only other is Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The international hurricane database goes back continuously only to 1983.\n\nThe storm\u2019s peak sustained winds rank as the strongest so far north in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida on record. Its pressure, which bottomed out at 910 millibars, is significantly lower than Hurricane Andrew\u2019s when it made landfall in south Florida in 1992 (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm).\n\nFour straight years.\n\n\n\nFive category five hurricanes.\n\n\n\nFive incredible eyes. pic.twitter.com/LeD1nnbRZb \u2014 Dakota Smith (@weatherdak) September 1, 2019\n\nWith Dorian attaining Category 5 strength, this is the first time since the start of the satellite era (in the 1960s) that Category 5 storms have developed in the tropical Atlantic in four straight years, according to Capital Weather Gang\u2019s tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian reached Category 5 intensity unexpectedly on Sunday morning, just as it began bearing down on the northern Bahamas.
