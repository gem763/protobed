The fact is that it is outrageous,' Biden said.\n\n'Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\n\nGiuliani was referencing Trump's 2016 call for Russia to find Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, and his call for Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nBiden defended his son, on a day when Hunter Biden told ABC he would forego foreign work if his father wins the presidency, acknowledged some responsibility for the appearance of favoritism, and admitted he got jobs due to his father\u2019s name.\n\nRudy Giuliani is under scrutiny for his efforts to get Ukraine to probe the Bidens\n\nJoe Biden said he and son Hunter did 'nothing wrong'\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sandes helped change the subject to health care and impeachment after Biden defended himself\n\n'Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.'\n\n'And what I wanted to make a point about -- and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office,' Biden said.\n\nHe noted President George Washington warned of the danger of foreign interference in U.S. affairs.\n\n'On the \u2013 look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America.'\n\nPresident Trump left doubt as to whether Giuliani is still his lawyer last week amid fallout over Ukraine\n\nCo-moderator Anderson Cooper asked if Hunter showed 'poor judgement' serving on the board of energy firm Burisma, and if Biden made a mistake by 'letting him.'\n\n'Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.'\n\nBiden continued: 'My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.'\n\nBiden's defense came on a night when Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren endured many of the sharpest blows of the night \u2013 a reflection of her status as a front-runner.\n\nAfter he spoke, rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders jumped in to give a lift by urging the discussion move on to other subjects.\n\n'Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured,' said Sanders.\n\nWhen Sanders was done, a moderator then moved on to questions about the economy.\n\nHis comments came after Biden adviser Anita Dunn indicated to DailyMail.com that the campaign considered the subject of Hunter Biden to be closed. 'He answered all the questions,' she said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden branded Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates 'thugs' at Tuesday night's Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19790808-0-image-a-2_1571234711288.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
