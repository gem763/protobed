I shared them with my two sons. They have all been consumed. It is the best chilli belacan we have tasted. Can my family have a few more? Sorry to trouble you over this. It makes so many dishes taste better. Yours sincerely,\n\nLee Kuan Yew\n\n\n\n\n\nTunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah first posted a photo of the letter on her Instagram (@airtangan_tunkuazizah) back in May 2018; she reposted it again on Twitter (@cheminahsayang) on Friday (25 Oct).\n\nIn her half-cheeky Twitter post, Tunku Azizah wrote in Malay, \u201cI have wanted to share this with the people of Malaysia for a long time. I used to be the official sambal belacan supplier to the PM of Singapore, Dato Lee Kuan Yew... and now supply to his son, PM Lee, too!\u201d\n\nIn her older Instagram post, Azizah had said of Lee\u2019s letter, \u201cThis is such an important letter to me... All because of sambal belacan\u2026 I was deeply touched.\u201d\n\nLee Kuan Yew and his family, who are Peranakan, would be quintessentially Peranakan in their love for sambal belacan, which features heavily in their Malay-influenced cuisine.\n\nAzizah is queen to King Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, who is also the Sultan of the state of Pahang and was crowned as Malaysia\u2019s monarch in January this year. The Sultans of Malaysia rotate the position of king among themselves every five years.\n\nAzizah is also the sister of the current Johor Sultan, Ibrahim ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the sambal belacan made by the queen. Doesn\u2019t it look really sedap and spicy?\n\nSambal belacan made by Malaysian Queen Azizah, in a photo posted on her Instagram. More\n\nThe current Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s son, Lee Hsien Loong, is apparently also a big fan of Tunku Azizah\u2019s cooking. Azizah shared what appears to be another letter by the younger Lee, dated September 2018, in which he expresses delight at receiving her cookbooks as gifts and promised that he and his wife, Ho Ching, would try out her recipes at home. He also sent Azizah a cookbook containing Peranakan recipes by his grandmother, Lee Chin Koon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is perhaps one good way to cement friendly diplomatic relations: through the sharing of delicious food among the officials of neighbouring countries!", "description": "The late Lee Kuan Yew's family, including current Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, apparently loves Queen Azizah's cooking.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Editorial Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O0hSwImm40iGqcmLq2REUg--~B/aD03MDg7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c8d27680-f6f4-11e9-8eff-3df43c6abc8d", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
