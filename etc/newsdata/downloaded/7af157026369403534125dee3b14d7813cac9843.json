Scotland Yard vowed to take a tougher line after being accused of surrendering the streets to them for more than a week during demonstrations in April.\n\nBut despite the arrests, police failed to move them all and restore order. Those affected up by the protest included the Prime Minister, who spoke at Banqueting House on Whitehall during the launch of the third volume of an official biography of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nA banner is displayed saying 'This is Change' on Westminster Bridge as the sun sets on the first day of two weeks of protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters pitch tents in the road near Westminster Abbey after a day of protests that are due to continue for two weeks\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters dance in the street outside Westminster Abbey this evening as the protesters start to party\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester is surrounded by police at Trafalgar Square this evening.

One paramedic at the hospital on the south side of Westminster Bridge said the protests caused 'a lot of disruption' and delayed ambulance journeys by up to 15 minutes. The gridlock left one cancer patient stuck outside the hospital for more than an hour because a taxi couldn't get to her.\n\nVeronica Smith, 55, who has lung cancer, attended an appointment at midday to drain her lungs. The care worker from Lewisham, south London, was discharged at 1.45pm but was still stranded at 3pm.\n\nAnother patient, who gave his name as Tony, 66, criticised the activists as he hobbled on a broken foot through the protest to attend an appointment.\n\nHe said: 'My bus should have been stopping outside the hospital. They should be all arrested and water-cannoned. It is absolutely disgraceful. Why do they have to disrupt people's lives?' Meanwhile, delivery driver Shah Kamal, 22, from south London, said he had to abandon his vehicle for more than two hours after being caught up in blockades.\n\nHe fears he may not get paid after failing to complete his deliveries.\n\nHaving started work at 5am, he was still unable to drive over Lambeth Bridge almost 12 hours later. He said: 'I don't think I'm getting home tonight. It is just ridiculous.'\n\nPolice taking control on Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening and confiscating camping gear and cooking equipment\n\nPolice officers in Trafalgar Square use angle grinders and de-bonder to release to Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists who locked and glued themselves together\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists continue to block the road at Trafalgar Square holding a banner saying 'You're burning out future'\n\nClimate activists from Extinction Rebellion lock together to stop traffic on Whitehall in Westminster as police (bottom of frame) stand and film the scene.

They also shut down Smithfield meat market in east London. Mark Rylance gave a speech in which he revealed that his decision to resign from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship contract with BP was inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg. Addressing a crowd off The Mall, he said: 'The collapse of society is certain.'\n\nActress Juliet Stevenson said: 'All over the world, millions and millions of people's lives are already feeling the impact and livelihoods are being destroyed.' The protesters staged a wedding, did yoga and set up camps with tents during the demonstration to curb global warming.\n\nThey also played cricket outside the Supreme Court, while 'lady vicars' occupying the south side of Lambeth Bridge sang hymns.\n\nExtinction Rebellion claims the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which brought major disruption to London and saw more than 1,100 arrests.\n\nIt cost Scotland Yard \u00a316million to police the earlier demonstrations \u2013 enough to pay the salaries of 600 bobbies.\n\nYesterday, Downing Street said protesters who 'significantly disrupt the lives of others' should feel the 'full force of the law'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is essential that people can continue to go about their business. The right to peaceful protest does not extend to unlawful activity.\n\n'The Government expects police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others and to use the full force of the law.'\n\nThe driver of a hearse, who has attached himself to the steering wheel using a bicycle lock, is pictured as his vehicle is used to block the road at the junction of Whitehall and Trafalgar Square during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London today\n\nHowever, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell backed the activists, tweeting: 'Solidarity #ExtinctionRebellion.'\n\nResponding to a video of a protester resisting arrest, National Crime Agency chief Lynne Owens tweeted that Met Police officers 'should not have to endure this sort of behaviour'. She added: 'No cause can justify the assaulting of another human being.'\n\nThe protest is part of an 'international rebellion' taking place in cities including Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said in a statement: 'As dawn broke today, many thousands of people from around the world entered a new phase of rebellion against planetary inaction. Groups across 60 cities began blocking roads, bridges and transport links with the intention of remaining until our voices are heard.'\n\nAs evening descended on the capital, activists could still be seen on Westminster Bridge holding a large banner saying 'This is Change.'\n\nAnd close to Westminster Abbey more tents were pitched up as protesters could be seen playing music and dancing after the first day of protests drew to a close.\n\nIn response to claims the police have been outnumbered by protesters, a spokesman for the Met said: 'The Met has taken a robust stance in policing this protest with over 270 arrests made so far and the seizure of equipment that prevents sustained and unlawful protest and will continue to arrest.\n\n'We have a proportionate policing plan in place and relevant resources to deal with any incidents that may arise, however, whilst we have a significant number of officers policing the protests, we also have to ensure that enough officers remain on their boroughs to continue to carry out day-to-day policing and protect the wider community.'\n\nToday was the first day of a planned fortnight of disruption by Extinction Rebellion, bringing chaos to London as they shut down key routes in the city.\n\nProtesters were joined by eco-luvvies Daisy Lowe, Mark Rylance, Ruby Wax and Juliet Stevenson in Trafalgar Square as they shut down the landmark.\n\nFor the next two weeks XR - which has posted details and maps of its planned disruptions in advance - intends to cripple the capital with 276 protesters arrested already since the protests began at 7am today.\n\nOne senior member warned ahead of the protests that if police shut them down: 'We have other plans that are more disruptive'.\n\nCommuters vented their fury about long delays and miles of queues as they criticised the XR 'hypocrites' causing more pollution by forcing cars to sit idling, while others blasted the 'nuisances' who had ruined their journeys.\n\nToday streets around Westminster were packed with police threatening to arrest anyone blocking roads - but witnesses said they were being swamped because of the number of eco-zealots gathering on streets and bridges.\n\nAsked why officers did not block protesters from getting onto the bridge, the Met said: 'We do not have the power to stop every person crossing a bridge. Those who have been found to be breaking the law have been dealt with robustly.'\n\nOne group locked themselves inside a car parked in the middle of Whitehall close to Downing Street and the Cenotaph - others chained themselves by the arms and head to a hearse parked in Trafalgar Square and glued themselves to scaffolding poles.\n\nIt has become common for the detained protesters to be carried by police, because they try to cause maximum disruption by refusing to walk to the van - meaning it can take up to six officers for each arrest.\n\nActor Mark Rylance joined Extinction Rebellion protesters in The Mall today where supporters of the environmental group invaded during the Changing of the Guard\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists marking the 'opening ceremony' of their protest in Trafalgar Square were joined today by Ruby Wax, Juliet Stevenson and Daisy Lowe (left to right)\n\nSocial media users have complained that the protesters were taking up huge amounts of police resources in London today\n\nSocial media users have questioned why police are not more active (left) and questioned the huge amount of police resources being used\n\nPolice remove a protester from the Extinction Rebellion protest at Trafalgar Square in London this afternoon\n\nPolice carry away a protester by the arms and legs on Westminster Bridge, which was blocked by XR members including some doing yoga\n\nOn Millbank, outside the headquarters of MI5 in London, a group built a wooden house and climbed on top when the police attempted to pull it down\n\nPolice wearing abseiling safety equipment arrive to remove protesters from scaffolding in Trafalgar Square today\n\nXR supporters pitched tents outside Westminster Abbey as they promised two weeks of chaos and gridlock to save the planet\n\nExtinction Rebellion posted this graphic online before the protests began, showing where their intended targets would be\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion couple getting married at an action site that is being called 'The Beacon' on Westminster Bridge\n\nThe happy couple appear head-over-heels during their nuptials on Westminster Bridge today.

Others wearing XR badges and carrying XR flags were seen getting lunch in McDonald's on Whitehall.\n\nDaisy Lowe (second left) posed next to Big Ben with friends including actress Jaime Winstone (far right), popstar Eliza Caird, best known as Eliza Doolittle (centre right), and TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet (far left) today\n\nTV stars were at the environmental group's 'opening ceremony' under Nelson's Column as thousands closed major bridges, blocked numerous roads and even invaded The Mall during the Changing of the Guard where Rylance helped carry a giant banner saying: 'extinction or rebellion'.\n\nLowe posed next to Big Ben with friends including actress Jaime Winstone, popstar Eliza Caird, best known as Eliza Doolittle, and TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet who said: 'Life is already extinct. It's just a matter of saving what life we have left'.\n\nMinisters are understood to be looking at whether protesters who damage parts of London can be held financially responsible. In an Extinction Rebellion stunt last week, fake blood was sprayed over the Treasury \u2013 although much of it ended up going back over the demonstrators themselves.\n\nOne government source suggested a mechanism could be bringing a civil action to hurt demonstrators 'in their wallets'. 'There is discussion about whether we can ensure they are bearing the cost,' the source said. 'Democratic protests is one thing, but you cannot wreck listed buildings.'\n\nHowever, actress Juliet Stevenson called the protests 'wonderful', adding: 'We can't any longer allow governments to do this so we have to make it clear that there is no more time.\n\n'There's a long tradition in this country of people saying governments are not acting, we have to make them realise how urgent this is.'\n\nShe told MailOnline that said she had been swayed to join the protests as she wanted a future for the planet and her four children. She said she felt a duty to do what she could to help stop environmental damage and climate change.\n\nStevenson said: 'My children are saying they are not sure they want to have children when the planet is in such danger. I have a one-year-old grandchild too and I want to help ensure all of their futures.' We have 12 years before the planet is irreversibly damaged. The scientists have warned about it.'\n\nPolice surround a group of XR people chained together outside Westminster Abbey today as they stop anyone joining them\n\nPolice wearing abseiling safety equipment and armed with acetone arrive to remove protesters glued to scaffolding at the Extinction Rebellion opening ceremony\n\nA climate change activist looks unperturbed and relaxed as six police officers carry him away from Trafalgar Square\n\nMs Stevenson, 62, star of the film 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' praised the young activists who had decided to act and blamed herself and much of her own generation for not acting before.\n\nSmithfield Market, London's largest meat market, was 'occupied' by 500 people starting with a minute's silence for the dead animals there and around the world\n\n'I was in Parliament and saw a plaque in honour of the suffragettes. In 100 years time these young people will be heroes too for what they are doing today.'\n\nTory MP Mark Pritchard said: 'Climate change needs to be tackled, the government is committed to net zero emissions by 2050, a huge step forward.\n\n'But what are ambulances carrying critical patients supposed to do with roads blocked, bridges occupied & displaced gridlock all over central London?'\n\nAnd Former Labour MP Ian Austin said: 'Not content with preventing ordinary Londoners from getting to work on buses - including people on zero hours contracts who will lose pay - the Extinction Rebelion protesters are blocking the bike lane on Lambeth Bridge and standing in the one on Westminster Bridge.'\n\nActivists say the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which saw more than 1,100 arrests. They are part of an 'international rebellion', with action also taking place in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nPolice had arrested 148 protesters by 3pm today as key traffic routes through Westminster faced major congestion today with buses diverted and the demonstrations expected to escalate over the next fortnight.\n\nParliament Square was empty of traffic except for police vans and bicycles as helicopters circled overhead, while on Lambeth Bridge protesters started to build a house before climbing on top when police tried to dismantle it.\n\nPassionate vegan, 33, who walked out of the Big Brother house gets involved in vegan protest at Smithfield A passionate vegan who wants the lifestyle to become mainstream walked out of the Big Brother house last year was today involved in a protest at Smithfield Market. Kay Lovelle, 33, left the Channel 5 programme last October after repeatedly clashing with fellow housemates. She later admitted deciding to walk in the dead of night to avoid having to face the public. Speaking to Sky News at Smithfield Market today, Lovell, who is protesting with Animal Rebellion, said: 'We're here to demand a complete system change, so to actually transition into a plant based food system. Kay Lovelle, 33, spoke to Sky News today while she takes part in the Animal Rebellion protest at Smithfield Market this afternoon 'As we now know, animal agriculture accounts for a huge, huge amount. And it causes really devastating impact on the environment, causing the whole climate catastrophe. It's more than all of transport put together. 'We can no longer deny the impact our diet has on our planet. We cannot escape this climate catastrophe if we don't transition into a plant based food system. We are here to show our version of the future. 'So we're actually opening up a massive fruit and veg market. We've got a lot of incredible vegan meats and cheeses and plant-based vendors here. We're not here to take anyone's jobs, we're not here to do anything like that. This is really very peaceful, non-violent.' Kay Lovelle, 33, left the Channel 5 reality show Big Brother last October after repeatedly clashing with fellow housemates Lovelle, an actress who has had roles in the likes of The Bill, Judge John Deed and Inspector Lewis, was born in Georgia and lived in Russia before moving to London as a child. Speaking in the diary room before her exit from Big Brother last year, she said: 'I just really feel that I'm going to be eaten alive. I don't want to put myself through that because I will just be running for the fire exits. I just feel so trapped.'\n\nThe demonstrators, who are also planning processions, marches and a sit-in at City Airport, claim they are ready to face arrest, go to jail and go on hunger strike as they urge politicians to outline plans to tackle climate change.\n\nThe arrests today are in addition to those over the weekend, with eight people arrested on Saturday - seven on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance, and the eighth on suspicion of obstructing police. All those arrested on Saturday have been released under investigation.\n\nAnd yesterday one woman and two men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. The woman has been released under investigation, the men remain in custody, the police said.\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson is due to give a speech on Westminster Bridge at 6pm. But a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'People are entitled to protest peacefully but they must do so within the law. It's essential that people can go about their business going to work, visiting families and using vital public services.'\n\nIn response to a video of a protester resisting arrest, National Crime Agency chief Lynne Owens tweeted: 'Thinking of all my colleagues at Metropolitan Police.

Others stacked a pile of items including a kitchen sink, pans, and camp chairs beside them on the pavement.\n\nThis morning, activists gathered for their first protest on Victoria Embankment where they unfurled a banner on a human roadblock saying 'XR Peace \u2013 For Earth, For All Of Us' and held a placard saying: 'Tell the Truth'.\n\nXR protesters playing steel drums marched from Parliament Square to Trafalgar Square, and a 25-year-old teacher from London who took the week off to join the protests said: 'The plan is to shut down the whole of London.\n\nProtestors performing yoga on Westminster Bridge during an Extinction Rebellion protest in the capital today\n\nPolice officers lead a man away in handcuffs as the Extinction Rebellion protests outside Westminster Tube station today\n\nA protester wearing a gas mask on top of vehicles blocking the road in Trafalgar Square during the protest in London today\n\nPolice officers talk to protesters from Extinction Rebellion as they block the road in Westminster this morning\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester sits in a police van after being removed by police from the Embankment this morning\n\nA man wears an anti-Trump T-shirt as a hearse is used to block the road at the junction of Whitehall and Trafalgar Square today\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists blockade Trafalgar Square with a scaffolding tower during the protest in London today\n\nActivists carry out yoga at Westminster Bridge during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London this morning\n\nPeople distribute free food at Westminster Bridge during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London today\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters play cricket in Parliament Square in London today during the demonstration\n\n'The issue of climate change is an issue for everyone, and it's clear we can't leave it to the politicians.

I am still keen to do this but once I came across XR I was so relieved to have something I could do about the ghastly state we have got our planet in.'\n\nShe added: 'The whole thing is so urgent that it is imperative the Government should take serious actions and put pressure on other states and Global Powers to radically reduce the use of fossil fuels even if this means we need to reduce our comfort at home and so much flying.'\n\nProtesters were carried away by police officers on Horse Guards Road. An onlooker said he saw at least five people arrested after they refused to let a van through the road.\n\nVideo of the moment showed people being carried off to chants of 'we love you' from other protesters.

This. Stuff. Up. If. You. Tried.' Extinction Rebellion protesters were spotted ordering food at a McDonald's restaurant in Westminster today today The protesters in the tweet, which received more than 3,500 likes, were mocked online - with one Twitter user saying: 'Priceless. Mummy didn't have any mung beans in to make Jocasta and Tarquin their packed lunch.' Another said: 'We must stop capitalism and cease all modern farming and industry practices! Right after I get my mass produced McNuggets...' Other demonstrators were seen gathering outside a Pret A Manger on Great Peter Street in Westminster, with some spotted drinking from disposable coffee cups.\n\nTwo protesters have mounted a Land Rover and trailer at Trafalgar Square roundabout, one wearing a gas mask and trench coat and the other with an XR flag and a sign reading 'stop ecoside'. Police surrounded the vehicle.\n\nPolice officers were photographed carrying away protesters, with one was cut out from a rig carrying a fake nuclear weapon saying 'Trident - Immoral, obsolete, militarily useless' near the Ministry of Defence.\n\nOne tearful activist called Rowan compared the protesters to Gandhi and Martin Luther King, telling LBC radio: 'I'm feeling quite moved at the moment because I've just been watching people being taken away.\n\n'It's very moving seeing people giving their freedom and giving so much of their lives. Some of these people have been doing this for years, trying to raise the warning about climate change.\n\n'I really feel that this is their last chance to try to turn things around. If we don't turn it around this time, that's it. That's it for the people in the future.\n\n'I feel the legacy we've inherited from the people who have done non-violence civil disobedience in the past - people like Martin Luther King and Gandhi. They all fought for freedom and human rights and for the right for life on earth. They've handed the torch on to us.'\n\nPolice moved into remove the fake missile as protesters shouted 'Tell the Truth', and several chained themselves into a car along the Embankment before officers used cutting gear to remove the chains and arrest them.\n\nMany of the protesters risked being arrested on suspicion of obstruction of the highway.
