I walk a bit like a farmer, one of the directors said.\"\n\nOn mimicking the Queen's accent, Colman said: \"I thought that general 'posh' would do it, but apparently not.\n\n\"Really unusual vowel sounds. If you're saying 'yes', you say 'ears'. It's fun to do, isn't it? Very hard to stop. Ears.\"\n\nColman is taking over as the Queen from Claire Foy, who took the role in the first two seasons.", "description": "Olivia Colman has told of her struggles in having to adapt her walk, accent and even the way she sits to play the Queen in The Crown.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Victoria Coren Mitchell", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000206012106-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9WVLDaeaWzlxIQpTU2T6YjQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
