REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\nCarney said the deal, which still faces a key vote in Britain\u2019s parliament on Saturday, was \u201cgood news\u201d because it means Britain could avoid what the BoE has warned would be a major economic shock: dropping out of the EU with no transition.\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, more than three years after voters shocked investors and employers by opting to take the country out of the world\u2019s biggest trading area.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Carney said clarity on Brexit would help to revive business investment that has fallen sharply since the 2016 referendum.\n\nIn a separate interview with the BBC, Carney said Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal might not help the economy to the same extent as his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s plan, which proposed closer ties with the EU but was rejected by parliament.\n\nAsked if securing a Brexit transition meant the BoE would resume raising rates, Carney said: \u201cNot necessarily. I\u2019m not going to pre-commit, there is a lot of contingencies there.\u201d\n\nHe said the IMF had stressed the precarious nature of the world economy, which has prompted other central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus.\n\n\u201cWe have to take that into account. How much momentum is there in the global economy?\u201d Carney said.\n\nHis comments echoed a statement by the BoE after its policy meeting in September when it said it expected to raise rates gradually, as long as a no-deal Brexit shock to the economy was avoided and global growth picked up.\n\nLater on Friday, Carney said that in 16 years of attending meetings at the IMF he had never seen the level of concern among global finance chiefs about barriers to trade.\n\nAsked to sum up the mood at the gathering, Carney described it as \u201cthe almost existential uncertainty about the structure of the trading system.\u201d\n\nThe IMF this week warned that the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the financial crisis, and things could get a lot worse if the trade tensions remain unresolved.", "description": "Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain's planned Brexit deal would help the country's economy, but \"almost existential\" worries about global trade wars might prevent the BoE from raising interest rates.", "authors": ["William Schomberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442591109&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1RM", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
