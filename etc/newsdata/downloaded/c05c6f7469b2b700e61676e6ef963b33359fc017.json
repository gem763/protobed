[Photo provided for chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nTo mark the World Thrombosis Day, which falls on October 13 each year, ten top public hospitals throughout China have launched awareness-raising events like such as health education lectures and free consultations over the weekend to well inform the patients and the general public of the fatal disease which often got overlooked.\n\nAt the events sponsored by Cardinal Health Group, patients and the public can learn more about the medical condition of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from clinical experts from ten Chinese hospitals such as the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Shandong Provincial Hospital, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, VTE refers to a blood clot that starts in a vein. It is the one of the leading vascular diagnosis after heart attack and stroke worldwide.\n\nWith an ageing population, thromboembolic diseases have become a major global health challenge and the top three cardiovascular causes of death are related to thrombosis including VTE, which is a very important category but with low public awareness.\n\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the two clinical manifestations of VTE in different parts and stages. There are three reasons for it: venous damage, hypercoagulable state and venous blood flow stasis.\n\nThis \"invisible killer\" seems to be dangerous and tricky, but it is actually preventable and controllable, experts said.\n\nA lack of exercise is a major cause of VTE. Previous studies found that for every hour of sitting still, the risk of developing DVT increases by 10%, and sitting for more than 90 minutes reduces blood circulation of knee joints by 50%.\n\nIt is recommended that people who have to sit for long stand up regularly to move their legs. People at high-risk of DVT, including hospitalized patients, surgical patients and pregnant women, need to pay special attention.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a balanced diet, more water and smoking cessation are important as well. In addition to a healthy lifestyle, wearing graduated compression stockings (GCS) correctly is also an internationally recognized and effective physical prevention method.\n\nIn the global VTE prevention & control, the United States and the United Kingdom have established national VTE prevention & control centers. In China, VTE prevention lags far behind and the proportion of Chinese people receiving appropriate prevention stands at only 3.1%. Worse, there is no systematic standard in Chinese hospitals. In response, China is actively promoting the VTE prevention & control capabilities by establishing a number of VTE-related guidelines and standards. Authorities are building a complete national in-hospital VTE prevention & control system as required by the health authorities.", "description": "To mark the World Thrombosis Day, which falls on October 13 each year, ten top public hospitals throughout China have launched awareness-raising events like such as health education lectures and free consultations over the weekend to well inform the patients and the general public of the fatal disease which often got overlooked.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/15/5da58fc3a310cf3e97a158a5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
