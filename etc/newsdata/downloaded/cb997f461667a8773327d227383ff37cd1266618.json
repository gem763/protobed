(AP) - Jorge Soler broke the Kansas City home run record with his 39th homer of the season and Ryan O\u2019Hearn hit a game-ending home run to lift the Royals to a 6-5 win over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night.\n\nO\u2019Hearn sent the first pitch he saw from Zac Reininger in the ninth inning over the fence in right field after a seesaw final three innings.\n\nTigers\u2019 starter Daniel Norris grooved Soler a 2-2 fastball in the third inning and the Royals\u2019 slugger didn\u2019t miss. The three-run shot broke a tie with Mike Moustakas, who set the previous record with 38 home runs in 2017. The home run also gave Soler 100 RBIs on the season, becoming the first Royal to cross the century mark since Eric Hosmer in 2016.\n\nMike Montgomery was solid once again, allowing one run on six hits in 5 2/3 innings. Montgomery has now allowed one earned run or fewer in four of his last five starts and has a 2.10 ERA and 30 strikeouts in 30 innings over that span.\n\nWhit Merrifield had three hits, upping his season total to 176, just one back of Boston\u2019s Rafael Devers for the MLB lead.\n\nThe Tigers scored four runs from the seventh inning on to twice rally from deficits. Brandon Dixon put Detroit up 4-3 in the eighth inning with a sacrifice fly to score Jeimer Candelario, then tied the game in the ninth on Ronny Rodriguez\u2019s single, but Alex Gordon threw out Willi Castro at home to end the inning.\n\nGordon tied the game in the bottom of the eighth, legging out an infield single and Soler put the Royals up 5-4, racing home on a wild pitch.\n\nIan Kennedy (2-2) blew his fourth save of the season, but got the win thanks to O\u2019Hearn.\n\nSoler\u2019s home run was the only blemish on Norris, who threw just three innings because of pitching limits set by Detroit pitching coach Rick Anderson. Norris has thrown exactly three innings in five consecutive starts now.\n\nPlaying in his first major league game since June 13, Grayson Greiner was at the center of the Tigers\u2019 offense from the No. 9 hole in the lineup. He laced an RBI single in the third inning to put Detroit up 1-0, then scored on Victor Reyes\u2019 RBI double in the seventh inning to bring Detroit with in one, 3-2.\n\nGreiner finished with three hits and Reyes had a career-high had four hits, including two doubles, for his fifth straight multi-hit game. Reyes is hitting .591 (13 for 22) in those games.\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nBoth teams recalled a number of players prior to Tuesday\u2019s game. The Royals brought up 1B Ryan McBroom, who was acquired Saturday from the New York Yankees, INF/OF Erick Mejia and LHP Gabe Speier. Kansas City also activated RHP Jesse Hahn from the 60-day injured list, who had Tommy John surgery in August 2018. He hasn\u2019t pitched in the major leagues since 2017.\n\nThe Tigers recalled LHP Tyler Alexander, INF Jeimer Candelario, C Grayson Greiner, RHP Zac Reininger, OF Christian Stewart and LHP Daniel Stumpf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get some reinforcements up, especially some pitching,\u201d Gardenhire said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to help us out and give us a little better chance of getting the right people in there. It\u2019s fun for them. They\u2019re excited to be back here. We\u2019ve got a full clubhouse.\u201d\n\nBIG LEAGUE DEBUTS\n\nMcBroom made his major league debut Tuesday, getting the start at first base. McBroom was one of the most dangerous hitters in the International League this season, hitting .315 with 26 home runs in 117 games for Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre and led the league with 87 runs scored and a .976 OPS\n\nThe 27-year-old McBroom singled to right-center in his first plate appearance and finished the game 1 for 3.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals: RHP Jakob Junis (8-12) will make his fourth start of the season against Detroit on Wednesday. Junis has found plenty of success in his career against the Tigers with a 7-1 record, 3.18 ERA and 59 strikeouts in 11 appearances, 10 starts, his most wins and strikeouts against any team.\n\nTigers: Edwin Jackson (3-8) will start for Detroit, looking to snap a 3-game losing streak. Jackson lasted just 2 1/3 innings in his last outing Friday against Minnesota, when he allowed eight runs on seven hits and walked three.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jorge Soler broke the Kansas City home run record with his 39th homer of the season and Ryan O'Hearn hit a game-ending home run to lift the Royals to a 6-5 win over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kollin Miller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/aptopix_tigers_royals_baseball_09862_c0-987-2951-2707_s1770x1032.jpg?83443ff6178d0f27710fd21053ec524e47be4363"}
