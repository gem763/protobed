(Maayan Harel)\n\nNo one has locked eyes with a Denisovan for tens of thousands of years. These mysterious humans left behind few bones, unlike their close Neanderthal relatives, on their way to extinction. All the remains confirmed to be Denisovan \u2014 part of a pinkie finger, half a jawbone, some teeth \u2014 could rest comfortably in a shoe box.\n\nDespite their dearth of physical remains, the Denisovans left an indelible mark on our own species\u2019 evolution. Denisovans split from our ancestors some 700,000 years ago, but when modern humans and Denisovans encountered each other hundreds of thousands of years later, they mated; Denisovan DNA exists in human populations today. Some of their genes, recent research indicates, can give modern humans an immune system boost.\n\nNow team of scientists in Israel and Spain, without a skeleton to work from, are attempting to re-create Denisovan anatomy from DNA. The scientists, led by geneticists David Gokhman and Liran Carmel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, have estimated what the extinct humans\u2019 physical attributes should be, based on how their ancient genes might have functioned. The result, as they report in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, is an approximate Denisovan skeleton, which boasted a large rib cage, low forehead and wide pelvis.\n\nThe reconstructed Denisovan skull is broader than a modern human\u2019s, as though stretched gently apart at the cheekbones. Science illustrator Maayan Harel, working with the scientists to interpret the study, used the skeletal approximation to sculpt a female Denisovan head.\n\nHarel also painted a face. The illustration required some artistic freedom to produce \u201ca face with the skin and eyes and this special gaze,\u201d Carmel said. But it is \u201cas accurate as we as we possibly could do,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAn artist's portrait of the reconstruction of a juvenile female Denisovan. (Maayan Harel)\n\nOther research teams previously recovered DNA sequences from Denisovan and Neanderthal bones. Carmel and his colleagues looked for what\u2019s called DNA methylation within those sequences.\n\nDNA strands are built out of four basic building blocks, labeled A, C, G and T. The C type of DNA base can be tweaked with the addition of a methyl residue, which sticks to DNA like a parking boot on a wheel. Methylation alters a gene\u2019s activity, often by turning it off.\n\nGene activity, not a raw DNA sequence, makes an organism what it is. \u201cYou can think about the frog and the tadpole: It\u2019s the same DNA, it\u2019s identical DNA, and yet they are two completely different creatures. One has gills. The other has lungs. One has legs. The other has a tail, and so on,\u201d Carmel said. \u201cAnd all these differences are not because of differences in the DNA sequence, but these are differences in gene activity patterns.\u201d\n\nThe methyl molecule remains attached to DNA long after an animal has died, giving Carmel\u2019s team a proxy for gene activity that took place 100,000 years ago. They studied methylation patterns in three human groups: from a single Denisovan, two Neanderthals and dozens of Homo sapiens, including five who lived thousands of years ago. The researchers also compared these methylation maps to chimpanzees'.\n\nThey used DNA methylation patterns to predict how a skeletal attribute diverged from ours \u2014 whether a relative\u2019s bone was wider, narrower, bigger or smaller than the bone in a human body. \u201cThere is a lot of information in DNA methylation,\u201d Carmel said.\n\nThis method predicted known chimp and Neanderthal skeletal features with about 85 percent accuracy, Carmel said. Carmel and his colleagues identified 56 Denisovan traits that were well outside the range of modern humans or Neanderthals. Thirty-four of those traits describe anatomical features in the skull.\n\n\u201cSome of the traits match the preserved morphology,\u201d meaning the predictions square with the Denisovan bones, said Shara Bailey, an anthropologist at New York University who was unaffiliated with this research. But \u201cothers don\u2019t, which is to be expected given the 15 percent error rate, and the fact that the Denisovan DNA comes from a single individual.\u201d\n\nResearch like this could help identify more Denisovan samples. Ancient skull parts found in eastern China, which scientists have struggled to assign to a species, could belong to the Denisovans, Carmel said. It\u2019s not proof, but the skulls\u2019 shapes match the predicted Denisovan anatomy. Bailey agreed these skulls possibly were Denisovan.\n\nIn May, while Carmel\u2019s anatomical study was in review, Bailey and her colleagues published a report describing half of a lower Densiovan jawbone. \u201cWe were just, you know, in a frenzy to try to see how it matches our predictions,\u201d Carmel said. \u201cIt matches very nicely.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin anthropologist John Hawks, who was not involved with this research, endorsed this group\u2019s investigation of ancient DNA methylation and called them pioneers of the technique. \u201cIt\u2019s a line of investigation that I want to see people pursue,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he was \u201cnot yet willing to accept they can predict what the Denisovans looked like,\u201d Hawks said. No formula exists to describe the shape of modern human bones or bodies from genes, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cThere is a real potential for deciding the methylation was right, no matter what the bones looked like,\u201d Hawks said. If the methylation pattern suggested Neanderthals grew big pelvises \u2014 which the study does \u2014 the large flare in their upper hips could allow you to conclude the pattern is correct. But, conversely, if the methylation data suggested Neanderthals grew small pelvises, you could consider their lower pelvic bones, which are skinnier than humans\u2019 bones are. Then you might also agree with the genetic data. Either way, Hawks said, \u201cYou\u2019ve confirmed your own hypothesis, and not really tested it.\u201d\n\nCarmel said the predictions are accurate but cannot give precise measurements. \u201cWe can say, for example, they have longer fingers. But we cannot say they had one-millimeter-longer fingers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just say to which direction they are different from us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMom was a Neanderthal.
