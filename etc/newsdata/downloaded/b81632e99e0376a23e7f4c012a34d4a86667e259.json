Yet the forecasts persist at a consistent clip.\n\nBut Robert Shiller, the Nobel laureate and famed Yale economist, thinks investors are severely limited in their recessionary forecasts. And he believes a thorough examination of market narratives is the key to improving their odds of success.\n\n\"The probability that a recession will come soon \u2014 or be severe when it does \u2014 depends in part on the state of ever-changing popular narratives about the economy,\" he said in a recent New York Times column.\n\nHe added: \"These are stories that provide a framework for piecing together the seemingly random bits of information that one picks up from friends, the news or social media.\"\n\nShiller's argument stems from people's natural instinct to attach explanations and reasoning for every last event that occurs. Those prevailing narratives then, in turn, provide the foundation for forecasts and expectations.\n\nHe says we're ultimately influenced by the information we're exposed to. We hear something, and we repeat it. Then it builds and spreads at a rapid pace. Shiller thinks identifying how these psychological elements fit together is key in understanding how booms or busts manifest.\n\n\"For consumers, these narratives affect decisions on whether to spend or save, whether to take a demanding or an easy job, whether to take a risk or stick with something safer,\" Shiller said.\n\nHe added: \"For businesspeople, the prevailing narratives affect deliberations on whether to hire more help or lay off employees, whether to expand or retrench or even start a new enterprise.\"\n\nIn other words, Shiller is attributing economic activity \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 to shifts in sentiment and stories. He also places major emphasis on how profound and contagious these ideas are. In his mind, looking at the economic milieu from this lens provides better insight than hard data, as people's feelings change much faster than underlying fundamentals.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan's investment-strategy chairman lays out 3 reasons why the US will avoid recession through 2020\n\nIn his new book, \"Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events,\" Shiller provides examples of how prevailing narratives can suddenly turn into epidemics, exacerbating the direction, size, and severity of market moves.\n\nHe provides a few examples:\n\npublic confidence or the lack of it\n\nsocial norms regarding extravagance or modesty in consumption\n\nreal-estate booms and busts\n\nstock-market bubbles.\n\nIf these narratives sound familiar, it's because you can tie them to just about any past economic boom or bust. Their influence \u2014 although difficult to quantify \u2014 determines how much velocity ends up being behind a market move.\n\nIn today's environment, an inverted yield curve and a raging trade war have influential financial personalities and institutions sounding the alarm on a possible recession. Shiller says these negative thoughts tend to feed on each other, turning an idea into a reality that affects economic decision-making.\n\nIt becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2014 a story that turns into a real-life epidemic.\n\nGreat Depression parallels\n\nTo further his point, Shiller references major historical events like the Great Depression.\n\n\"The number of articles in the ProQuest News & Newspapers database containing the words 'Great Depression' rose fivefold from 2007 to 2008,\" he said.\n\nHis point is that at the height of emotional vulnerability \u2014 and in the absence of a material explanation \u2014 people's familiarity with the story of the Great Depression made for an easy comparison.\n\nAnd, regardless of merit, Shiller says it's still going on.\n\n\"The Great Depression narrative is still alive, though it does not dominate at the moment,\" he said in the column. \"President Trump's exuberant speeches, if one believes them, still encourage big spending and confidence. Yet older, troubling narratives are waiting to become viral again.\"\n\nShiller added: \"New crises that shake up the economy often surprise economists because no exogenous cause appears to be a sufficient explanation for a downturn. People begin to suddenly frame current events in the context of stories they had heard many times before.\"", "description": "The Nobel laureate Robert Shiller explained how market anxiety over a US recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/540afcea6bb3f7051dd9be76-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
