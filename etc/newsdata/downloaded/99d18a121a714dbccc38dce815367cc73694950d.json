Inventories reached 44.46 million animals in September, up 0.6% on a month earlier, while sow herds climbed 3.7% to 6.10 million head.\n\nMajor producing provinces including Henan, Shandong, and Liaoning also saw a considerable pick-up in pig inventories in September from the previous month, he said.\n\nAnd production and sales of pig feed have rebounded strongly, with output of hog feed up 10% in September from the previous month.\n\nTIGHT TIMETABLE\n\nAnalysts, however, said a forecast for a return to normal herd levels in 2020 was optimistic, with stopping the spread of the disease key to a recovery and no cure or vaccine yet available.\n\nPig production is recovering in the north, but is still falling in the south and southwestern regions, said an analyst with a Chinese consultancy, who declined to be named because of sensitivity around the issue.\n\n\u201cIf the disease can stabilize and doesn\u2019t reoccur, stocks might start to recover,\u201d she said, but even then would not reach normal levels until at least the second half of 2020.\n\nAnd while large farmers - including corporate pig producers such as C.P. Pokphand Co (0043.HK) and New Hope Liuhe (000876.SZ) - have been expanding rapidly, eyeing large profits from soaring pork prices, small farmers have traditionally made up the bulk of pork production.\n\nThe country\u2019s hog inventory stood at 428 million animals at the end of 2018, according to official data.\n\nIt also takes about 18 months to build, stock and produce pigs at a new farm, said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank, who said the ministry\u2019s goal was unrealistic.\n\n\u201cIn the first half of next year I think the herd will continue to drop,\u201d she said.\n\nSome companies have restocked farms that were infected with the disease only to see it reoccur, she said, while many small farmers have neither the capital or the will to boost their herds.", "description": "China's hog production capacity should bottom out this year after outbreaks of African swine fever decimated the world's biggest pig herd, an official said on Thursday, forecasting a return to usual pig numbers in 2020.", "authors": ["Hallie Gu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
