You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy year for Signature, which opened its Haggerston taproom last autumn and is in the middle of trebling its size with a new brewery, while We Serve Humans has taken over menus at two Leytonstone pubs just down the road for its latest residency.\n\nWalthamstow too is enjoying a moment at the epicentre of this year\u2019s London Borough of Culture, Waltham Forest.\n\nThe area near the Tube station has seen considerable regeneration as more Londoners move out to E17, and is peppered with chains \u2013 in among a few local institutions, more on which later \u2013 so for a casual bite, The Collab makes a great homegrown alternative to the Nandos and Turtle Bays.\n\nThe sizeable premises is busy when we arrive on a Friday evening, with a delicious smoky haze from the grill hanging in the air.\n\nIt\u2019s spacious with stripped-back decor: as \u201cpart taproom, part restaurant\u201d, it\u2019s the taproom vibe you pick up on first, but a variety of seating means it\u2019s equally suitable for families, solo diners and groups of lads, all of which are present.\n\nAlongside Signature\u2019s headline beers on tap, there\u2019s an impressive guest roster and a wide choice of cans and bottles. Roadie IPA and Studio Pilsner make refreshing first pints; later, to my dismay, the brewery\u2019s Festival Saison isn\u2019t available, but the bartender finds me a lovely alternative from Brew By Numbers.\n\nSo, to the burgers \u2013 besides wood-fired pizza, of course, the dominant food offering when it comes to craft beer joints \u2013 \u2019Humans is holding the menu down here with six meat options and four meat-free; something of a revelation for this vegetarian.\n\nMy companion opts for The Chairman, the house\u2019s classic beef burger, which is simple but effective; cooked to medium-rare with cheese and red onion jam. Extra points are awarded for a bun that successfully contains the components within.\n\nTempted as I am to go for the plant-based version (I\u2019m a big fan of the B12 patty) I decide to set myself up for a heart attack and pick the truffle mac and cheese burger. If it\u2019s comfort and/or carbs you want, look no further than this rich and tasty patty, held together by a crispy crumb.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to accompany the main event. As well as four varieties of fries, highlights from the sides include a house kimchi with just the right level of funk and, for more crunch, nicely charred baby gem lettuce with dijon vinaigrette and parmesan.\n\nMy companion found the Stoner BBQ wings a little overpowered by the pineapple in the sauce, and conceded Buffalo might have been a better choice.\n\nBy the time we head out the door there\u2019s a DJ playing and the lights are low; on top of an existing lunch deal and The Collab\u2019s newly launched weekend brunch menus, it\u2019s looking to become something of a destination venue in Walthamstow.\n\nIn this neck of the woods I\u2019d usually move on to the excellent Wild Card brewery, but it\u2019s a bit of a walk, and it\u2019s raining, so we head a couple of paces down the street to The Victoria, which is packed to the rafters, despite seeming like a relic from a bygone era. Just be sure to come when the karaoke\u2019s on.\n\nThe Collab, 198 Hoe St, Walthamstow, London E17 4BF; 020 8521 2948; open daily; thecollablondon.com", "description": "The idea that two heads are better than one is what underpins\u00a0The\u00a0Collab\u00a0in\u00a0Walthamstow, opened in March as a joint venture between northeast London-based Signature Brew and burger outfit\u00a0We Serve Humans.", "authors": ["Jo Turner"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/09/the-collab-walthamstow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
