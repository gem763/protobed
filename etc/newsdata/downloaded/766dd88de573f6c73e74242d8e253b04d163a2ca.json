In the study, one glass was equivalent to about 250 ml - less than a standard 330ml can sold in the UK.\n\nLead author Dr Neil Murphy said the findings were \u201cstriking\u201d and the third large study this year to find a link between diet drinks and raised mortality rates.\n\n\u201cIt would probably be prudent to limit consumption of all soft drinks and replace with a healthier alternative, such as water,\u201d he said.\n\nGavin Partington, director general at British Soft Drinks Association, said: \u201cSoft drinks are safe to consume as part of a balanced diet.\n\n\u201cAccording to all leading health authorities in the world, as well as Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK, low- and no-calorie sweeteners are safe.\u201d", "description": "Consuming two diet drinks a day could increase the risk of early death by more than a quarter, the World Health Organisation has warned.
