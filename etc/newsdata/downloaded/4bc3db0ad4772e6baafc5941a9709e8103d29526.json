REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File Photo\n\nThe impasse could exacerbate what Mahathir described as a trade war between the world\u2019s second biggest producer and exporter of the commodity and its biggest buyer so far this year.\n\nIndia\u2019s top vegetable oil trade body on Monday asked its members to stop buying Malaysian palm oil after Mahathir said at the U.N. General Assembly last month that India had \u201cinvaded and occupied\u201d Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government removed the long-standing autonomy of India\u2019s portion of the Kashmir valley on Aug. 5, calling it an internal matter and criticising countries that have spoken out against the move.\n\n\u201cWe speak our minds, and we don\u2019t retract or change,\u201d Mahathir told reporters outside parliament. \u201cWhat we are saying is we should all abide by resolutions of the (United Nations). Otherwise, what is the use of the U.N.?\u201d\n\nThe U.N. Security Council adopted several resolutions here in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the future of the region.\n\nMahathir said Malaysia would study the impact of the boycott called by the Mumbai-based Solvent Extractors\u2019 Association of India and look at ways to address the issue.\n\nNew Delhi has so far refused to comment on the trade spat.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Indian government, so we have to find out how we can communicate with these people, because trade is a two-way thing and it is bad to have what amounts to a trade war,\u201d Mahathir said.\n\nIn a separate statement, Malaysia\u2019s Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said the country viewed the call for a boycott with \u201cgreat concern.\u201d\n\nThe underlying sentiment tied to the association\u2019s decision was understood, but it was seen as a major setback in cooperation and working relations between the two countries, she said.\n\n\u201cI urge (the Solvent Extractors\u2019 Association of India) to not take such decisions unilaterally and allow both governments to resolve the current situation,\u201d Kok said.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s exports to India were worth $10.8 billion in the fiscal year through March 31, while imports totalled $6.4 billion, according to Indian government data.\n\nMalaysian palm oil futures slipped on Tuesday over concerns demand would fall from India.\n\nIndia was Malaysia\u2019s third-largest export destination in 2018 for palm oil and palm-based products worth 6.84 billion ringgit ($1.63 billion).\n\nMalaysia said last week it was considering raising imports of raw sugar and buffalo meat from India, in a bid to ease the trade tensions.\n\nIndia, the world\u2019s biggest importer of edible oils, also buys palm oil from Indonesia, soyoil from Argentina and Brazil, and sunflower oil from Ukraine.", "description": "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday he would not retract his criticism of New Delhi's actions in the disputed region of Kashmir even though Indian traders have urged a boycott of Malaysian palm oil.", "authors": ["Joseph Sipalan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443605648&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L08L", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
