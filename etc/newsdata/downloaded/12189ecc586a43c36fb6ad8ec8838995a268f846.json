In May, the top two floors of the 180-room, 14-storey hotel were renovated to create a handful of larger, five-star experience suites, and Room 1402 (priced from $520 a night) is the pick of them. It\u2019s spacious, filled with light, and supremely comfortable.\n\nWith travellers encouraged to take fewer flights and car journeys, trains are the ideal transport solution.\n\nThe suite comes into its own at dusk, with spectacular neon-lit views of Melbourne\u2019s iconic railway station. As the wage slaves trundle home, you can put your feet up with a cuppa after a day of meetings, and enjoy the high energy of this beautiful station. Completed in 1909, it\u2019s built in the art nouveau style with a striking dome and arched main entrance. It boasts the longest platform in Australia at 708 metres (and, by way of trivia, the fourth-longest in the world).\n\nWith travellers encouraged to take fewer flights and car journeys, trains are the ideal transport solution. Some of Britain\u2019s famous hotels are located directly above railway stations and it\u2019s a tradition that needs to be exhumed the world over, especially with the traffic snarls and costs involved in getting to the centre of capital cities from airports on the outskirts.\n\nJunior Suites at the Sofitel Brisbane Central comes with access to Club Millesime Lounge.\n\nSticking with the railway theme when bound for Brisbane a few months later, I opt to stay close to a main train station, settling on Sofitel Brisbane Central. Sure, the city has had a lot of beautiful new product come online over the past few years \u2013 including The Calile Hotel, the Ovolo in Fortitude Valley and the Emporium Hotel South Bank \u2013 but the ease of a CBD stay is hard to beat when on business.\n\nLocated on Turbot Street, Sofitel Brisbane Central is just steps away from both Central and Roma Street train stations, providing an easy run to the airport or other onward journeys.\n\nCatering to traveller demand for more suites, Sofitel Brisbane Central has created 15 new Junior Suites, taking the hotel\u2019s suite inventory to 32 Junior Suites, two Prestige Suites and an Opera Suite. My 63-square-metre Junior Suite (priced from $479) on the seventh floor overlooks Post Office Square and the old 1872 sandstone GPO.", "description": "New luxury suites in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, all in the heart of the CBD and close to rail links, make for handy traffic-free work trips.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1284%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bd082a2bfe9f1a0596795e179dae1a1444e02d69", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
