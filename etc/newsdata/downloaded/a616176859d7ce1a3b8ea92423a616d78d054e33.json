He was originally set to spend this weekend in Poland commemorating the start of World War II. However, that trip was canceled as the threat posed by Hurricane Dorian became more clear.\n\nTrump was also seen at the golf course on Saturday.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says that Trump is being briefed on Hurricane Dorian \u201cthroughout the weekend.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump just received a briefing on Hurricane Dorian from @fema officials. It is important that people in FL, GA, NC & SC remain vigilant & take direction from law enforcement & local officials. The @POTUS will continue to be briefed throughout the weekend. \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) August 31, 2019\n\nTrump frequently criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for spending time golfing as President.\n\nPresident Trump has been active on Twitter Monday as well. He has retweeted messages from the National Hurricane Center about the strength and path of Hurricane Dorian, and shared information about the attempted rescue of a boat on fire near California\u2019s Santa Cruz island.\n\nBut earlier on Labor Day, Trump was tweeting about the economy and criticizing the president of the AFL-CIO, a union federation. He also attacked two of his favorite targets: the media and a group of young female Democratic lawmakers known as \u201cThe Squad.\u201d\n\nSince my election, many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our Country, and the Stock Market is up over 50%. If you followed the advice of the Failing New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, you\u2019d be doing VERY poorly - you\u2019d be angry and hurt. He never got it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nJust watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House. Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. We got robbed on Trade and everything else while his Dems just sat back.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nThe Amazon Washington Post did a story that I brought racist attacks against the \u201cSquad.\u201d No, they brought racist attacks against our Nation. All I do is call them out for the horrible things they have said. The Democrats have become the Party of the Squad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nThe LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do \u201cfact checking\u201d anymore, and are only looking for the \u201ckill.\u201d They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nTrump also retweeted a Labor Day message from the White House\u2019s official account.", "description": "He also spent Labor Day criticizing the head of the AFL-CIO", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jjpd8JM5HQ0LFQ5TvmiSog--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/d3aa44fc8a6cc0d3780df4c27e344df3"}
