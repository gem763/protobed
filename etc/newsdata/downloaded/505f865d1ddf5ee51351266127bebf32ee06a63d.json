Developed by the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, the Spellcheck for Bias is designed to analyse a script and determine the percentages of characters\u2019 \u201cgender, race, LGBTQIA [and] disabilities\u201d. It can also track the percentage of \u201cnon-gender-defined speaking characters\u201d.\n\nDavis said that Disney had partnered with her institute to pilot the project: \u201cWe\u2019re going to collaborate with Disney over the next year using this tool to help their decision-making [and] identify opportunities to increase diversity and inclusion in the manuscripts that they receive. We\u2019re very excited about the possibilities with this new technology and we encourage everybody to get in touch with us and give it a try.\u201d\n\nDavis said the plan was not to \u201cshame and blame\u201d, but to reveal any unconscious biases in film projects before they entered production.\n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media was founded in 2007 after the actor \u2013 who won a best supporting actress Oscar in 1989 for The Accidental Tourist \u2013 became concerned about the male-dominated entertainment her young daughter was consuming.\n\nAt the summit, Davis added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough female role models to inspire change. We need to see it in fiction to create the cultural change we need. If we see more women on screen as corporate leaders, scientists and politicians, there will be more women in real life taking up these roles.\u201d", "description": "The actor\u2019s Institute on Gender in Media has announced a new machine-learning tool, to be piloted by Disney, that can analyse scripts and reveal unconscious biases", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc2640cc0fe820fc40f59c443ee5f659d436ed7/0_13_5390_3234/master/5390.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed8aa6a1bf833d2f87184ee5bda207db", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
