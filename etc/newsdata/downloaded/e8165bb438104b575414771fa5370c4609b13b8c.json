I\u2019m a little shocked, but I\u2019m more relieved to learn that this is not a prank. If it was, he\u2019d be greeting me with a camera pointed directly in my face, filming a surprise vlog for his YouTube channel.\n\nJoey is an infamous content creator, known for pumping out controversial stunts and \u201csocial experiments\u201d that show himself and his friends doing just about anything to garner attention and views. It\u2019s worked well enough that 2.5 million people subscribe to his YouTube channel. Now, he\u2019s hoping that popularity will help him win a congressional seat, promising that his home of Staten Island, New York, will be \u201cForgotten No More.\u201d\n\nMuch of his early content was mostly harmless, piggybacking off of television shows like ABC\u2019s What Would You Do? in order to teach viewers valuable moral lessons. But as Joey\u2019s channel grew, so did the stakes and the shock value. He\u2019s double-parked his car just to see how onlookers would react. He\u2019s pretended to abduct children (with parental permission), terrifying them, in hopes that they\u2019d learn not to trust strangers. In 2016, Joey\u2019s videos grew increasingly more political, conveniently when support for Donald Trump was gaining in the polls. He\u2019s gone on to film himself holding up \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d signs in front of grocery stores and attending Trump protests. This content has migrated from YouTube to Twitter where Joey has often criticized the mainstream media and social media platforms of being biased against conservatives like himself.\n\nBut when he opens the door, wearing only gym shorts, he apologizes and tells me he had been cleaning his house before I arrived for our sit-down interview. Before we even have a chance to really speak, he darts away to take a quick shower and tells me: by the way, we\u2019ll be going on a tour of the district instead. Along the way, Joey and his girlfriend Gila Goodman will be handing out donation sheets and filming it for YouTube. He\u2019ll be documenting the entire campaign.\n\nA carefully crafted mixture of strategies belonging to Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaigns\n\nJoey\u2019s bid for Congress is atypical, but his reason for campaigning sounds exactly like what you\u2019d expect a self-described political outsider to say. \u201cI\u2019m a very passionate guy. And I feel like I have the ability to actually make changes in the world. So I got very passionate about politics,\u201d Joey says. \u201cAnd instead of complaining all day on Twitter, I\u2019d actually like to make the jump to actually do something.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Joey has been actively campaigning for the Republican primary in New York\u2019s 11th district for the past two months. A content creator with over 10 million followers across social platforms, he\u2019s been quick to combine what he calls \u201cthe social media game\u201d and \u201cthe ground game\u201d to build a national political profile. Mixing successful playbooks is Joey\u2019s thing, whether that\u2019s on YouTube, running his various marketing businesses, or playing politics. His whole campaign strategy, he tells me, is a carefully crafted mixture of strategies belonging to Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaigns.\n\nAfter hopping out of the shower, Joey slaps on his Make America Great Again hat and prints off his donation sheets. Gila grabs the vlogging camera before we all jump into Joey\u2019s metallic blue Tesla Model S and head out. The Tesla is his second car. It\u2019s a little less conspicuous than his bright yellow Camaro, which car fans easily recognize from his videos.\n\nJoey throws on AC/DC\u2019s \u201cShoot to Thrill\u201d as we peel out of the driveway and tells me, \u201cI love upbeat, fast-paced music because that\u2019s how I work. I\u2019m very fast-paced.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019re off to tour the district and meet with residents \u2014 at least those who Joey has vetted for his vlog. Like the music from the stereo, Joey drives quickly and recklessly. The car stops suddenly, often, my seatbelt cutting into my chest at each stoplight. I\u2019m along for the ride, and it will be like this all day.\n\nOur first stop is only a few short miles away from Joey\u2019s home, a smoothie shop called Baya Bar where one of his best friends, Steve Centineo, works. Aside from Steve, there\u2019s an entire laundry list of Joey\u2019s friends and family who we\u2019ll be meeting: two friends Joey is helping to market a restaurant, his mom\u2019s friend, a fan he met at the gym, and his first boss who runs a popular local pizzeria. Joey isn\u2019t afraid to tell me that he needs to gather donations from just about anyone. His is a grassroots, social media-driven campaign, but he hopes to garner support from New York establishment Republicans as well.\n\nHe\u2019s not off to a bad start, either. Just last month, Joey was photographed with Republican political consultant and infamous dirty trickster Roger Stone at a fundraising event in New York to help cover the former Trump campaign adviser\u2019s legal fees. Across platforms like Instagram, where Stone hasn\u2019t been banned for racist or sexist remarks, he\u2019s become a martyr figure for the far-right.\n\nJoey says Stone was made familiar with his campaign after a friend, who just so happens to be a Salads fan, told him all about it. I ask if he thinks Stone would endorse him. \u201cI think he would,\u201d Joey replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something he\u2019s currently staying out of because of what he\u2019s dealing with.\u201d (Stone was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year for a variety of crimes, including witness tampering and obstruction.) But an endorsement from Stone, Joey says, would be \u201chuge\u201d for his campaign. Stone did not respond to The Verge\u2019s repeated requests to confirm his familiarity with the Salads campaign.\n\nJoey is running for office at a time when the Republican Party is divided on its future, a war that has been waged ever since the establishment came to terms with Trump. The party has long struggled to attain the youth vote, and after Trump\u2019s election, popular far-right internet figures found a home in the Republican Party, often bringing young followings with them. Some Republicans, like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), have begun to entertain the conspiracies and falsehoods peddled by those fringe figures. It\u2019s obvious the party is still shifting, but it\u2019s unclear where it will land. Joey\u2019s hoping to push it in his direction.\n\n\u201cGood kid. He\u2019s a man, but amazing kid.\u201d\n\nAs we pull into Baya Bar, Steve greets Joey and Gila with some kind of chocolate / peanut butter protein shake, knowing his buddy will enjoy it. \u201cJoey is my best friend,\u201d Steve tells me, handing the drink off to his friend. \u201cAbout five years ago, I wasn\u2019t doing so good in life. And if it wasn\u2019t for him, where I am today wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d After working as an HVAC technician and never having moved out of his parent\u2019s house, Steve moved to Los Angeles to live with Joey and film prank videos, living the carefree influencer lifestyle for three years.\n\n\u201cI would trust Joseph with my entire life, literally, because I have. For three years, my life was in his hands,\u201d Steve says. \u201cHe showed me time management, prioritizing, and just everything I need to know for business that I learned. Everything I\u2019m doing now is all because of him.\u201d Steve says he\u2019ll soon be opening up his own Baya Bar franchise in Miami, and he assures me that, without Joey\u2019s help, he may still be living with his parents and working a dead-end job.\n\n\u201cIf I become president,\u201d Joey says, \u201c[Steve is] going to be Secret Service because I need someone who would actually take a bullet for me.\u201d\n\nJoey\u2019s former boss, Frank at Domenico\u2019s Pizza, glows with pride when he sees Joey walk in. Frank tells me how hard Joey worked to sell pizzas at 16, tweaking the restaurant\u2019s operations, forcing them to work more efficiently. \u201cGood kid,\u201d Frank says. \u201cHe\u2019s a man, but amazing kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople would want to stop here a lot, stop for a slice. I would just be in here eating pizza. Kids running by. They\u2019d stop in here and get a picture,\u201d Joey says. He may not know what qualifies a Secret Service agent, but he grasps the fundamentals of grassroots campaigning: \u201cPeople talk. So if someone sees me, \u2018Oh, I saw the YouTube video with Salads driving around. Who\u2019s that?\u2019 And they\u2019d look it up.\u201d\n\nDriving around, I notice how much Joey\u2019s campaign feels like a repeat of Donald Trump\u2019s but on a far smaller scale. Of course, part of this is intentional. Joey knows how and why the Trump playbook worked to get the man elected, and he thinks he can flip NY-11 red once again by implementing it himself.\n\n\u201cSalads\u201d may not be a name that\u2019s synonymous with high-rises and hotels, but just like the president, Joey is, at first glance, the portrait of success \u2014 a kind of success anyway. He\u2019s a world-renowned YouTube star making enough money to at least drive two nice cars without breaking the bank. He\u2019s emblematic of millennial \u201chustle\u201d culture, an entrepreneur with a global profile who\u2019s snagging what he claims to be over $100,000 marketing deals with influential brands. He dates Instagram models and social media stars, and even if he isn\u2019t starring in network reality shows like The Apprentice, he\u2019s a new media icon in his own right on YouTube, which is something that\u2019s far more impressive to young people. He\u2019s living the dream on his own terms. And he wants to help you, too, because, according to Joey, with a little direction, you can be just as successful as him someday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them advice that\u2019s worth a million dollars,\u201d Joey tells me. \u201cI\u2019ll give them advice that, literally, companies are paying me tens of thousands of dollars to give them.\u201d What is that advice? Unclear. Salads says it\u2019s proprietary.\n\nAll of this success has not come without controversy. Joey speaks off the cuff, refuses to be \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d and lives for \u201cowning the libs.\u201d It\u2019s a large part of his appeal, and the engagement he receives for what are often hurtful, transphobic, and racist tweets, memes, and pranks has only helped him garner an eight-figure following, an audience he hopes he can galvanize into votes.\n\n\u201cWhen you backtrack and you find out the context of that photo, you\u2019ll realize I\u2019m not actually a Nazi.\u201d\n\nIn one video with close to a million views from March 2017, he\u2019s dressed as a Nazi with a swastika armband wrapped around his upper arm, wandering around a pro-Trump rally, asking attendees whether they support Nazis. The goal was to disprove the \u201cnarrative,\u201d Joey says, that the \u201cmainstream media\u201d had been pushing. \u201cCNN told me we are [Nazis],\u201d he says to a family at the rally. \u201cThey\u2019re the mainstream media. I thought we were all Nazis.\u201d Screengrabs from that prank follow Joey all across the internet, but they don\u2019t torment him, he says. Popular figures like art critic Jerry Saltz and former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell have all tweeted the photo \u201cout of context,\u201d as Joey likes to say, in order to condemn him as a Nazi.\n\nHow do you feel when someone resurfaces that photo?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking this guy\u2019s an idiot because he\u2019s spreading misinformation,\u201d Joey says. \u201cWhen you backtrack and you find out the context of that photo, you\u2019ll realize I\u2019m not actually a Nazi.\u201d\n\nSo you don\u2019t really hate when people use it?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Joey says, laughing. \u201cI actually prefer it because it\u2019s part of the meme, and it gets a lot of press. And I think part of the meme is, \u2018Haha, look at these idiots promoting a fake photo.\u2019 Obviously, the photo\u2019s not fake, but the context behind it that they\u2019re using is fake. It\u2019s like, \u2018Ha. Another celebrity fell for it. What an idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs we leave Baya Bar, a group of teenagers tries to flag Joey down, waving at him from the outside of the smoothie shop. \u201cGila, record,\u201d Joey demands. \u201cThis is good optics.\u201d\n\nOn Staten Island, Joey is a hometown hero. Online, he\u2019s a prankster who pushes the limits on everything he can say and post. Over the past few days, he\u2019s been pushing for his audience to follow him across all platforms for fear that his Twitter account will be banned as part of a so-far-unproven Republican theory that liberal-leaning Silicon Valley companies are attempting to censor their speech. It\u2019s a great ploy to create the foundations for an incoming (or perhaps ongoing) culture war. It\u2019s also a clever marketing technique to expand his social media reach.\n\nConservative bias is yet another instance of deep right-wing conspiracies bubbling up into the mainstream political discourse. Shadow banning was once only discussed in far-right internet circles, but it\u2019s quickly traveled up the information pipeline and out of establishment politicians\u2019 mouths.\n\nTwitter \u201cSHADOW BANNING\u201d prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2018\n\nNow, platform bias has become a major rallying cry and a powerful campaign message for conservatives. Sen. Ted Cruz, a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, has held hearings on it, and every tech policy discussion in Congress, whether it involves terrorism or data privacy, gets derailed by Republican politicians who are angry about censorship. It\u2019s no longer just calls for action anymore either. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced legislation that would remove a platform\u2019s largest legal shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, if a platform did not agree to submit audits proving that it is unbiased. In the matter of a year, what was once a fringe idea limited to far-right circles on the internet, has culminated into a significant mainstream policy issue.\n\nJoey sees how this information pipeline works, and he plans to capitalize on it. 4chan users, bored with drab politicians and carefully crafted messaging, were drawn to Trump in 2016. He was unconventional and easy to riff on. If elected, trolls were sure Trump would shake up the entire political game: the \u201cswamp\u201d and the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d being imposed on them both online and in real life. That sad irony flowed out of channer communities and into the broader social media ecosystem like nuclear waste, tainting every piece of traditional campaign advertising and marketing with \u201cmeme magic.\u201d\n\nFrom racist and transphobic pranks to placing his penis into a hot dog bun and drizzling mustard on it, Joey seems to get lost in the clout all of the views and social media engagement brings.\n\nOne of the most egregious \u201csocial experiments\u201d Joey pulled was published in October 2016, only a month before Trump officially won the election. In it, Joey leaves a car covered in Trump stickers and flags in what he refers to as a \u201cblack neighborhood.\u201d As he opens up the video, Joey says, \u201cYou may have seen, on the internet and through that polls, that a lot of black people don\u2019t like Trump, and they don\u2019t even like his supporters in some cases.\u201d A title card appears on the video suggesting 30 minutes has passed, and shortly after it fades away, a group of black men arrive. They vandalize the vehicle and beat the windows in with pipes and rocks.\n\nEventually, he did apologize, but not before making a handful of excuses for his behavior\n\n\u201cAs you can see from this video, the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters,\u201d Joey says at the end. \u201cNow when I was filming this video, there were people out the window yelling \u2018F Trump.\u2019 And after filming, I spoke with some of the spectators who were black and said that they did \u2018low key\u2019 support Trump, but they\u2019re afraid of the backlash from their community.\u201d\n\nThe video went viral. Of course it did. It confirmed the racist beliefs held by so many Trump supporters. It was linked on the Drudge Report and received over 2 million views in total. But it was all fake. Shortly after the \u201csocial experiment\u201d was posted, a video surfaced on Twitter outing Joey as a fraud, showing that the black men in the video were laying in wait while he recorded himself in front of the camera. Influential YouTuber and podcaster, h3h3Productions\u2019 Ethan Klein, interviewed Joey after the event, probing him for an apology. Eventually, he did apologize, but not before making a handful of excuses for his behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just seeing them as videos going up with numbers coming in,\u201d Joey says, suggesting he didn\u2019t take into consideration the cultural impact a video like that could have on its audience and YouTube as a platform.\n\nReflecting on that video today, Joey tells me, \u201cI was stuck in that YouTube mindset. When you\u2019re doing that full time, you lose a lot of control.\u201d He continues, \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing because you\u2019re so into the camera. You\u2019re so into your lifestyle and every aspect being recorded, and you lose sight of actual reality because you get stuck in your own world.\u201d\n\nJoey shows some remorse, but not much. \u201cThat was definitely a learning experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, the Nazi photo, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m apologizing for.\u201d\n\nAre you hoping the \u201cmeme magic\u201d we saw with Trump will help get you elected, too?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way of the future,\u201d Joey says. \u201cMemes are the most effective form of advertising.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. When brands aren\u2019t half-heartedly pushing \u201cwoke\u201d ads into our news feeds, their social media accounts are filled with meme-y content. For example, Arby\u2019s social media editors love to draw trending topics and figures onto napkins with the restaurant\u2019s namesake sauce. SunnyD joined in on the existential sadness of millennials, tweeting, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d last February. It was met with support from a cabal of other brands like PornHub and MoonPie that were ready to wipe away the sugary orange beverage\u2019s tears.\n\nBut there\u2019s a dissonance in who Joey is in person and the mask he puts on for the internet. In 2017, he was brought into the h3h3Productions platform once again to talk about his past and his career as a YouTube prankster. He appears shy and quiet. The Kleins probe him on why he films the pranks he does, most of them fake and brazen. Specifically, Ethan Klein asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your passion with the abduction stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets views,\u201d Joey replies. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the views.\u201d\n\nYouTube\u2019s algorithms encourage this kind of behavior. The more outrageous the content is, the more clicks and views it receives and the more money pranksters and creators like Joey make. Platforms are slowly implementing new rules, but enforcement is spotty. As of time of publishing, Joey is still running the racist Trump car prank video on his YouTube channel and profiting from it. Ads are placed before and after the video.\n\nJoey\u2019s a marketer, and it\u2019s obvious that he understands how important messaging is. And with memes and Twitter clapbacks, he\u2019s able to deposit quick, easily digestible campaign messages with a simple image overlaid with text or a quick quote tweet vilifying his political opponents. Staten Island\u2019s Democratic incumbent, Rep. Max Rose, has even noted Joey\u2019s abilities, telling City & State, \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t such a blatant xenophobe, I would think about hiring him. He\u2019s a good marketer!\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cUnfortunately, we have that whole don\u2019t hire racists policy.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly three hours of traipsing through the district, Joey drives me back to his home with Gila. As I\u2019m leaving, she comes in for a hug, and Joey walks me to the door. In a few days, he\u2019ll have his first big campaign event, a speech for the New York Young Republicans Club (NYYRC). He tells me this is part of the \u201cground game,\u201d the handshaking game. He\u2019ll suit up, gel back his hair, and put on his politician mask.\n\nThe speech will be one of Joey\u2019s first big campaign events, testing whether his social media prowess and name recognition add up to anything, politically speaking.\n\nTwo days later, nearly 130 young Republicans crowd the top floor of Jack Demsey\u2019s in midtown Manhattan ahead of the first round of the Democratic presidential primary debates. Joey will be giving one of his first speeches to the crowd, explaining why social media is so critical to his campaign and why he\u2019s the one who should be representing Staten Island in DC.\n\nThose in attendance are largely young and well-dressed, sporting MAGA hats and Trump-Pence shirts as they circulate around the bar laughing and socializing. The New York Young Republicans are a tight-knit group and one of the most active chapters in the country. They\u2019re here to watch the first round of the Democratic presidential debates, prepared to \u201cboo\u201d NYC mayor Bill de Blasio and yell a racist Native American \u201cwar cry\u201d whenever Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks.\n\nJoey\u2019s campaign manager, Vish Burra, is the NYYRC vice president. The position is partly why Burra is so well-known in the establishment Republican scene. Members are pictured frequently with Republican politicians like NYC City Council minority whip Joe Borelli and state party chair Nick Langworthy. But Burra also understands how powerful social media and right-wing internet pundits are. The NYYRC recently had far-right talking head Jack Posobiec address their club, and Burra has helped organize Mike Cernovich\u2019s Night for Freedom event for the past few years as well. (Joey has now personally interviewed Cernovich for his second channel, too.)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re conservative influencers, not traditional influencers. People listen to them, especially people with political interests,\u201d Burra says. \u201cThat\u2019s the new frontier that we\u2019re getting into, and I think Joey is going to be the one to show that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets views. It\u2019s all about the views.\u201d\n\nShortly before the debates begin, Joey is walked up to the top floor of the bar to speak. He\u2019s wearing a giant smile, shaking hands and slapping backs, chumming it up with members as he makes his way to the microphone. \u201cA lot of these Boomer Republicans are doubting me,\u201d he says. \u201cToo many old-school Republicans are taking control of this party. They don\u2019t understand social media. That\u2019s why you see AOC rise to power. She\u2019s indoctrinating the entire youth into her loony left-wing ways because she\u2019s able to reach eight- and 10-year-olds.\u201d\n\nJoey\u2019s jokes and quips targeting public figures from AOC to David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, are met with roaring applause. And as Joey makes his way across the bar to find space to meet with members, he\u2019s swarmed by attendees of all ages who are prepared to donate to his campaign.\n\nJoey is the first major YouTube figure to run for office, and it\u2019s unclear if his following will translate into voter turnout. What is clear, however, is that he\u2019s got the entire social media ecosystem excited (positively and negatively) about a small, hotly contested district in New York City.\n\nWhile Joey is schmoozing the group, Burra, is explaining Joey\u2019s appeal to members \u2014 the social media game and the ground game. Toward the end of the night, I ask Burra how Joey compares to his primary opponent, Nicole Malliotakis, a well-known Republican and current New York state assemblymember.\n\n\u201cShe could be perfect, but you can destroy perfect,\u201d Burra says. \u201cIf you\u2019re all lily-white, if I throw a little speck on you, everyone notices the speck. Joey, on the other hand, he\u2019s full of specks. He\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s very, very hard to destroy interesting, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re banking on.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been tough on Malliotakis on social media, often referring to her as a \u201ctotal joke\u201d or \u201cthe girl\u201d in a disparaging way. It\u2019s another Trumpism, casting powerful women like E. Jean Carroll and Megyn Kelly as opportunists. Malliotakis is running a traditional campaign, sending out newsletters penned by lawmakers endorsing her, like former presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). Malliotakis has clout in the party, and she\u2019s the clear frontrunner at this point in the election cycle.\n\nIf Joey doesn\u2019t win? Well, he has a backup plan. \u201cI have this other political app that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to sell it to other political campaigns. We\u2019re going to try to use my campaign as the example.\u201d He can\u2019t provide me with too many details, but he tells me he wants to be the one to revolutionize the party. Again, he talks about the \u201cground game\u201d and the \u201csocial media game.\u201d\n\nJoey wants the Republican Party to start using the internet differently: post more like Posobiec, tweet more like Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Win or lose, Joey wants to be the guy showing right-wing politicians how to grow their follower counts.\n\n\u201cEven if I get in one term,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI want to be the guy that comes in and teaches everybody: \u2018This is how you do it. This is how it\u2019s supposed to be done.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The Trump-inspired Staten Island native became famous on YouTube for his pranks.
