Photo: Mike Windle/Getty Images\n\nLet us quickly state the obvious: at the very least, singers Camila Cabello, 22, and Shawn Mendes, 21, are both vocally happy the other exists. In the four years since meeting in the summer of 2014, they\u2019ve photobombed each other on the red carpet, recorded a platinum collab, and repeatedly asserted how \u201cproud\u201d they are of one another. That period of their relationship, though, is not currently of interest.\n\nInstead, let us take a closer look at the past few months of Cabello and Mendes\u2019s relationship, during which it \u2014 or at least the narrative around it \u2014 has evolved. Since the end of June, when the pair released an incredibly sexy song and accompanying music video, we\u2019ve seen an astronomical spike in speculation that the pair is more than just friends, which they\u2019ve fueled by making out and holding hands all over the place. But is it actually legitimate?\n\nLet us inspect a timeline of their now-incessant PDA.\n\nJune 21: Cabello and Mendes drop \u201cSenorita\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where it all starts. On June 21, Cabello and Mendes basically spark their own dating rumors when they release \u201cSenorita,\u201d a song featuring pretty suggestive lines, i,e.: \u201cYou say we\u2019re just friends/But friends don\u2019t know the way you taste/\u2019Cause you know it\u2019s been a long time coming/Don\u2019t you let me fall.\u201d Alongside the sexy song, they also release its accompanying music video, which people in office jobs may not want to watch at work.\n\nFour days later, Cabello reportedly broke up with her dating-coach boyfriend. Interesting timing!\n\nJuly 6: They\u2019re spotted holding hands\n\nJust two weeks after dropping their horny song, Cabello and Mendes are spotted with their fingers intertwined after a night \u201cout on the town,\u201d ET! Canada reports. The night apparently ends at Cabello\u2019s place in West Hollywood.\n\nJuly 12: Then they\u2019re spotted kissing\n\nAt last, the pair arrives at first base in San Francisco, which is captured by Pop Crave. Big day!\n\nJuly 29: They enjoy a very open-mouthed pool kiss\n\nBetween their first (photographed) kiss in mid-July and the end of the month, the couple simply cannot stop holding hands and smashing their faces into each other. This notably horny period culminates in their kiss seen round the world: when they aggressively make out (and swallow chlorinated water) in a pool in Miami.\n\nAugust 9: Cabello says she \u201cloves\u201d Mendes\n\nIn an Instagram post dedicated to the big birthday boy, Cabello writes, \u201cHappy birthday to this magic human, I love you!!!!\u201d Read that as you please.\n\nAugust 26: The sensual VMAs performance\n\nMendes and Cabello don\u2019t make out during their VMAs performance of \u201cSenorita,\u201d but they do literally sing the song into each other\u2019s mouths. Outlets describe this as \u201csizzling\u201d and \u201cromantic.\u201d\n\nShawn Mendes and Camila Cabello sign off from their \"Se\u00f1orita\" #VMAs performance pic.twitter.com/Ist9e8ElPx \u2014 MTV NEWS (@MTVNEWS) August 27, 2019\n\nEarly September: Mendes and Cabello talk about being in love (but don\u2019t mention each other)\n\n\ufeffWhile Cabello doesn\u2019t explicitly say Mendes\u2019s name when on the topic of love in her Elle cover story, she appears to be talking about him when she says, \u201cFalling in love is like an infinite amount of levels and layers and angles,\u201d and \u201cI fell in love and just opened up.\u201d (She must be mimicking Mendes, who just days earlier says in an interview that he\u2019s in a relationship but can\u2019t divulge with whom.)\n\nSeptember 9: And then, the real sexy \u201cSenorita\u201d performance\n\nDuring Mendes and Cabello\u2019s performance of the song on the Toronto stop of Mendes\u2019s tour, the duo kisses on stage. In response, the Canadian television show etalk demands \u201ca fire extinguisher ASAP\u201d in its Instagram video of the PDA.\n\nSeptember 12: The cursed make-out video\n\nNot even a week after Timothee Chalamet and Lily Rose-Depp plunged their tongues into each other\u2019s mouths on a yacht in Italy, Mendes posts an Instagram video of himself and Cabello kissing with unnerving gusto. To Mendes and Cabello\u2019s credit, they\u2019re trying to kiss in the most disgusting way possible, in response to trolls who have accused them of \u201c[kissing] like fish.\u201d But still \u2026 this is deeply disturbing.\n\nWhile we previously described the \u201cSenorita\u201d video as potentially NSFW, let us walk back on that a bit: This is the video that you won\u2019t want to watch around your colleagues (or really anyone, for that matter).", "description": "Since June 2019, rumors have swirled that singers Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello are dating.
