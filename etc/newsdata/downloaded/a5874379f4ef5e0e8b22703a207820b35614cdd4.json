The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party have said they would back a general election on 9 December if no deal on 31 October was \u201ctaken off the table\u201d. Downing Street has let it be known that it is considering how to respond.\n\nLabour continues to insist it will not back an election unless there are further assurances that the UK will not crash out on 31 January.\n\nUnder the terms of the extension, the UK has three months more of EU membership but it would be able to leave on the first day of any of those months if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in both Westminster and the European parliament in the meantime.\n\nThe EU has insisted it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement again. The UK also has \u201can obligation\u201d to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee.\n\nBy agreeing the extension through a written procedure, most likely on Tuesday, EU leaders will avoid convening for a summit in Brussels.\n\nThe decision to grant this, the third extension, followed intensive discussions over the weekend, including a conversation between the French president, Emmauel Macron, and Boris Johnson.\n\nAmong weekend developments that persuaded Paris to drop its objections to a further delay of up to three months was \u201cthe significantly more likely prospect of fresh elections, now backed by several parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP\u201d, a French official said.\n\nThe conditions attached to the extension had also been \u201cfurther specified and reinforced\u201d on Saturday and Sunday, the source said, in particular the \u201cnon-renegotiability\u201d of the deal and the fact that the EU27 will be able to work on the bloc\u2019s future plans without the UK.\n\nWhile wishing to preserve the unity of the EU27, which had been their guiding principle throughout the negotiations, the source said, Paris had \u201cinsisted on these conditions as necessary\u201d.\n\nThe terms in the draft agreement are in line with those stipulated under the Benn act, which forced Johnson to ask the EU for a further delay.\n\n\u201cThe period provided for in article 50 (3) TEU as extended by the European council decision (EU) 2019/584 is hereby further extended until 31 January 2020,\u201d the agreement says.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the parties to that agreement complete their respective ratification procedures and notify the depositary of the completion of these procedures in November 2019, in December 2019 or in January 2020, the withdrawal agreement will enter into into force respectively on [the first of the month of the relevant month].\u201d", "description": "Donald Tusk announces \u2018flextension\u2019 which allows UK to leave earlier if deal ratified", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e59d6cd7702eb6ac95caaa8918fe77f1055edb/0_127_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eafb6d3263711507c10af5cd935a4875", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
