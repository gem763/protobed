Definitely. Though those three things together don\u2019t come cheap.\n\nThe 2019 BMW i8 Roadster I\u2019m testing this week, with a bottom-line price of $166,795 (adding only $2,500 for the Tera World Copper package) offers a zero to 60 miles per hour time of just 4.4 seconds (the Coupe is slightly faster), and yet it offers 27 miles per gallon in gas-only mode, and the equivalent of 69 miles per gallon when its plug-in hybrid system is factored in.\n\nFor 2019, the i8 offers 18 miles of electric-only driving via its 11.6 kilowatt-hour lithium battery, and can reach 75 miles per hour solely on battery power. Though the electric motor is only 141 horsepower (up 12 horses from the 2017 model), it also produces 184 foot pounds of torque and doesn\u2019t feel slow (off the line or cruising) in that mode.\n\nAs for green bragging rights, the i8 Roadster\u2019s tailpipe is rated an eight out of 10 (with 10 being the best) for fuel economy and greenhouse gasses by the EPA.\n\nThe gas engine in the i8 is of the type that can only work in a plug-in hybrid (or an economy car)\u2014it\u2019s a gutsy feeling, 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder, producing 228 horsepower. Working together, gas and electric total system power of 369 horsepower. It\u2019s fast because weight was kept down\u2014even as a convertible, it weighs around 3,600 pounds.\n\nThe big news for the i8, which was introduced in 2013, is that folding top. Though I had to search for the button to put it down (it\u2019s behind a door), I found operating the top absolutely delightful. The glass rear window (which is also separately controllable by another switch) goes down, and then the whole assembly quickly folds down into a well, covered by a hard boot. The process takes 16 seconds, and results in a snug cabin, with only very minor wind buffeting.\n\nThe concept version of the i8 was first shown in 2009, so the model is now a decade old but the very extroverted styling hasn\u2019t dated. In fact, it arguably looks better with a soft top. And it certainly hasn\u2019t lost its ability to astonish. Like the company\u2019s earlier M1 supercar, the i8 very exclusive.\n\nAccording to InsideEVs.com, BMW sold 864 i8s in the U.S. through August of this year. The total isn\u2019t broken down into Roadster and Coupe. The market for two-seater performance cars is never going to be large, and i8 owners are not going to see many other examples coming and going.\n\nBMW i8 Roadster.

Once ensconced, the i8 is quite comfortable, even for long drives.\n\nAside from the E-Copper heated leather seats (matching the E-Copper paint) the interior of the i8 Roadster isn\u2019t all that flamboyant. The dash, while certainly functional, is austere in the classic BMW mode. There\u2019s no rear seat, but it\u2019s no big loss\u2014the Coupe\u2019s backseat is mostly for parcels and compliant children. BMW did factor in some space behind the Roadster\u2019s seats, so you can recline for a comfortable position.\n\nThe test car was compliant with Apple CarPlay, but not with Android Auto. The i8 Roadster really showed its colors on a long morning blast, top down, on rural roads around New England. Steering is pin sharp, and braking (through four-wheel, cross-drilled, and ventilated 13-inch discs\u2014painted black via the Tera World package) incredibly assuring. On the highway the big power and torque made passing an easy task, but it wasn\u2019t as special. It\u2019s hard to enjoy convertibles on noisy highways.\n\nThe i8 model has a limited amount of time left. BMW spokesman Jay Hanson tells Penta, \u201cProduction of the i8 will come to an end in Spring 2020 with the last 200 cars being the Ultimate Sophisto Editions.\u201d Those cars, like many of the special editions we write about, will have unique features such as special door plates and badges.\n\nThe BMW i8 is an exotic offering, to be sure, but it does tick all the boxes as a luxury performance cars with a credible claim to be environmentally friendly.\n\nNext up: The Lamborghini Si\u00e1n. Only 63 of these beasts, powered by a V12 engine coupled to an electric motor, will be made. The i8 will be left in the dust, since the Lambo can achieve 62 miles per hour in under 2.8 seconds\u2014about the same as the new Porsche Taycan electric. The Lamborghini can also reach 217 miles per hour.\n\nBut there\u2019s one (major) downside: All 63 have already been snapped up. The i8 Roadster is still available though.", "description": "The plug-in hybrid, introduced in 2013, is now available with a fast-moving convertible top", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107894/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
