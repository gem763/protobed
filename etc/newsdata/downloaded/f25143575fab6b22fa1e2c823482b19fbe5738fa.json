While iPhone revenue still declined 10.3% from the year before \u2014 the fourth consecutive quarter of declines \u2014 it came in ahead of expectations and helped Apple top its own sales forecast.\n\nFull earnings coverage: Apple offers upbeat holiday forecast\n\nApple\u2019s trade-in offer allows customers to sell an older iPhone back to Apple and use the proceeds to get a new iPhone cheaper, a must for many consumers after Apple jacked up their prices two years ago. An increase in trade-in activity suggests more upgrades are happening, which Apple must encourage to keep iPhone revenue steady and avoid down periods.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in the current boom in trade-ins is likely from China, where Apple established the program in Apple retail stores this year while also adjusting its pricing. The effects were seen immediately: In the first half of the fiscal year, Apple\u2019s sales in greater China fell 24.5%, but that decline was cut to 3.2% in the second half of the fiscal year after the trade-in program and pricing changes were fully implemented.\n\n\u201cThe things that we\u2019ve done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have moved the dial,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said in response to a question about Apple\u2019s performance in China on Wednesday\u2019s conference call.\n\nAfter lowering some prices with the new iPhone 11 family of smartphones, which seem to be popular, the confluence could lead to a huge round of upgrades in China despite tariff fears. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told MarketWatch that trade-ins overall have grown to 15% to 20% of upgrade activity from 5% to 7% a year ago. In China, he believes there are 60 million to 70 million iPhones that could stand an upgrade, and iPhone demand is tracking 15% to 20% higher than expectations.\n\n\u201cFor Apple, the No. 1 focus is putting a fence around their install base, and what you\u2019re seeing with the trade-ins is that it\u2019s driving significant upgrade opportunity,\u201d Ives said in a brief phone interview Wednesday afternoon, adding that \u201cpricing was just pure genius in China.\u201d\n\nOpinion: Investors aren\u2019t noticing Apple\u2019s long, slow decline\n\nThe concern with the trade-in program has been a potential decline in Apple\u2019s obese margins on the iPhone, and gross margin did decline to 37.81% in the just-completed fiscal year from 38.37% the year before. Apple will take the slight decline in iPhone gross margin in exchange for greater revenue, however, especially with a growing services business that has even fatter margins.\n\n\u201cThe bears were hanging their hat on margins, but now when you look at these numbers, the bears are going into hibernation,\u201d said Ives, who has an outperform ratings and $265 price target on Apple stock.\n\nApple\u2019s revenue and profit declined in the 2019 fiscal year, but not by as much as expected before Wednesday\u2019s fourth-quarter numbers. To turn that trajectory around, with Apple\u2019s services revenue hitting records and continued growth from wearables such as Airpods and Apple Watch, the company really just needs to maintain iPhone revenue while not destroying profit margins. Judging by Wednesday\u2019s results, trade-ins have Apple on the path to accomplishing that.", "description": "Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone sales completed a year of declines in a Wednesday earnings report, but the drop may have been much worse if it were not for a seemingly...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
