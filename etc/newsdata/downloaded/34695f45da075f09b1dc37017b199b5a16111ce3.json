(\u201cStandard Lithium\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: SLL) (OTCQX: STLHF) (FRA: S5L), is pleased to announce that the final modules of the Company\u2019s \u201cLiSTR\u201d direct lithium extraction Demonstration Plant have been transported to and are currently being installed at Lanxess\u2019 South Plant facility in southern Arkansas (the \u201cSite\u201d).\n\nFabrication and initial QA/QC testing of the final Phase 3 Modules of the Demonstration Plant was completed in early October, and the modules (8 modules in this final Phase 3, plus spare parts) were separated and shipped to the Site. The Phase 3 modules have now arrived at the Site and are in the process of being installed and connected. Current photos of the Demonstration Plant Site, showing the installed modules in Figures 1 and 2 below.\n\nOnce all the modules are installed, the project engineers and contractors will continue connecting and testing all the modules and installing the tie-ins to utilities and services. The commissioning process is scheduled to begin in November.\n\nTwo photos accompanying this announcement are available at:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5e0dd3d4-421c-473a-9aff-51af3b8e7ab4\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ea42156e-8644-48b0-a6c5-54af86935d85\n\nThe Demonstration Plant is designed to continuously process an input tailbrine flow of 50 gallons per minute (gpm; or 11.4 m3/hr) from the Lanxess South Plant, which is equivalent to an annual production of between 100-150 tonnes per annum Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE). The Demonstration Plant is based on Standard Lithium\u2019s proprietary LiSTR technology, that uses a solid sorbent material to selectively extract lithium from Lanxess\u2019 tailbrine.\n\nThe environmentally friendly process eliminates the use of evaporation ponds, reduces processing time from months to hours and greatly increases the effective recovery of lithium.\n\nDr Andy Robinson, Standard Lithium President and COO, commented \u201cour roll-out of the LiSTR direct lithium extraction Demonstration Plant continues to be executed on-schedule, and Standard Lithium would like to thank our project partners for all their efforts in keeping this Project constantly moving forward. We now have a full project team in place, and plant operators are currently undergoing process-specific training. We look forward to beginning the commissioning phase in November and starting the next exciting step of this Project.\u201d\n\nAbout Standard Lithium Ltd.\n\nStandard Lithium (TSXV: SLL) is a specialty chemical company focused on unlocking the value of existing large-scale US based lithium-brine resources. The Company believes new lithium production can be brought on stream rapidly by minimizing project risks at selection stage (resource, political, geographic, regulatory & permitting), and by leveraging advances in lithium extraction technologies and processes. The Company\u2019s flagship project is located in southern Arkansas, where it is engaged in the testing and proving of the commercial viability of lithium extraction from over 150,000 acres of permitted brine operations. The Company is currently installing a first-of-its-kind Demonstration Plant that will use the Company\u2019s proprietary technology to selectively extract lithium from LANXESS\u2019 tailbrine. This Demonstration Plant will be used to prove commercial feasibility. The environmentally friendly process eliminates the use of evaporation ponds, reduces processing time from months to hours and greatly increases the effective recovery of lithium.\n\n\n\nThe Company is also pursuing the resource development of over 30,000 acres of separate brine leases located in southwestern Arkansas and approximately 45,000 acres of mineral leases located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California.\n\nStandard Lithium is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol \u201cSLL\u201d; quoted on the OTC - Nasdaq Intl Designation under the symbol \u201cSTLHF\u201d; and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cS5L\u201d.
