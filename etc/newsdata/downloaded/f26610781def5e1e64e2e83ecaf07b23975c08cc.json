I don't have necessarily a predetermined plan on how many innings, how many pitches,\" manager AJ Hinch said.\n\n\"It's Game 4 of the World Series. All things are being considered,\" he said.\n\nAces Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke started the first three games and none of them put on a dominant performance.\n\nNow it'll be a 24-year-old righty who made his big league debut in early July. He went 2-1 with a 3.95 ERA in nine games for Houston and has pitched twice in the postseason \u2014 he's allowed one run in 4 1/3 innings, striking out eight.\n\nHinch said a couple things factored into his decision.\n\n\"The lineup, it's not just a one-size-fits-all strategy when you're facing different teams,\" he said.\n\n\"You take the first four hitters, when you think about starting a game, and if you're going to go bullpen, you better have somebody that's pretty good at a little bit of everything. Those are four distinctly different guys,\" he said.\n\nUrquidy fully appreciates the chance.\n\n\"Very few Mexicans have had this opportunity and for me to be in this position I'm obviously very happy about that,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm living the dream,\" he said.\n\nAILING\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki hurt his right hip flexor trying to block a pitch in the dirt and exited after six innings. His status for Game 4 was uncertain.\n\n\"We don't know the severity of it yet,\" manager Dave Martinez said after the loss. \"We'll know more tomorrow.\"\n\n\"His strength was good but we'll see. I don't know if he's going to get an MRI,\" he said. \"But we'll see how he feels tomorrow.\"\n\nSuzuki struck out twice before Yan Gomes replaced him. Suzuki hit a tiebreaking home run in Game 2 that sent the Nationals to a rout.\n\nPatrick Corbin is set to pitch next for the Nationals and Gomes is his regular catcher.\n\n___\n\nSTRUGGLING\n\nAlex Bregman could win the NL MVP award. But right now, he's looking lost in the World Series.\n\nBregman was hitless in five at-bats and stranded six runners Friday night, hardly what Houston has seen from the All-Star third baseman this season.\n\nBregman is only 1 for 13 through three games against Washington. His lone hit was a two-run homer in Game 2 \u2014 he also made a throwing error in that loss.\n\nAfter hitting 41 home runs with 112 RBIs and batting .296, Bregman says he sees signs of bouncing back.\n\n\"It felt good, not great, but good. I put good swings on the ball and I think every time I go up to hit I have confidence that I'm going to get the job done and hit the ball hard somewhere,\" he said.\n\nTeammate Michael Brantley is confident, too.\n\n\"I'm not worried about Alex. You saw what he did. He's a great player. He had some good at-bats, he lined out, he hit the ball hard,\" he said.\n\n\"He'll find his breaks. I can't wait to see him come out tomorrow, I'm ready,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nCORBIN READY\n\nAfter pitching in relief in the Series opener, Nationals lefty Patrick Corbin was poised to start Game 4.\n\n\"These are games I want to pitch in,\" he said Friday afternoon. \"This is what you prepare for all offseason, to pitch in these games and just to have the opportunity to go out there, give it my best.\"\n\nSigned as a free agent during the offseason, Corbin went 14-7 with a 3.25 ERA in 33 starts for Washington.\n\nHe's 1-2 with a 6.91 ERA in six appearances this postseason.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Ginsburg contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
