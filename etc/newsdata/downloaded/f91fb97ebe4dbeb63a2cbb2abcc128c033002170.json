It is achieved by transacting crypto for fiat currency and then rolling back the deed to recuperate the spent crypto while pocketing the fiat.\n\nResponding to the question of how to mitigate such a threat, Maxwell robustly argued that any such attempt necessarily compromises decentralization at the heart of the Bitcoin project.\n\nHe noted that Bitcoin focuses on solving the problem of achieving consensus on a stable history of transactions. This issue can intuitively be solved by establishing the \u201cfirstness\u201d of a given transaction, rendering duplicate subsequent operations invalid. Maxwell continued:\n\n\u201cIn a truly decentralized system \u2018first\u2019 is actually logically meaningless! As an inescapable result of relativity the order which different parties will perceive events depends on their relative positions, no matter how good or fast your communication system is.\u201d\n\nAnti-51% fixes \u2018centralize the system but just hide the centralization\u2019\n\nMaxwell criticized more centralized systems \u2014 naming Ripple, EOS and IOTA \u2014 for resorting to a single party determining firstness and imposing this on the rest of the network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fundamentally decentralized nature instead relies on the \u201cvote\u201d of computing power through mining without the involvement of any centralized third party.\n\nMaxwell argued that any mechanism that would allow to prevent the \u201crigging\u201d of this \u201cvote\u201d \u2014 by one party or several \u2014 \u201cwould almost certainly let you just replace mining entirely.\u201d He explained:\n\n\u201cPeople have cooked up 1001 complicated schemes that claim to do it without introducing centralization, but careful analysis finds again and again that these fixes centralize the system but just hide the centralization.\u201d\n\nA far bigger risk to Bitcoin than the reordering of transaction history that 51% attacks could lead to, Maxwell concluded, is that:\n\n\u201cThe public using it won't understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the first place.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, crypto exchange Gate.io pledged to reimburse users this January after finding out that a 51% attack had successfully occurred on the Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchain.", "description": "Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell criticizes the \u201cattractive mystery\u201d that fear of a 51% attack on Bitcoin entails, adding that every possible solution is cen...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDM2YmJkYzZkYWRkYmRmODA4MWM2ZDU5YWRkMDlhMzUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
