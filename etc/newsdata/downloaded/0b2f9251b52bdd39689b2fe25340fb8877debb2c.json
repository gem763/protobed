She looks pretty effective by current standards. \u201cBloody difficult woman\u201d, for sure, publicly awkward, untalented dancer, yes all that, but she\u2019d treat the Commons, the opposition and indeed her own party rather better than this lot.\n\nEven her own terrible twins, special advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, were like docile Labrador puppies compared to the rabid pit bull terrier Dominic Cummings, who the PM now answers to.\n\nMay distrusted the old Notting Hill set \u2013 Cameron, Gove, Osborne, plus Johnson \u2013 because of their larkish student politics approach. She was not into politics as a game, an extension of the Oxford Union. She would not languish about, bored, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, disrespecting the House.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She wouldn\u2019t threaten to break laws she didn\u2019t like or drag her majesty into a party political row.\n\nThe opposition parties could assume May would keep her word: there was personal trust and integrity.

The great dynamic change promised by Johnson has not materialised. The Tory party remains split, possibly more so than ever. The Commons still wants to block no deal, yet still cannot plan a way forward. The EU is still waiting for the answer to the Irish backstop conundrum, and is as unpersuaded as ever about the UK\u2019s \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. The country is still bitterly frustrated.\n\nNothing has changed, then, with the arrival of Boris Johnson. Except perhaps the opportunity to test out the theory that the only reason that May and Brexit failed was because she was \u201calways a Remainer\u201d, because she lacked the skills to get the elusive deal through Parliament, because she failed to threaten no deal in order to make the EU compromise, and so on.\n\nThere was a whiff of male chauvinism around. We see now that was a false prospectus. Indeed it rather seems that Johnson hasn\u2019t even made much effort to get a deal anyway \u2013 no proposals even tabled at the EU.\n\nWe've long seen that Brexit isn\u2019t working because of the sheer weight of its internal contradictions.\n\nJohnson thought we could have our cake and eat it, as he amusingly quipped. The Tories were enraptured by his positive energy, fancying it would free them from their purgatory. More sensible, May warned everyone that the Boris way would fail, but was sacked for her trouble. Johnson promised to save Brexit. He has failed too.\n\nTheresa May hasn\u2019t yet stood up from her new Commons perch next to Ken Clarke to declare \u201cI told you so\u201d, but she really ought to. Her occasional smiles yesterday told a story of their own.\n\nMay\u2019s was and is the only signed off UK-EU deal. Now Labour figures such as Stephen Kinnock want to revive it, given the ghastly alternatives. That will not work. Nothing has changed, too, in the sense that parliament won't vote for it, and cannot spring us from this trap and resolve Brexit.\n\nAs of today, we can\u2019t have an election, we can\u2019t leave under no deal, parliament can\u2019t agree on a new deal, the EU seems reluctant to indulge in magical thinking \u2026 only the people themselves can break the deadlock with a fresh referendum. It is the eternal logic, and changing the team at No 10 hasn\u2019t changed that either.", "description": "Is it too soon to make a plea to bring back Theresa May? You remember her, surely.
