If farmers lessen their pesticide use, it can both help the environment and their gross margins. \u201cGreater yields may be achieved by either increasing agrochemicals or increasing bee abundance, but crop economic returns were only increased by the latter,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nGo deeper: USDA suspends honeybee colony research", "description": "A 4-year study showed pollinating insects boosted margins for farmers in France.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/rWnpmCD2FTkPuDolYCtcdOYeBWk=/0x110:2677x1616/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570656117228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
