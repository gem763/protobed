Bishop also read the race brilliantly, following an attack by the Italian great Maria Canins, who would go on to win the women\u2019s Tour de France twice, before breaking away on a downhill section and then effectively time-trialling the last six miles to victory. \u201cI looked around, there was a gap and I just went,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were screaming and shouting - \u2018They\u2019re behind you!\u2019 - it was like a pantomime. My legs killing. It was only on the last bend to the finish that I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got this\u2019.\u201d Bishop recalls her television interview with Hugh Porter being partially interrupted by her mum simply shouting \u2018Mandy!\u2019 when she saw her world champion daughter and then having nothing to change into before cycling back to the team hotel complete with her new rainbow jersey, medal and \u201cmaybe a GB jacket over the top\u201d.\n\nThe men\u2019s race had started by this time. \u201cI was looking at the helicopter and knew where the race was so that I could pull in at the right times but there was this policeman. He had his hand up, telling me to stop and get off the road,\" she says.\n\n\u201cAll the people behind him were shouting, \u2018Mandy, Mandy! You can\u2019t stop her, she\u2019s the world champion\u2019.\u201d With the medal and rainbow jersey for proof, a police escort was eventually arranged and she arrived back at the hotel, still in her race gear, some three hours after crossing the line. Bishop\u2019s first reaction to winning, however, would prove instructive.\n\n\u201cIn the interview straight after with Hugh, I said: \u2018I\u2019ll have a year off.\u2019 The aim had always been, \u2018let\u2019s try and win the worlds in the UK. Home crowd, home roads.\u2019 It was the focal point. What we didn\u2019t think about was what happens if you win. My head had fallen off big time.\u201d It was a time when the best British women were lucky to have even a mechanic helping them at an international race and simply trained independently, finding ways to finance their own equipment, travel, training and living costs. Bishop thinks now that she could have continued and won another world title with more support but even the prospect of the Olympics in 1984 could not motivate her. \u201cI could not have coped with it this year - my mind was not in the right gear,\u201d she wrote in her diary.\n\nBishop still remained good enough to finish her career with 19 national titles but, after an operation near her calf in 1986, a return to form in 1991 potentially ahead of the Barcelona Olympics was derailed by a serious back injury that would end her career. She can still recall literally finishing one training ride by crawling through the front door.\n\nNow 57, Bishop later began running and completed mountain marathons with husband Nigel, a former Milk Race rider with whom she now runs Fawkes Cycles in Oldham, and they have never stopped cycling for pleasure. She will also be in Harrogate to see the women\u2019s race. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful course out through the Dales but I think they will find it very tough - none of it\u2019s flat,\u201d she says, before smiling at the prospect of rain. \u201cLizzie [Deignan] was born down the road - she will like it if the weather is horrible.\u201d", "description": "Mandy Bishop brought her old training diary along to this interview and, while there was sometimes a detailed memory of a particular race or training ride, the entry for September 4, 1982 remains gloriously short.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000210093874-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
