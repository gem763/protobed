Angie Craig said. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images Congress Vulnerable Democrats seek impeachment guidance from Pelosi Swing-seat lawmakers are worried about keeping up with the Ukraine scandal's fast-moving developments.\n\nSwing district House Democrats are seeking more help from leadership on how to handle the impeachment drive as they enter the most perilous stretch of their brief congressional careers.\n\nSeveral junior lawmakers on Thursday voiced concerns in a closed-door meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders that they are struggling to keep up with their party\u2019s message on the Ukraine scandal rapidly engulfing President Donald Trump, according to multiple people in the room.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Pelosi and her deputies listened and took notes, freshmen from competitive districts suggested they needed more real-time guidance to keep up with the fast-moving developments in the age of Twitter and near-instant leaks. Members said they were often dismayed to learn of major news through tweets or in news accounts \u2014 and some vented about leaks from internal caucus meetings.\n\n\u201cThe speaker listened. That\u2019s all she did today. The speaker listened to us,\u201d Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) said, adding that the majority of the vulnerable \u201cfront-liners\u201d told Pelosi they want to keep the spotlight on the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a district where I think I\u2019ve been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective of, I want to be disciplined, I want to look at due process, and I want to make sure we have all of our facts. And this inquiry will allow us to do that,\u201d Craig added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very supportive of Adam Schiff and what he and his committee [are doing].\u201d\n\nLawmakers also told leadership that they wanted to see new messengers making the rounds on TV as the impeachment inquiry ramps up \u2014 not the usual rotation of Judiciary Committee members.\n\nThe meeting came a day before Democrats are set to return to their home districts for a two-week recess, where lawmakers will face their constituents for the first time since the House\u2019s leap toward impeachment.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nSince Pelosi embraced an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, House Democrats have united in their outrage over Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier Thursday, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire frustrated lawmakers with his explanation of why he initially withheld from lawmakers a whistleblower complaint that detailed Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe complaint, which was released publicly Thursday morning, states that senior White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s bid to pressure Zelensky and that aides tried to \u201clock down\u201d records of the phone call.\n\nSome of the discussion during Thursday\u2019s meeting centered on a fear of leaks within the caucus, and lawmakers emerged from the meeting uncharacteristically tight-lipped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to share what just happened in that meeting,\u201d said Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), a refrain that reporters heard over and over as members exited the private huddle.\n\nPelosi, who called the meeting, pitched it as a listening session with her and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.). Several lawmakers described it as largely a question-and-answer session after weeks of privately fretting about the caucus\u2019 lack of direction and disunity on impeachment.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened is we have been focused by an event that clearly is a violation of law and a violation of national security. So [to] that extent, yes we\u2019re focused,\u201d Hoyer told reporters as he exited. \u201cI think we want to be unified and I think everybody shares that view.\u201d\n\nThe hourlong discussion, which was attended by more than two dozen freshman Democrats from the toughest districts in the country, ended with two rounds of applause.\n\nThe meeting comes after a tense week in which many moderate Democrats privately and publicly griped that the Democratic caucus lacked a clear strategy on impeachment at a pivotal point.\n\nVulnerable Democrats, particularly freshmen, were dismayed by the party\u2019s handling of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report and were eager to change course as the focus shifted to the Ukraine episode.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), co-chair of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, has publicly called for a select committee to lead the caucus\u2019 impeachment push; several members privately said they wanted it to be led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nThe idea of a select committee wasn't raised during the meeting, but the freshmen stressed that they wanted Schiff to play a prominent role in the ongoing investigation, according to multiple people in the room.\n\nIt\u2019s not just first- and second-term Democrats who have fretted over the party\u2019s strategy.\n\nTwo senior members debated the caucus\u2019 tactics in a separate closed-door meeting on Thursday morning. Rep. Rosa Delauro (D-Conn.), said she wanted the Intelligence Committee to take the lead. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) countered that Democrats shouldn\u2019t sideline the other investigations, according to multiple people in the room.\n\nPelosi, who called the Ukraine scandal a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d later made clear that Schiff\u2019s committee would determine the pace of Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation, even as the Judiciary Committee will maintain control over the overall impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cOur consensus in our caucus is that we will proceed under the auspices of where this matter is relevant and that is in the Intelligence Committee,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at a weekly news conference. \u201cThe timeline relates to how the committee proceeds and our timeline will spring from them.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "Swing-seat lawmakers are worried about keeping up with the Ukraine scandal's fast-moving developments.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/58/2e/877aaabf4e308a7b7726324ca406/190926-angie-craig-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
