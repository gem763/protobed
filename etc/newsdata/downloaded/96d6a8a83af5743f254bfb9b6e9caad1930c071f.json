January 9: He allows a rebel amendment brought by Dominic Grieve forcing then prime minister Theresa May to come back to the Commons with a revised Brexit plan if her withdrawal agreement failed to pass. The original business motion was put 'forthwith', which was previously taken to mean that it should be dealt with without a debate or chance of amendment. The amendment passed by 11 votes and the WA was heavily defeated. March 18: The Speaker blocks a third meaningful vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. In a dramatic intervention, he ruled that the EU withdrawal agreement could not be put to a vote again without substantial changes. He gave Downing Street no notice of his announcement, which came just 24 hours before the Prime Minister was expected to ask the Commons to decide on the issue for a third time following two crushing defeats. March 18: Mr Bercow advises Remainer MPs on how they might use Parliamentary procedure to alter the Brexit deal after it is voted down a second time. He suggests they can use Standing Order 24 to sidestep the Government and push through backbench legislation. Usually SO24 motions should be neutral but he allows binding votes to introduce things like the Benn Act, blocking a No deal Brexit. August 28: Mr Bercow led a chorus of outrage over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament. The Commons Speaker said he was on holiday with his family and had not been consulted about the move, which he labelled a 'constitutional outrage'. Mr Bercow said the plan to shut down Parliament from around September 11 until the state opening on October 14 was an 'offence against the democratic process'. September 25: He gloats that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament had been 'expunged' by a bombshell Supreme Court ruling as he reopened Parliament. Telling MPs 'welcome back to our place of work', he spelled out that the suspension triggered by the PM earlier this month had been made void - as legally it never happened. he had vented his fury at the prorogation happening in the first place. October 21: He blocks Boris Johnson's latest bid to trigger a vote on his Brexit deal. MPs denied the PM 'in principle' approval for his deal over the weekend, instead postponing the showdown and obliging him to ask the EU for an extension. Mr Bercow insisted the 'meaningful' vote would break the Commons convention against asking MPs the same question twice in quick succession.\n\nThe source said: 'First 19 Labour MPs vote for Brexit and face no sanction, now Jeremy Corbyn refuses to back a People\u2019s Vote in Parliament. Remainers are seeing whose side Jeremy Corbyn is on.'\n\nMPs will vote on Mr Johnson's blueprint for the country shortly after 5pm this evening.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be hopeful of winning the vote if he is able to persuade the DUP and former Tory rebels to back his new domestic legislative agenda.\n\nThe DUP and many ex-Tory MPs are opposed to the PM on Brexit but it is thought they could yet back the Queen's Speech on the grounds there is nothing in it with which they substantially disagree.\n\nIf Mr Johnson is able to get those two groups on board he should be able to secure a narrow victory.\n\nBefore the introduction of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a Queen's Speech vote was treated as a confidence matter.\n\nThat meant that if a government lost the vote on its plans it would fall and a new administration would have to be formed or a general election would have to be held.\n\nBut the FTPA changed the rules on the holding of elections which means that even if the government loses today it is expected to press on with the draft laws it has proposed regardless.\n\nOne government source said that the legislation introduced by the coalition meant Queen's Speech votes had been 'rendered meaningless'.\n\nHowever, a defeat for Mr Johnson would be humiliating because it would show he has no chance of getting his legislative agenda through the Commons.\n\nA defeat would also harden Downing Street's view that there must be a general election in the near future.\n\nThe Lib Dems' amendment would have approved the Queen's Speech but then added a poison pill at the end of it.\n\nIt stated: 'At end add \"but believe that your Government should make arrangements for a people\u2019s vote in which the public will have the choice between the latest withdrawal agreement and remaining in the European Union\".'\n\nA Lib Dem source told MailOnline this morning before Mr Bercow made his decision that the success of the amendment hinged on formal Labour support.\n\nThe source said: 'At every important Brexit vote the Lib Dems have given the chance to MPs to back a People\u2019s Vote.\n\n'It will only work if Labour, SNP and Tory moderates come towards us. The ball is in their court.'\n\nMs Swinson had written to Mr Corbyn to urge him to formally back the amendment but he failed to do so.\n\nThe selection of amendments is entirely in the gift of Mr Bercow. The level of support for proposals is believed to be a major determining factor in the Commons Speaker's decisions.", "description": "The Liberal Democrats had put forward an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling for the Prime Minister's Brexit deal to be put to a national vote against the option to Remain.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20138584-0-image-a-52_1571929589779.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
