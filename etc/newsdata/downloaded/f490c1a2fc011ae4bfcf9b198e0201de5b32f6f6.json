It also said revenue for the three months ending in December would top out at $1.01 billion rather than the projected $1.06 billion.\n\nIts shares fell 15 percent after the market opened.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGreater-than-expected advertising seasonality\u201d and \u201crevenue product issues\u201d were to blame for the disappointing results, the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nTwitter earlier this year outlined settings issues that had allowed it to access users\u2019 data without permission to display targeted advertisements and measure their effectiveness for marketers. Its letter indicated that removing that data adversely affected the company.\n\nThe company was far more bullish on Thursday about user growth in the third quarter, saying it added 6 million daily active users to reach 145 million. That marked a 17 percent increase from a year ago and a 4 percent quarter-to-quarter increase.\n\n\u201cDespite its challenges, this quarter validates our strategy of investing to drive long-term growth,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMore work remains to deliver improved revenue products. We\u2019ll continue to prioritize our ad products along with health and our investments to drive ongoing growth\u201d in daily active users the company can monetize, he added.", "description": "Twitter shares plunged on Thursday after the\u00a0company reported third-quarter sales that missed\u00a0expectations and said fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than projected.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/events/twitter_logo_blue.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
