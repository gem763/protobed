Now it's just sapping growth.\n\nThree decades ago, an unlikely coalition changed fiscal norms: how we think about budget deficits. Ivory-tower academics, self-interested businesspeople, faceless bureaucrats, cautious households and libertarian politicians, all came to agree on one thing: active fiscal policy should not be used to counter the business cycle. What started as a necessary correction of an overuse of budget deficits became a doctrinal balanced-budget fetish. Now it\u2019s time restore common sense.\n\nThe story begins in the 1960s. The combination of the Vietnam War, LBJ\u2019s Great Society and the moon landing put such pressure on US capacity that inflation was inevitable. Once the inflation-expectations genie was out of the bottle, the 1970s stagflation followed, as tight policy attempted to counter inflation\u2019s persistence. Both fiscal and monetary policy, working together, eventually did the job, but at great cost to output and employment: the Volcker deflation in the USA and the \u2018recession we had to have\u2019 in Australia.\n\nThe policies that made sense after the 1970s do not do so now. Louie Douvis\n\nThis painful period incubated a rethink of fiscal policy. Academics abandoned the Keynesian view in which fiscal policy was a powerful instrument to ensure full employment. Instead, it was argued that budget deficits would spill overseas into imports, push up interest rates and crowd out private-sector expenditures. Higher public debt would make consumers cut expenditure, anticipating future tax increases. Econometricians mined the data to provide evidence that government debt stunted growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thatcher/Reagan revolution was underway, extolling free markets, private enterprise and radical deregulation. The moment was right, as both the USA and the UK had sclerotic institutions in need of shaking up. Like all revolutions, it was driven by fanatics and went too far. But the central fiscal message stuck: governments should run small balanced budgets.\n\nBusiness found this new doctrine congenial. What is there not to like about minimal regulation and low tax? Budget balance kept the government out of funding markets, giving free rein to profit-maximisation, with the comforting assurance that this was in the best interests of all.", "description": "Small government that did not crowd out the private sector once made sense.
