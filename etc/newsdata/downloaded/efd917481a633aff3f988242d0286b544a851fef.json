Her topic--which is also the focus of her latest book--was leadership in turbulent times. Specifically, the Pulitzer Prize winner examined leadership as it related to four U.S. presidents: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B.

Further, their unique approaches fit the historical moment during which they led, just as a key fits a lock.
