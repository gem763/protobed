The second-last week of October is Canadian Waste Reduction Week. And this Friday, October 4 is World Smile Day.\n\nIf CAA-Quebec get its way, Canadians in one province will celebrate another special week at the very start of October \u2014 it\u2019s lobbying to declare those seven days \u201cQuebec\u2019s official Winter Tire Appointment Week.\u201d\n\nReally? Yes, really, came the reply from the Canadian Automobile Association\u2019s Quebec division. \u201cBetween the labor shortage and the new earlier legal deadline for winter tires (December 1), there\u2019s likely to be a mad rush on garages that do tire changes,\u201d the organization recently wrote. \u201cSo the smart thing to do is to take care of it now!\u201d\n\nCAA-Quebec is not saying motorists should swap their summer rubbers for a set of winter tires right this minute. No, it\u2019s just telling the owners of the province\u2019s 5.2 million passenger vehicles that now is better than later to book a rendezvous with their mechanic shop.\n\nSo when specifically should you book that appointment for? We asked The Weather Network and its meteorologist Andr\u00e9 Monette was able to provide \u201crealistic dates\u201d when drivers in Canadian major cities should make their summer-to-winter tires swap (i.e. when the average temperature drop below the magic 7 \u00b0C).\n\nQuebec\n\nKuujjuaq: September 25\n\nSept-\u00celes: October 20\n\nVal-d\u2019Or and Saguenay: October 25\n\nRimouski and Gasp\u00e9: October 30\n\nQuebec City, Gatineau and Sherbrooke: November 5\n\nMontreal: November 10\n\nMaritimes and Labrador\n\nSaint-Jean: November 7\n\nFredericton: November 9\n\nCharlottetown: November 10\n\nMoncton: November 10\n\nSydney: November 12\n\nHalifax: November 12\n\nGoose Bay: October 14\n\nOntario\n\nTimmins: October 26\n\nThunder Bay: November 1\n\nSudbury: November 2\n\nOttawa: November 9\n\nKingston: November 11\n\nToronto: November 15\n\nWindsor: November 21\n\nWest and Prairies\n\nChurchill: September 24\n\nYellowknife: September 27\n\nWhitehorse: October 9\n\nSaskatoon: October 27\n\nEdmonton: October 28\n\nRegina: October 29\n\nWinnipeg: October 30\n\nKelowna: November 9\n\nPrince Rupert: November 16\n\nVancouver: December 11\n\nVictoria: December 17\n\nYou\u2019re already too late if your hometown is Kuujjuaq, but know that for Montreal, November 10 is halfway between the average date of the first snowfall (October 28) and that of the first real accumulation of 5 cm or more (December 3), says CAA-Quebec.\n\nOh, for those who think the first snowfall determines the right time to swap, here\u2019s a little news for you: the temperature actually determines when, and the magic number is 7 \u00b0C.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Summer or four-season tires start to harden and gradually lose their grip when the mercury drops below 7 \u00b0C, says Pierre-Serge Labb\u00e9, CAA-Quebec Vice-President, Automotive Services. \u201cThese realistic dates, proposed in consultation with The Weather Network, are the dates when the average daily high is below 7 \u00b0C for each region in Quebec.\u201d\n\nBut remember this: Because those dates are an average, they are the latest you should wait to install your winter rubbers. And now that the summer\u2019s heat is no longer threatening our costly winter tires, there\u2019s no harm in trading them a few weeks earlier.\n\nAsk Calgary, just for fun, if there\u2019s a too-soon moment to have winter tires on your car\u2014", "description": "CAA-Quebec is urging drivers in La Belle Province to book their winter tires swap \u2014 and suggests an Official Winter Tire Appointment Week", "authors": ["Days Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/winter-tires-canada-quebec-mandatory-6-rd.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
