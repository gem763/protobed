The aircraft undertook a surveillance mission over the Yellow Sea, observing key missile test sites in North Korea like the launch pad at Tongchang-ri in North Pyongan Province.Tuesday\u2019s deployment of the RC-135U suggests Washington is keeping a close watch for another weapons test by Pyongyang. An RC-135U was also deployed around the Korean Peninsula in November 2017, when North Korea claimed it had successfully tested the Hwasong-15, an intercontinental ballistic missile supposedly capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.Throughout this year, the North has conducted a total of 11 weapons tests, with the most recent on Oct. 3, when it was believed to have tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile.Days later, on Oct. 6, Aircraft Spots detected the arrival of two U.S. E-8C Joint Stars surveillance aircraft at Kadena Air Base, planes that were used by the United States in the past to surveil North Korean missile activity.The same day, the first denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea in eight months ended fruitlessly in Stockholm, with Pyongyang\u2019s top nuclear envoy Kim Myong-gil implying the country\u2019s moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests would be reconsidered if Washington did not change its position in the negotiations.\u201cIf the United States is not properly ready, who knows what horrible disasters can occur,\u201d Kim told reporters the next day. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201dThe increased likelihood of another provocation from Pyongyang with the failure of talks prompted Washington to additionally deploy an RC-135S Cobra Ball to Okinawa, the same aircraft it used in March, July and August to observe North Korean military activities.According to one South Korean military official, \u201cthe recent appearances of several of the United States\u2019 main reconnaissance aircraft around the Korean Peninsula show that the United States has detected something unusual in North Korea.\u201dWhile there have been no overt signs of an imminent weapons test in the North in recent days, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s visits to locations outside of Pyongyang - like the Mount Kumgang tourism area and a hot springs resort in Yangdok County, South Pyongan Province - leaves open the possibility he may oversee another test as he did several times over the summer while apparently vacationing near Wonsan in Kangwon Province.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK, LEE KEUN-PYUNG [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
