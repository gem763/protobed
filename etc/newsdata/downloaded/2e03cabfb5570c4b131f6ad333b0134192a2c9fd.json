Meanwhile, Asian and European markets get a boost from some more positive sounds out of Beijing and Brussels, while Turkey's financial markets shrug off \"obliteration\" from President Trump's sanctions. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 15th October.\n\n1. A barrage of bank earnings\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season swings into gear big time as Wall Street\u2019s big banks report their numbers.

Chinese, European economies stutter\n\nChina\u2019s economy continued to struggle, with fresh data showing dropping 1.2% on the year in September. That\u2019s the biggest drop since 2016 and a further indication of factories being hit by the country\u2019s trade dispute with the U.S. , meanwhile, rose at their highest rate in six years, thanks largely to the continued scarcity of pork due to the Asian swine flu epidemic.\n\nBeijing has instructed its central bank to keep credit to companies flowing to cope with the slowdown. , the country\u2019s broadest measure of credit, rose much faster than expectations in September, while yuan lending rose 12.5% on the year.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, Brexit concerns finally caught up with the U.K.\u2019s labor market, causing to fall by 56,000 in the three months through August.

Turkish markets recover after mild sanctions\n\nTurkey\u2019s currency and stock and bond markets bounced after President Donald Trump failed to follow through on threats to \u201cobliterate\u201d its economy with sanctions if it stepped out of line in Syria.\n\nThe U.S. doubled tariffs on imports of steel from Turkey to 50%, and applied to several Turkish officials, including the defense, energy and interior ministers, as well as the Turkish government\u2019s defence and energy departments.\n\nThe strengthened as much as 1% before paring gains to 0.2%, trading at 5.9142 per dollar as of 11:48 a.m. in Istanbul. Turkey\u2019s main climbed 1.5%. The gains only partly unwound losses made in anticipation of the U.S.\u2019s measures, however.\n\nThe U.S. administration is calling for a ceasefire in Syria, given the heightened risk of direct clashes between Turkish forces and those of President Assad, who has temporarily reconciled himself with the Kurdish rebels targeted by Ankara.\n\n5. Warren's chance to stake her claim\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls hold their latest televised debate at 8 PM ET (2200 GMT). It's an opportunity for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to cement her recent gains in the polls at the expense of former vice-president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, her most formidable rival on the left of the party.\n\nBiden has reportedly warned other candidates against taking up President Trump's accusations of wrong-doing by his son Hunter Biden, who this week said he would no longer serve on the boards of any foreign company.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden's lead over Warren has shrunk to 3 points. Warren has now leapfrogged Sanders into 2nd place polling an average 23%, compared to Biden's 26% and Sanders' 16%.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0K0YG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
