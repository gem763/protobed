Dani Ceballos listens back, laughs, then looks down a little bashfully. \u201cSurprising,\u201d he calls it. Arsenal fans knew he was good, or hoped so \u2013 he had come from Real Madrid, after all \u2013 but you don\u2019t leave there unless someone wants you to and few expected anything quite this good, this soon. Even he didn\u2019t. Two assists, more touches, passes and dribbles than anyone and that moment when he turned full circle, fell and still escaped with the ball obediently by his foot led to a supporters\u2019 serenade. And a Spaniard wondering if that was really his name he could hear.\n\nOh, Dani Ceballos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my first day and it was as if I\u2019d been playing in England 10 years.\u201d\n\nPer Mertesacker: \u2018I want to make an impact on young people\u2019s lives\u2019 Read more\n\nHe is back in Spain, sitting in the sunshine in Las Rozas, the national team\u2019s HQ, taking it all in. Twenty days have passed since victory over Burnley, during which time he got two reminders that it will not always be like that \u2013 at Anfield he could barely breathe and he began the north London derby on the bench \u2013 but he cannot help smiling. Me encanta, he keeps saying, in the lisping Spanish of the south: I love it.\n\n\u201cI love the city, I love the Premier League and love Arsenal,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just really, really happy to be part of this great club. I\u2019ve hardly noticed any difference in size between Real Madrid and Arsenal. And the fans are very passionate, they love the players. It\u2019s much easier to adapt because they make you feel like you\u2019ve been at the club forever. I love the way everyone\u2019s treated me. They\u2019ve put a lot of faith in me.\u201d\n\nFaith is a recurring theme, opportunity and a sense of place too. The talent has never been lacking. Born and raised, like Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, in Utrera, Ceballos\u2019s parents sold churros from a van while he played football. \u201cA small, humble town,\u201d he calls it.\n\nGrowing up, he wore a goofy grin and a swoosh shaved into his head, joined Sevilla at eight, was released at 13 and went to Betis at 17. The day of his trial match, they took him off early, having seen enough, to hide him from Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nAt 20 those two clubs returned, Real beating Barcelona to him. The move, though, has not entirely worked out. That Ceballos believes it still can is underlined by his determination to go to London on loan. Under Zinedine Zidane opportunities were few: in his first season he was on the field for 16% of Real\u2019s game time. He talked about ostracism, telling Radio Marca: \u201cThere comes a time when you see it\u2019s impossible: there were times when Kroos and Modric were injured and he\u2019d change the system to put others in.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that, had Zidane stayed, he would have left. Instead, Zidane walked out. Then, six months later, Zidane walked back in. Ceballos started one of 11 matches after the manager\u2019s return, employing a personal coach to ensure his level did not drop.\n\nThis summer Zidane made little attempt to persuade him to stay. One of the midfielder\u2019s former coaches calls his treatment an aberration. It must be hard not to agree. \u201cYou have to be realistic,\u201d Ceballos says. \u201cThe two good games I\u2019ve had so far for Arsenal I never had in two years at Madrid. I didn\u2019t play a lot but it\u2019s also true that, when I played, I didn\u2019t play as I can. That\u2019s related to confidence but you have to be self-critical.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Ceballos battles with Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a team that plays better, that presses like them,\u2019 Ceballos says. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA\n\nOn that first day at the Emirates, supporters already knew what they wanted: Dani to stay. If doubts were introduced by what came next, they are minor. Liverpool defeated Arsenal and against Tottenham Ceballos was a substitute, raising familiar questions about balance, how to include a player such as him. There\u2019s something in his style, the freedom, the touch of anarchy, that means those will always endure. But the talent remains too great to ignore. Besides, he is adapting, he says. The analysis of his own flaws is striking.\n\nLiverpool, Ceballos says, was quite a lesson. It takes him a moment to order his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like what I saw at Anfield; I haven\u2019t seen a team that plays better, that presses like them, the way the fans carry them along.\n\n\u201cThey take the air from you. You spend so much time defending and when you want to do something with the ball, when you want to breathe, they\u2019re back on top of you. They\u2019re very well-drilled.\u201d\n\nIs that something Unai Emery seeks to emulate? \u201cWe can\u2019t compare it at the moment. We\u2019re working on some similar things but J\u00fcrgen Klopp arrived at Liverpool in 2015. Unai came last season. Arsenal finished a point short of the Champions League and a small step from winning the Europa League; his arrival will be positive. In a few years Arsenal will be in the top 10 teams globally, competing for everything.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a very good, compact side and the three up front really make the difference. You can compare [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang to Cristiano [Ronaldo] when he was at Madrid in the sense that he plays close to the goal he lives for scoring. He\u2019s very important for us, fundamental. [Nicolas] P\u00e9p\u00e9 is very direct. And [Alexandre] Lacazette, for me, is the best player: he understands the game perfectly and, if he\u2019s 100%, he\u2019s going to give us so much.\n\n\u201cFitting all the players together must heat up the manager\u2019s head,\u201d Ceballos says, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think the m\u00edster repeated an XI in four games, which keeps us alert. Against Tottenham it fell to me to come from the bench and I understood my role.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Ceballos says: \u2018I try to play happy. The way to bring the best out of yourself is to enjoy what you do.\u2019 Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian\n\n\u201cEmery knows me well and wants me to show my personality, my desire to learn. I\u2019m still young. I\u2019m passionate about football. I can play as a 10 or an 8, but I feel the responsibility of leading, wanting the ball in difficult moments, not hiding, getting the team playing. That\u2019s what separates the really good players. It\u2019s about saying \u2018I\u2019m here\u2019 when the team needs you.\n\n\u201cI try to play happy. The way to bring the best out of yourself is to enjoy what you do. We\u2019re a team that wants the ball, so I feel comfortable. The second half of the season is when people will see my best.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a player who tries to get at the opposition and make the difference, that offers desequilibrio,\u201d he adds. Desequilibrio defies easy translation: it means to unbalance a game, tip the scales, and implies some undoing of tactics and formations, a breaking free from the strategic straightjacket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that at times the desire to be near the ball gets the better of me and I can lose my position,\u201d Ceballos says. \u201cI have a big margin for improvement; with experience I can. Unai clearly has faith in me: he\u2019s the one who called and told me to come to Arsenal, because I\u2019d have a prominent role and would like his idea of playing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by his work. When you have the coach\u2019s confidence it\u2019s much easier to perform. I want to repay that. We, footballers, have feelings, just like anyone else. We have our low moments and you have to be very strong mentally. I\u2019d be lying if I said otherwise \u2026\n\n\u201cKnowing the coach believes in you is 60% of it, knowing that if you make a mistake he\u2019ll back you \u2026 It\u2019s only been four weeks so it\u2019s hard to say what I really think yet, but from what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s the most competitive league in terms of quality and the physical side. It\u2019s the league with the highest standard, the biggest demands. I have to adapt.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Ceballos celebrates one of Arsenal\u2019s goals in the draw with Tottenham. \u2018I love football here, the way they live and breathe it,\u2019 he says. Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nOff the pitch, too. While Reyes lived in Cockfosters and was desperate to return to Spain, his mum accidentally telling a radio show she would live in a shack if it meant going home, Ceballos is enjoying England. \u201cJos\u00e9 was a lot more into being out the house, but I have no problem,\u201d he says. \u201cMy career\u2019s going to last maybe 15 years and, if I\u2019m happy on the pitch, if I\u2019m playing, nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nHis mum will soon join the family near London Colney. His girlfriend, in the final year of her teaching degree, is doing English classes with him. The TV is tuned to English only. \u201cIn three months I\u2019ll be able to have a conversation,\u201d he says. And the lifestyle suits. The food, too \u2013 although he admits there are a couple of hams going in his suitcase home. Even the weather.\n\nIt is easy to say in August; let us revisit that in February. Ceballos laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve been warned about the cold. But I love football here, the way they live and breathe it. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You play away and there are at least a thousand fans supporting you.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s raining or snowing. I\u2019m looking forward to playing every three days over Christmas. It\u2019s a great experience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say in a year but now I\u2019m happy. They see the game like I do; I love football like they do. They respect you and a player has to feel wanted. You applaud them and they applaud you back.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes they sing your name \u2013 even if it is your first day.", "description": "Dani Ceballos tells Sid Lowe about settling at Arsenal, why Anfield stunned him and how rain, snow and Christmas fixtures will not put him off", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d9e5c19538f9cfcb2d61d42cd2f9fbc1df0d5aa/0_98_5074_3044/master/5074.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f98d0b86b390fac576470895c5c9ffae", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
