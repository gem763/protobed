But Grisham said in a letter dated August 16 that she had \"made a final determination\" to follow through with a 30 day suspension, revoking his access to the White House until September 14.\n\nIn the letter, made public by Karem's attorney, Grisham described Karem's behavior during the Rose Garden confrontation with Sebastian Gorka as inappropriate.\n\n\"Mr. Karem's conduct, taken as a whole, was unacceptable and disruptive, and requires a response to ensure that it does not happen again,\" Grisham wrote.\n\nGrisham said she \"carefully considered a range of potential responses,\" including \"permanently revoking his hard pass, providing a written warning, and taking no action.\"\n\nUltimately, Grisham said, she determined a \"permanent revocation would be too great a punishment.\" But, she wrote, \"Taking no action, on the other hand, would be insufficient.\"\n\nKarem is the second reporter who has had his hard pass suspended by the Trump administration. Last year the White House without warning revoked the hard pass of Jim Acosta , CNN's chief White House correspondent.\n\nCNN took the White House to court. A key argument was that the White House had violated Acosta's due process rights when it revoked his access without warning. CNN ultimately won its case and the White House restored Acosta's hard pass\n\nFollowing the legal loss to Acosta, the White House set up a system which allowed for \u2014 or at least provided the appearance of \u2014 some due process. As a result, Grisham first issued a \"preliminary decision\" against Karem and allowed him to appeal it.\n\nKarem, however, rejected the notion he was afforded due process by the new system.\n\n\"It's a kangaroo court,\" Karem told CNN in August. \"It's the exact opposite of due process. 'You're guilty, want to come in here and tell us why you're not?' No, that's not due process. That's the exact opposite of due process.\"\n\nThe judge presiding over his case agreed on Tuesday.\n\nContreras wrote in his opinion that Karem had \"shown that he is likely to succeed\" on his claim that his due process rights were violated when his pass was suspended.\n\n\"The present record indicates that Grisham failed to provide fair notice of the fact that a hard pass could be suspended under these circumstances,\" Contreras explained.\n\nIn a statement, Grisham said the White House \"disagree[d] with the decision,\" arguing it \"essentially gives free reign to members of the press to engage in unprofessional, disruptive conduct at the White House.\" She added that Karem \"clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct.\"\n\n\"The press secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct,\" Grisham said.\n\nIn his decision, Contreras sympathized with the White House's \"desire to maintain a degree of control over access and decorum.\" But he said \"the conferral of White House hard passes is no mere triviality\" and \"the need for regulatory guidance is at its highest where constitutional rights are implicated.\"\n\nContreras also dinged the White House for attempting to hold Karem to a vague standard of professionalism at the Rose Garden event.\n\n\"What is deemed 'professional' behavior in the context of a state dinner may be very different from what is considered 'professional' behavior during a performance by James Brown,\" the federal judge wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department could appeal the ruling. Or it could continue to press the lawsuit in Contreras' court, but that would be a steep uphill battle.\n\nAsked if the Trump administration planned to continue its legal battle against Karem, Grisham declined to comment.", "description": "A federal judge ruled against the White House on Tuesday and ordered President Trump and press secretary Stephanie Grisham to immediately restore the press credentials of Brian Karem, a Playboy columnist and CNN political analyst.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy", "Katelyn Polantz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190827153957-brian-karem-courtroom-sketch-super-tease.jpg"}
