INVEST IN A FLOOR PLAN\n\nWhile any structural change costs significant time and money, Darren said rearranging your floor plan may be worth it in the long run.\n\nHe advised requesting a quote from Hi Pages, an online network that connects householders with relevant tradespeople.\n\n'Getting a fixed price and a clear contract around a defined scope of work allows you the best chance to fit your works within a budget, though it's always wise to keep 10 to 20 percent of your budget aside for contingencies,' he told Domain.\n\nIf your budget is particularly tight - namely $10,000 or less - try moving furniture around to maximise existing space.\n\nInvesting in a floor plan can inspire fresh ideas on how to use existing space (stock image)\n\n2. SWITCH TO SOLAR\n\nDarren suggested switching from traditional energy sources to solar panels to save big on your electricity bill.\n\nThe price of solar system installation has dropped significantly in Australia since 2014, according to Solar Choice.\n\nThe key to getting to the most out of a residential solar system is to use as much direct energy as possible to avoid purchasing energy from the grid.\n\nMore than two million Australian homes now use solar power.\n\nWhat are Darren Palmer's top interior trends for spring 2019? Cobalt blue: According to Darren, 'bright, intense, acid colours' will have their moment in the sartorial sun this season. Jewel-hued shades like striking cobalt blue and emerald green are hugely popular for spring, as well as rich, chocolate brown. Darren advises choosing 'grey-based chocolate' or walnut tones to contrast with statement gemstone pieces. 1980s curves: 'Whether it's a side table or a dining table, we're seeing the 1980s influence the forms of furniture coming into spring,' Darren told Domain. 'Think about those dreadful '80s archways, then turn them on their side..and you'll get the gist of the latest forms in furniture.' Curves will be seen on tables, lamp stands, cabinets and chairs alike. Woven rattan: Darren says woven rattan and cane are 'great fits' for spring, especially contrasted with bright pops of colour - like the aforementioned cobalt and emerald - and rustic stone. Woven wicker chairs are a nice throwback to the 1960s and look well in bohemian themed abodes. Cane can also be a stylish addition to contemporary living spaces when paired with clean, straight lines and black colour schemes. Cane remains a popular choice among furniture makers because of its sustainability and resistance to mositure, The Savvy Heart reports. Recycled furniture: Darren says recycling old trinkets is a key trend for the season ahead. The hashtag 'recycled furniture' generates a staggering 46,396 results on Instagram, and includes quirky alcohol bottle lamps and vintage style vanities.\n\n3. INSTALL SKYLIGHTS\n\nDarren suggested installing Velux skylights to increase natural light without the expense of knocking walls and fitting new windows.\n\nWhile installation fees can be significant, Darren said there are ways to cut costs if you're willing to dabble in a bit of DIY.\n\n'If you're willing and able to repaint your ceiling and skylight void yourself, you should be able to achieve a dramatic change to any room for under $10,000,' he said.\n\nBathe your home in natural light by installing Velux skylights, a cost effective alternative to knocking walls and fitting new windows\n\nDecorating with ready made drapery and soft furnishings creates a luxury look for less\n\n4. BUY READY-MADE DECOR\n\nThe finishing touches of a home renovation are often the most expensive.\n\nBut Darren said there's no need to blow the budget on accessories if you're up for some bargain hunting and a little DIY.\n\n'Look at drapery that's ready made to bring down the luxury price tag,' Darren advised.\n\nHe also suggested shopping during sale season to get the best bang for your buck.", "description": "Australian interior designer Darren Palmer shared tips on refreshing your home on a budget, including buying ready made curtains and installing skylights.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19862710-0-image-a-18_1571355005626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
