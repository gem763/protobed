The bug doesn't give an attacker the ability gain administrative access to IOS itself.\n\n\"Under no circumstance could an exploitation allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the IOS software running on an affected device,\" Cisco notes.\n\nThe bug is due to an incorrect role-based access control (RBAC) evaluation for controlling access to the guest OS in IOS.\n\nAn attacker would need to be authenticated to exploit the bug. However, due to the RBAC issue, the bug allows a low-privilege user to request access to a guest OS \u2013 such as Linux instance running on a VM within an affected device \u2013 that should be restricted to administrative accounts. These are defined in IOS as 'level 15' accounts. An attacker can exploit the bug to gain access to the OS as root user.\n\nThere are no workarounds, so customers will need to ensure they're running a fixed version of IOS. However, if an upgrade can't be done immediately, Cisco suggests that disabling the guest OS \"eliminates the attack vector\" and so may be a suitable mitigation. Cisco offers instructions for uninstalling guest OS in its advisory.\n\nCisco has also published an informational advisory for an issue in the Layer 2 network traceroute utility in IOS and IOS XE. The feature is enabled by default on Cisco Catalyst switches. The company notes it is aware of public exploit code available for this issue.\n\nBy design, Cisco notes, the L2 traceroute server doesn't require authentication and allows an attacker to collect a whole lot of information about an affected device, including the hostname, hardware model, configured interfaces and IP addresses, VLAN database, MAC address table, Layer 2 filtering table, and Cisco Discovery Protocol neighbor information.\n\n\"Reading this information from multiple switches in the network could allow an attacker to build a complete L2 topology map of that network,\" Cisco warns.\n\nCisco has provided information about how to secure the L2 traceroute server in the advisory. The advice includes, among other things, disabling the server or upgrading to a version of IOS or IOS XE that has it disabled by default.\n\nHowever, upgrading to a version with it disabled won't be possible until later this year. These versions include Cisco IOS 15.2(7)E1 December 2019, and later; Cisco IOS XE 3.11.1E December 2019, and later; and Cisco IOS XE 17.2.1 March 2020, and later.\n\nIn the meantime, there are also options to restrict access through control-plane policing or access control lists.\n\nThe semiannual IOS and IOS XE bundle only includes critical and high-severity updates. In addition to the informational update, Cisco has also released 17 more advisories concerning medium severity bugs affecting IOS and IOS XE.\n\nMore on Cisco and networking security", "description": "Cisco is also telling customers to disable an L2 traceroute feature in IOS for which public exploit code exists.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/20/41920d63-4557-4af0-95b6-1f7b31624804/thumbnail/770x578/79096055b07a78f633f5f029640eb9bd/share-fb-google1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
