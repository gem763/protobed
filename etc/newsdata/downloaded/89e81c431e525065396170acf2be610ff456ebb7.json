About 14% of Argentina\u2019s planted soya is in the north of the country, where deforestation has laid waste to huge areas of the Gran Chaco forest.\n\nArgentinian officials have confirmed to the Guardian that there is no traceability system for soya from deforested areas, which appears to be mixed with soya from other parts of the country before being sold on to the UK and other parts of the world. Pablo Cortese, from Senasa, Argentina\u2019s equivalent of the US Food and Drug Administration, said there was no demand from buyers for traceability: \u201cIf the big grain traders demanded it, the same way that citrus fruit buyers demand it, Argentina would have no choice but to comply. It\u2019s the buyer who imposes traceability always.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian visited the Gran Chaco and saw bulldozers at work. Huge soya plantations stretched between small leftover islands of forest. A zoning system put in place by the Argentinian government a few years ago does not appear to have slowed the rapid deforestation, as seen in the satellite images produced by Global Forest Watch.\n\nRise of the 'wonder bean': from deforestation to your plate | Bibi van der Zee, Anna Gross, Uki Go\u00f1i Read more\n\nThe local grain wholesalers buy soy from different farmers and regions and mix it in the same silos before they sell it to the larger grain trading companies. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to trace soya in Argentina,\u201d Cortese told the Guardian. \u201cSo it\u2019s impossible to say, \u2018This particular grain of soya came from this particular farm.\u2019\u201d The soy is then shipped out of private grain-exporting terminals in Argentina\u2019s Rosario and San Lorenzo ports, with a significant amount coming to the UK. UK farms using feed that includes this soya supply a number of supermarkets, including Tesco, M&S, Asda and Morrisons.\n\nOther producers and retailers are also likely to find Argentinian soya in their supply chain. The figures vary, because soya is traded under different classifications (soybeans, soymeal, oilcake) but according to MIT\u2019s data about 55% of the UK\u2019s soybean meal comes from Argentina.\n\nUK retailers agree that there is a problem with soya traceability. Tesco said it has a detailed plan to eliminate deforested soya from its supply chain by 2025. Marks & Spencer agreed that Argentinian soya is in the company\u2019s supply chain: it is working towards a 2020 goal of zero deforestation, and refers to the work of the Retailers\u2019 Soy Group and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya.\n\nAsda is working towards sustainable soya sourcing by 2020 for its own-brand meat, fish and dairy products. It is also looking into its entire supply chain, with the aim of sourcing 100% responsible soya by 2025 for its primary protein range, including fresh meat, fish and milk. Morrisons did not respond to Guardian queries. (Full statements can be found here.)\n\nBut the problem is so extensive that many scientists and campaigners question whether voluntary initiatives will solve the problem. Soya is one of the global commodities most closely associated with deforestation, along with palm oil, beef, timber and paper, and it is the second largest driver of deforestation, according to WWF.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Smoke from a fresh forest clearance in Gran Chaco, northern Argentina.

Recent science has revealed just how critical a role forests will play if the world is to have any hope of slowing climate change.\n\nSo far most attention has been fixed on the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the Cerrado forests in Brazil. The Chaco, which sprawls across Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, has largely gone beneath the radar. \u201cBoth the Cerrado and the Chaco have been given pitifully little attention to date compared with the Amazon, yet both biomes are more imperilled. In recent years the Cerrado has risen in prominence in great part because of a greater level of research and NGO attention in Brazil \u2026 By contrast the Chaco is mostly in Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, countries that have received a tiny fraction of the research and surveillance of Brazil,\u201d said Toby Gardner of Trase.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deforestation and soya in the Chaco forest in Salta province, Argentina. Photograph: Nicol\u00e1s Villalobos/Greenpeace\n\nArgentina far outstrips the UK\u2019s and Europe\u2019s other suppliers when it comes to soya bean meal, the processed soya that is fed to farm animals. The UK imports 55% of its soya bean meal from Argentina, Italy imports 80%, and Spain 74%, according to MIT\u2019s Observatory for Economic Complexity. Europe as a whole imports about half of its processed soya bean from Argentina alone. The country is also the world\u2019s leading soya bean meal exporter, responsible for 40% of the planet\u2019s total soya bean meal trade.\n\nSoy destruction in Argentina leads straight to our dinner plates Read more\n\nIn the UK \u2013 one of a number of signatories to the Amsterdam declaration on deforestation \u2013 retailers and NGOs have been leading the call for solutions. A meeting in March 2018 brought together 60 representatives from companies like Tesco and Cargill, and led to the formation of the Roundtable on Sustainable Soya, which is investigating ways to achieve a mass-market move to sustainable soya.\n\nSome NGOs, investors and consumer groups have called for an extension of the \u201cAmazon soya moratorium\u201d to other biomes in South America, including the Gran Chaco. The same people argue that the moratorium needs to be extended because in its current form it has simply pushed deforestation to other regions \u2013 like the Chaco.\n\nOne possible route in Europe and the UK would be new regulations that require all companies of a certain size to file an annual report on the work they\u2019ve done to clear deforestation \u2013 and other issues \u2013 from their supply chains. France already has a similar law, put in place in 2017. ClientEarth, the Forest Coalition and the Greener UK coalition have been leading calls for such a requirement to be included in the current environment law. ClientEarth is also among a number of organisations pushing the EU to look at similar regulation to fulfil the aims set by the deforestation communication published in July.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nadeem Badshah and John Siddle\n\nRise of the \u2018wonder bean\u2019: from deforestation to your plate\n\nHome to the screaming hairy armadillo: the forest the world forgot", "description": "Exclusive: UK supermarkets admit there may be soya-led deforestation in their supply chains due to problems with traceability", "authors": ["Uki Go\u00f1i", "Bibi Van Der Zee", "Anna Sophie Gross"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/397981415f7025b1bf036919bc67dac40590b630/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=178b86726027b524dd2fdaef30e43ba6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
