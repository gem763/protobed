Pictured is Apple's preview of the new software, dubbed iOS 12, on its website prior to launch\n\nHOW TO INSTALL iOS 12 To install iOS 12, you must have a device running its predecessor, iOS 11. Once the update is available, head to your settings. Tap tap General, and then Software Update on your Apple device. You will need a WiFi connection and have to be connected to a charger if your battery is lower than 50 per cent.\n\nIn addition to iOS 12, Apple's latest Mac operating system, Mojave, is also now available, along with watchOS 5, the latest software for the Apple Watch, and tvOS for the Apple TV.\n\nOne of the first things you realise about iOS 12 is that, well, nothing has really changed.\n\nThere are some new apps such as Screen Time, a boost to Animoji and lots of smaller tweaks, but nothing major - and this is a really, really good thing.\n\nWhat iOS 12 lacks in jaw dropping new features, it has in general stability and boosts to everything from battery life to app launching speeds.\n\nIt really is noticeable to the average users, and your phone feels rather like you've hit to turbo button at first.\n\nOn four-year-old smartphone models, like the iPhone 6, the software is expected to increase the speed of some operations by 70 per cent - but I found even on my iPhone X there was a very noticeable difference.\n\nThe new iOS 12, which has been available to beta users and developers since Apple's WWDC event in June, promises to pack a slew of improvements for iPhones and iPads from iOS 11\n\nOne of the new features that has garnered a lot of attention is Screen Time, which records how many hours you spend using your device.\n\nAs a self confessed iPhone (and iPad) addict, it's both incredibly useful and pretty terrifying - although the setting can be a little confusing at first.\n\nBut for those concerned about their own usage or that of their kids, its a great weapon in the fight against addiction.\n\niOS 12 has a new Screen Time feature that tells users exactly how much time they're using their device. It also comes with AR Kit 2, an updated version of Apple's AR platform for developers\n\nHOW TO USE APPLE'S SCREEN TIME FEATURE Screen Time is a setting, and does not have its own dedicated to app. To use the feature in iOS 12, head to the Settings menu on your device. Scroll down to the new 'Screen Time' section. The tool is buried among your settings for Notifications and Sounds. Tap on Screen Time to see your device statistics. You can see how often you pick up your iOS device, which apps you're using, which apps are sending the most notifications, and other details. You can toggle the statistics between the last 24 hours and the last seven days.\n\nScreen Time reveals the total number of hours spent on all your Apple devices, as well as a breakdown of the number of times you've picked up your handset.\n\nThe App Limits feature allows you to set a specific amount of time to be in an app, and a notification will display when a time limit is about to expire - although sadly Apple doesn't offer any recommendations.\n\nParents can access their child\u2019s Activity Report right from their own iOS devices to understand where their child spends their time and can manage and set App Limits for them.\n\nAnother major annoyance for many users has been the sheer number of notifications you recieve, and iOS 12 helps dramatically by grouping them together, and letting you easily tweak the settings for each app.\n\nSiri has also got a big boost, and there's a new Shortcuts app letting users customise their commands, which could be a huge boost boost once apps are updated to use it, as you'll be able to use Siri to ask questions like 'how is my commute looking' using CityMapper, for instance.\n\nIt also comes with AR Kit 2, an upgraded version of Apple's augmented reality platform for developers, that includes the ability to measure the size of real-world objects.\n\nHaving recently moved apartment, I found using the new Measure tool very useful, along with Ikea's great AR app.\n\nAlso included is a revamped Photos app which uses AI to find photos you'll like in new 'moments', new Animoji characters, and doznes of other small tweaks.\n\nApple's bookreading app, now called Apple Books, has also received an overhaul, adding a really useful recommendations section, and a dedicated Audiobooks tab for the first time.\n\nOverall, there's no real killer feature in iOS 12, but that's not a bad thing - as pretty much everything is better.\n\nThis is one of the very few updates that really does improve things across the board - and make it an essential upgrade.\n\nTo download the latest operating system update, head to Settings, then tap on General and Software Update.\n\nWHAT IS NEW IN APPLE'S iOS 12? Once Apple users upgrade to iOS 12 they will see a host of changes to how their device works. It will power the iPhone and iPad and packs a slew of new features aimed at improving your device's performance, as well as fun augmented reality tools.

Apple also announced a new AR app called 'Measure' that lets you see the dimensions of objects, like photos or chairs, and get automatic measurements Photos Apple's Photos app has seen a significant upgrade in order to allow the feature to become smarter. In iOS 12, the Photos app will now display search suggestions when a user is looking for a specific picture, based on things that appear in the photo, including cars, dogs and flowers. There's also a new 'For You' tab, that shows memories, as well as sharing suggestions. It suggests that you share photos with a friend if they appear in a photo and then prompts the friend to share photos with you if you appear in their photos. Apple has added a 'For You' tab to the Photos app that will show memories, as well as produce sharing suggestions. It will suggest you share photos with other users Siri Apple has rolled out a new feature in iOS12 called Shortcuts, which adds 'quick actions' for any app. For example, a user can change their settings so that if they say 'I lost my keys', it will prompt Siri to pull up the Tile app and show you where your keys are. Another new tool is called Suggestions, where Siri prompts the user to take certain actions in iOS, such as order their favorite coffee that they drink every morning.
