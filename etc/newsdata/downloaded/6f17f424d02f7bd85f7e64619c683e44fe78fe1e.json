Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who represent the Democratic Party\u2019s more progressive wing, draw more frequent comparisons than any other 2020 primary candidates. News outlets have doggedly documented the two candidates\u2019 subtle differences and, as Warren has climbed in opinion polls, have implied that her rise has come at Sanders\u2019 expense.\n\nBut the Sanders campaign does not see it that way. His aides argue that they are competing more heavily to win over voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden, rather than Warren or any other candidate.\n\nBiden, the Sanders campaign believes, attracts the older working-class voters \u2015 of all races \u2015 with whom Sanders eventually gained traction in the 2016 election cycle.\n\n\u201cBernie appeals to younger working-class voters. Biden appeals to older working-class voters,\u201d Ben Tulchin, the Sanders\u2019 campaign\u2019s chief pollster, told HuffPost. \u201cThe latter are some of the same voters Bernie won over last time. Our view is that we can win them back again, especially talking about his core economic message.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Bernie talks about a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt political system, that really resonates,\u201d he added.\n\nJIM WATSON/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), right, sees older, working-class voters backing former Vice President Joe Biden, left, as ripe for persuasion.\n\nIn keeping with this approach, the Sanders campaign\u2019s text messaging program has a specific response for voters who say they are supporting Biden. It also has a response for voters who say they are backing Sanders, but only a general response for cases where they say they are supporting any other candidate.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, which claims to have sent 30 million text messages to voters, shared with HuffPost a text message that a volunteer sent a Nevada voter who said they were deciding between Sanders and Biden.\n\n\u201cThanks for letting me know!\u201d the volunteer replied. \u201cDid you know that Joe Biden told a room full of Wall Street billionaire donors that \u2018nothing would fundamentally change\u2019 if he became president? I\u2019m for Bernie because he DOES think we need major change.\u201d\n\nThat pitch seemed to work. The voter eventually said they\u2019d be backing Sanders.\n\nBiden did indeed tell a room full of wealthy donors that \u201cnothing will fundamentally change\u201d for them at a June fundraiser. His campaign maintains that Biden\u2019s full remarks show he was saying that wealthy people would not need to give up their standard of living in order to enact policies that lift up all Americans.\n\nBernie Sanders Campaign Sanders' campaign has developed a specific text-message response for voters who say they're considering voting for Biden.\n\nWhether one considers the volunteer\u2019s texting appeal fair or not, it is a taste of the kind of contrast Sanders hopes to draw with Biden, who has deployed populist rhetoric about bridging the income gap but has often supported business-friendly policies and courted the party\u2019s donor class over the course of four and a half decades in politics. (Neither Sanders nor Warren use private fundraisers to solicit big donations.)\n\nTrade is an area where Sanders believes he has a significant advantage over Biden with older working-class voters, particularly in industrial states like Iowa, a caucus state that hosts the first contest of the presidential primary on Feb. 3.\n\nSanders voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, which cost the United States blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Biden supported both. Sanders also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the now-defunct trade agreement that Biden promoted in his capacity as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. Exit polling suggests that drawing a contrast with Hillary Clinton\u2019s pro-free-trade record helped Sanders pull off a pivotal upset in the Michigan primary in March 2016.\n\nThe campaign also sees Sanders\u2019 plans to reduce the high cost of prescription drugs \u2014 which even voters on Medicare struggle to pay \u2014 and his long-standing support for expanding Social Security benefits as key selling points for older working-class voters.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s main messages though, is that he\u2019s the most electable candidate. He can win against Trump, he says, in part because he\u2019s more moderate than Sanders and Warren. But Tulchin said voters concerned about electability tend to skew more educated and affluent, which are not the primary targets of Sanders\u2019 class-centric message anyway.\n\n\u201cThe more upscale you go, the less well Bernie does,\u201d he said.\n\nTulchin emphasized that though Sanders believes he can win over some of the white working-class voters who voted for Obama in 2012 and subsequently switched to Trump, the campaign believes his message has appeal with working-class Black and Latino voters as well. The campaign is optimistic about Sanders\u2019 chances in Nevada, where the disproportionately working-class Latino population makes up a large share of the electorate. (An average of public polls in the state nonetheless shows Sanders tied for second place with Warren.)\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Some supporters of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are not considering voting for Sanders.\n\nTulchin told HuffPost that public polling data so far supports the campaign\u2019s view that Biden voters have a similar socioeconomic profile to Sanders voters.\n\nIn a national poll conducted by Monmouth University in late August, Sanders came in first place among Democratic voters without a four-year college degree, with 24% support. He was followed by Biden, who had 18%, and Warren, who had 17%. In the same survey, Biden and Sanders both had similarly high favorability ratings among both college-educated and non-college-educated voters, while Warren had a favorability rating with college-educated Democrats that was 20 percentage points higher than among those without a degree. (Sen. Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg enjoyed a favorability edge among college-educated voters at least as large as Warren\u2019s.)\n\nIn addition, Morning Consult\u2019s national poll in late August shows that Biden supporters would pick Sanders as their second choice and vice versa.\n\nBut the public opinion research is vast enough that other polls offer contradictory data. For example, a late August poll released by Quinnipiac University found that Sanders trails Biden among Democrats earning less than $50,000 a year, and lags behind both Biden and Warren among white voters without a college degree. And a Pew Research Center poll from mid-August found that more Biden voters would pick Warren or Harris as their second choice than would pick Sanders.\n\nNeither the Biden campaign nor the Warren campaign responded to a request for comment for this story.\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, HuffPost interviewed 35 voters at three Sanders rallies in New Hampshire and Maine; a Warren rally in New Hampshire; and a Labor Day breakfast in Maine hosted by local labor unions.\n\nThere was plenty of affinity for Biden \u2015 and Warren \u2015 amongst the Sanders supporters.\n\nOf the 15 Sanders supporters with whom HuffPost spoke, voters cited Biden as their second choice just as frequently as they named Warren. (Some, though, were unwilling countenance a Sanders loss. Others named other second-choice candidates.)\n\nHis message is pretty much what the labor movement was, which is: power to the people, band together, take down corporations \u2014 or at least keep them in check. Wayne McAllister, Iron Workers Local 7\n\nWayne McAllister, 30, who came to see Sanders in Raymond, New Hampshire, on Sunday with his wife Ryann, 24, volunteered for conservative Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the 2016 election cycle. He got turned onto Sanders\u2019 message \u2015 and progressive politics more broadly \u2015 after joining the Iron Workers Local 7 union, which endorsed Sanders in 2016.\n\n\u201cHis message is pretty much what the labor movement was, which is: power to the people, band together, take down corporations \u2015 or at least keep them in check to make sure they don\u2019t hold too many of the cards, that the worker still has a voice, that the worker still has a say in the matter of what happens,\u201d McAllister said.\n\nAnd Biden would be his second choice, McAllister said, because he\u2019s \u201cone of the elder statesmen, been around for a while.\u201d\n\nJoe Piccone, who works for Teamsters union Local 340 in Maine and attended the Labor Day breakfast in Portland, Maine, said he was backing Sanders because Sanders is a \u201cpro-labor guy.\u201d\n\nBiden is the only other person who Piccone said he feels confident would also fight for unions.\n\nBiden \u201chas a track record with labor that I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d Piccone said. \u201cThat\u2019s not being critical of Elizabeth Warren \u2015 that\u2019s saying I\u2019m going with a known entity.\u201d\n\nBut in a clear example of why the Sanders campaign isn\u2019t focusing on Warren supporters, just one of the 10 voters who told HuffPost they\u2019re backing the Massachusetts senator said Sanders was their second choice.\n\nLisa Wenger, a public school teacher who came to see Warren speak in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Monday and said that Warren\u2019s speech won her over, considers Sanders \u201ctoo far left.\u201d\n\nAsked what she makes of people who liken Warren to Sanders, Wenger said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a bunch of meshugas.\u201d", "description": "Although he's closest to Warren ideologically, Sanders believes voters who back Biden are the most persuadable.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d711e81240000fb1775f62e.jpeg?cache=wgoycvvdia&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
