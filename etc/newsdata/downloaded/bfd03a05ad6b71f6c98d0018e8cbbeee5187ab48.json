I want it to be real and I don\u2019t want it to be co-dependent or messy or lack of communication.\n\n\u2018I think, you know when you get older, you find people who are actually right for you, that are actually on the same wavelength.\u2019\n\nHer interview comes while Selena is promoting her new track, Lose You To Love Me \u2013 yup, the one that caused a bit of a stir as it\u2019s thought to be about her ex Justin.\n\nShe sings about being \u2018replaced\u2019 in two months \u2018like it was easy\u2019 while also shading this ex for \u2018singing off-key\u2019 in her chorus, but hasn\u2019t actually confirmed which of her exes inspired the song.\n\nSelena revealed she wrote the song \u2018over a year ago\u2019 because she \u2018needed\u2019 to share her story and keep her music authentic.\n\nOf course, fans were quick to speculate the links to Bieber and things only escalated when Hailey was accused of hitting back at Selena by posting a screenshot of the song I\u2019ll Kill You by Summer Walker on her Instagram story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, Hailey has insisted the two were definitely not related and she\u2019s not here for all the drama.\n\nIn screenshots published by JustJared, Hailey denied the the accusation in a since-deleted comment online that read: \u2018Please stop with this nonsense\u2026 there is no \u2018response,\u2019 this is complete BS.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
