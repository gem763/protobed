The ad will run predominantly on Fox News, including the network\u2019s morning show, Fox & Friends, of which the president is a religious viewer.\n\n\u201cMitch is afraid to cross Donald Trump,\u201d the spot goes. \u201cJust look at what happened to Mitt Romney. So will Mitch defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic? Or protect Trump at all costs?\u201d\n\nThe notion that McConnell would bend his position on impeachment to the advertising whims of a group financed by Democratic presidential candidate and liberal donor Tom Steyer is, inherently, far-fetched. But the new spot doesn\u2019t appear to be an effort to move McConnell towards supporting impeachment so much as an attempt to solidify a narrative that the majority leader has to make a choice between protecting the Republican Senate\u2019s majority and standing by the president.\n\n\u201cI do think it is important to point out how scared to death McConnell is of Donald Trump,\u201d said Kevin Mack, the chief strategist on Need to Impeach. \u201cIt seems like he is willing to sacrifice his own members to not incur the wrath of Trump.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the cable-news buys, Mack said that Need to Impeach will also run preliminary digital ads in Kentucky to test out messaging among voters there. Two other ads will begin to run on Kentucky television soon, he said.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
