BHP and TESA are seeking about $1 million each.\n\nThe class actions were filed in June last year and allege that the labour hire firms engaged workers as casuals rather than permanent employees at BHP's Mount Arthur coal mine to avoid paying award entitlements. BHP is named as an accessory.\n\nThe law firm has also launched similar class actions against labour hire firms Chandler McLeod's Ready Workforce, Workpac, Hays and Stellar Recruitment worth an estimated $150 million.", "description": "A recent wave of class actions against employers over alleged underpayments has been dealt a blow with a ruling exposing litigation funders to costs if they lose.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.592%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_91%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ba197570e570fa4cb5eace732b59f26b08b7dc8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
