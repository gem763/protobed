We\u2019re in her new studio in Sydney\u2019s Rushcutters Bay \u2013 after years of sharing commercial premises in town with her mother, Carla Zampatti, Spender moved in January. The new digs are a bijou jewel with harbour glimpses, i.e. tiny, but she\u2019s delighted to be crammed in here with her small team.\n\nShe proffers a dog-eared copy of The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last week identifying birds for the boys.\u201d Sons Dominic and Florian are 7 and 10. \u201cIt occurred to us that birds are very fashion. I mean, look at cockatoos with their punk yellow hair.\u201d\n\nLike a bird, she flies between topics. Although she says she wants to slow down, the Bianca Spender I know is often in a hurry. I once went to the theatre with her and afterwards we walked to the train together. As she zoomed off up the street, I had to jog. I rack my brains trying to think which bird she\u2019s most like. Then it hits me. Of course. She is a rare bird.\n\n\u201cThe craft of making clothes, the fashion business, cutting, sewing \u2013 that\u2019s my heritage\u201d: Bianca Spender. James Brickwood\n\nIn May, just days before Australian Fashion Week, Spender presented her 10th anniversary collection not on a runway but at her home in Bronte, to a hand-picked list of 80 interesting women \u2013 not 450 bloggers, buyers and journalists, which she\u2019d done the year before. Glossy-magazine editors mingled with creatives Spender has worked with over the years and who have become close friends: sculptor Anna-Wili Highfield, curator Nina Miall, filmmaker Jasmin Tarasin.\n\nAs the models walked through the crowd, Spender described her creative process, white skin gleaming in the darkness, hand-talking (she\u2019s half Italian) in her one-shouldered black dress. She mentioned the naive art movement and Depression-era craft \u2013 juxtaposed make-do-and-mend with the sophistication of couture techniques \u2013 and explained how these things had inspired the collection. She talked about how important it is for clothes to move with the body. Linking the women in the room with the women who make her clothes, she riffed on her respect for them all.\n\nThe point of the evening was not to drum up press or even capture the activity. \u201cThink of a dinner party with amazing conversations. Do you take photos? No. It will be embedded in your memory, because you were present. When I did the collab with Raf, he told me: \u2018The dance only rests in the body of the dancers and the people who watched it.\u2019 It\u2019s ephemeral.\u201d\n\nRaf is Rafael Bonachela, artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company. Spender worked with him on Cinco, which premiered in April. She designed costumes for the second of this production\u2019s three acts, using wisps of lemon yellow georgette. She wore some herself to take her bow with the company when the curtain closed.\n\nSpender has \u201ca genuine love for and understanding of the arts\u201d, says Bonachela. \u201cShe clothed the dancers in fluid twists and falls to match their physical grace. I knew that Bianca\u2019s refined aesthetic could embody the spirit of the work.\u201d\n\nI was at Cinco\u2019s opening night with a coterie of Spenderites, clad in her tuxedo jackets and devor\u00e9 dresses.
