REUTERS/Stringer\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output or more than 5% of global supply, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the assault was the work of Iran, a Houthi ally.\n\nThe drone strikes on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum processing facility, were expected to send oil prices up $5-10 per barrel on Monday as tensions rise in the Middle East.\n\nIranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation as \u201cpointless\u201d. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\n\u201cAll American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometres around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest share sale.\n\nAramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days\u201d.\n\nAnother source briefed on the developments said Saudi oil exports would continue to run as normal this week thanks to large storage in the kingdom.\n\nBut it remains unclear how long the oil production shut down will continue, because the damage to the infrastructure \u201cwas big\u201d and could not be fixed overnight, the source added.\n\nTraders and analysts said crude may spike to as high as $100 if Riyadh fails to quickly bring back supply.\n\nThe kingdom, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day.\n\nRiyadh said it would compensate for the loss by drawing on its stocks which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The United States said it was also ready to tap emergency oil reserves if needed.\n\nThe Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is the nerve centre of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,\u201d Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cUNPRECEDENTED ATTACK\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. government information, 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage on their west-northwest facing sides.\n\nPompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2019ite Muslim rival Iran.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks.\n\nKuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. The cabinet said the prime minister ordered tighter security at vital installations.\n\nRiyadh accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies. It has not yet blamed any party for Saturday\u2019s strike, but linked it to a recent series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters.\n\nRiyadh says Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny.\n\nRegional tensions have escalated since Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday\u2019s attacks and called on all parties to exercises restraint and prevent any escalation.\n\nThe European Union warned that the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, Britain called them a \u201creckless attempt\u201d to disrupt global oil supplies and France said such actions could only worsen \u201crisk of conflict\u201d. Iran\u2019s ally Turkey called for the avoidance of \u201cprovocative steps\u201d.\n\nU.S.-IRAN TALKS\n\nThe attack comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a possible meeting between the two but told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the strikes \u201cdid not help\u201d that prospect.\n\nSaudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that Riyadh was ready to deal with \u201cterrorist aggression\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group\u2019s military sites in Yemen.\n\nThe conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The alliance has air supremacy but has come under scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has left millions facing starvation. The Houthis, more adept at guerrilla warfare, have increased attacks on Saudi cities, thwarting peace efforts.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, Riyadh\u2019s main partner in the alliance, has reduced its presence in Yemen due to concern over rising Iran tensions and Western criticism of the war, leaving Riyadh to try to neutralise the Houthi threat along its border.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Washington and its allies were \u201cstuck in Yemen\u201d and that blaming Tehran \u201cwon\u2019t end the disaster\u201d.", "description": "Iran rejected accusations by the United States that it was behind attacks on Saudi oil plants that risk disrupting world energy supplies and warned on Sunday that U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in the region were in range of its missiles.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430063750&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E06R", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
