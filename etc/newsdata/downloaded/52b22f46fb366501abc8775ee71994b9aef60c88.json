Bleach and ammonia produce a toxic gas called chloramine. It causes the same symptoms as bleach and vinegar (burning eyes, coughing) - along with shortness of breath and chest pain. Many glass and window cleaners contain ammonia, so never mix those with bleach. To clean shower grout correctly it's best to mix 3/4 cup household chlorine bleach with 3.5 litres of water. Wearing rubber gloves and eye protection, use a stiff brush to apply the formula to one small area at a time. Be careful not to let the liquid spatter onto surrounding surfaces. Let it sit for several minutes, then scrub and rinse.
