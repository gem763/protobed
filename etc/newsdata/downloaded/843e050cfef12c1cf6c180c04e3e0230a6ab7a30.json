Its centrality to climate research could be calculated in many ways, including the steady stream of climate-related science it has continued to produce. The agency puts out an annual Global Climate Report, and told the public just a few weeks ago that this July was the hottest on record.\n\nThat work continued long after the Environmental Protection Agency took down the climate page on its website \u201cto reflect E.P.A.\u2019s priorities under the leadership of President Trump.\u201d It continued after the United States Geological Survey was instructed to stop projecting the impact of climate change after 2040, when the most severe impacts are expected. It continued after the head of the Climate and Health Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention filed a whistle blower complaint that alleged retaliation for speaking out on climate change.\n\nNOAA\u2019s independence is partly structural, according to current and former staff members and outside experts. Unlike the E.P.A. and many other agencies, NOAA isn\u2019t primarily a regulatory agency (the regulations it does handle mainly concern fisheries). That means there are few businesses with a financial stake in weakening the agency or limiting its authority.\n\nCulture matters, too. NOAA\u2019s scientists, and the career staff members who oversee them, have a reputation for fiercely guarding the agency\u2019s independence. They seem to feel they\u2019ve been successful. Last year, the Union of Concerned Scientists asked more than 63,000 scientists at 16 federal agencies to gauge their perceived independence; of the scientists at NOAA who responded, two-thirds agreed with the statement that the agency \u201cadheres to its scientific integrity policy.\u201d\n\nFor most of the time Mr. Trump has been president, in other words, NOAA has flown under the radar.\n\nThat changed during the past 10 days, as the agency\u2019s skill at avoiding the political spotlight was eclipsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to admit that he was wrong, coupled with the lengths to which his White House proved willing to go to reset the record.", "description": "Also this week, how to get a tax break for installing solar panels", "authors": ["Christopher Flavelle", "Susan Shain"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/climate/11cli-newsletter-noaa/11cli-newsletter-noaa-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
