They have been highly embarrassed by Mr Nicklinson's case, because he has sought to change the law on murder - to allow a doctor to kill him legally - rather than their own attempts to amend the Suicide Act, which makes it illegal to assist someone to kill themselves.\n\n\n\nNo respite: The High Court has rejected Tony Nicklinson's appeal for a doctor to be allowed to help him take his life\n\nCharlie Falconer's sponsors at Dignity in Dying, the former Voluntary Euthanasia Society, have been busy distancing themselves from Mr Nicklinson in recent weeks. His case is notable by its absence on their website, relegated to its outer reaches. Its chief executive, the hapless Sarah Wootton, performed the polemical equivalent of the party game Twister yesterday, expressing sympathy for Mr Nicklinson but claiming that he didn't represent what she wants.\n\n\n\nThe problem for her and 'Proper' Charlie Falconer - so dubbed because he was caught out at Westminster chairing a supposedly independent 'Commission' which was in fact packed with and bankrolled by euthanasia supporters - is that Mr Nicklinson's case precisely and entirely raises the same issues that attach to what they coyly call 'assisted dying'.\n\n\n\nThe High Court judges yesterday were refreshingly right to rule that a change in the law was a matter for Parliament, not the courts. This could be seen as something of a side-swipe at Falconer's campaign, because it was Dignity in Dying which disgracefully exploited Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy and lobbied the Law Lords (as they then were) in 2009 to have the law on assisted suicide 'clarified' by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to establish under what circumstances a person would not be prosecuted for assisting a suicide. This was no more nor less than an attenuation of Parliament.\n\nSetback: The High Court ruling is a blow to former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer\n\nListening to yesterday's radio phone-ins, with their underdeveloped 'surely-the-law-must-change' themes, you could be forgiven for assuming that the legislature had been negligent in ignoring this issue. In fact, Parliament has scrutinised the introduction of 'assisted dying' thoroughly on four occasions over less than the past decade and voted against its introduction twice, for reasons of protecting the vulnerable and ruling against any state-sanctioned disposal of human lives as worthless or second rate.\n\n\n\nMr Nicklinson's High Court ruling has re-focussed attention on those issues and the recent record of their treatment by Parliament. That's very bad news indeed for Falconer and his euthanasia co-conspirators.\n\n\n\nBecause, far from being an entirely separate case in law from the 'assisted dying' campaign, as Miss Wootton so feebly claims, Mr Nicklinson's desire to have the state dispose of him when he wishes precisely raises the same objections that have knocked down Dignity in Dying's previous applications to Parliament.\n\n\n\nSome of these questions are as follows: Who would do the mortal deed? Doctors, presumably. That raises the most profound ethical issues and compromises the medical profession in a manner that has never been attempted in its history, by introducing killing as a medical treatment.\n\n\n\nCan the state effectively sanction such killing? If it does so, we have written into our law the objective confirmation that some lives are 'useless' and not worth living. Some people may subjectively (and, indeed, temporarily) arrive at that decision about their own lives, but it is entirely different and infinitely more dangerous for the state to sanction that eugenic view.\n\n\n\nCan reasonable safeguards be introduced to ensure that a voluntary-euthanasia law isn't abused and that the most vulnerable aren't coerced into taking their own lives? The evidence from foreign jurisdictions that have introduced such laws is far from encouraging. But, anyway, who would regulate it? The same people who have regulated the banks, or the newspapers, or MPs so effectively? And, remember, we're dealing with matters of life and death here, not just money (though money may well be the single greatest motivating factor in these matters of life and death).\n\n\n\nShould we have the 'right' to be helped to die? No, of course not. Suicide was rightly de-criminalised in the Suicide Act of 1961, but there is an entirely different moral burden attached to helping someone else to kill themselves. We've grown accustomed to the consumerist imperatives of individual 'choice', but to relate that to human life is to confuse freedom with personal autonomy. The latter can only be extended so far as it doesn't act detrimentally on the lives of others.\n\n\n\nHeavy price: Mr Nicklinson has at least prompted us to consider the dangers of allowing assisted dying\n\nAll these questions and more have been examined in Parliament, Falconer's lobby repeatedly has been found wanting in its alternative answers to them and euthanasia has consistently been thrown out. It will be again when it is brought back by a ginger group that won't take 'No' for an answer.\n\n\n\nPoor Mr Nicklinson, who continues to pay such a heavy price for a civilised society that refuses to kill its vulnerable and despairing, has unwittingly focussed our attention on the paucity of the cases for euthanasia espoused by Falconer and his chorus at Dignity in Dying.\n\n", "description": "GEORGE PITCHER: Yesterday's High Court judgment is first and foremost a terrible blow for Tony Nicklinson, who is paralysed from the neck down after a stroke and can communicate only by blinking.", "authors": ["Rev George Pitcher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/17/article-2189830-1381FCAE000005DC-182_1024x615_large.jpg", "published_at": "2012-08-17"}
