The Iraqi government says the toll was higher.\n\nThe shooting deepened the resentment of Americans in Iraq four years after US forces toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and raised questions about the expanded use of armed contract guards by the US government.\n\nSlatten was originally sentenced in 2015 to life in prison as the alleged first person to have opened fire.\n\nThe three others were given 30 year prison sentences, although Lamberth at the time of sentencing said that: \"It's clear these fine young men just panicked.\"\n\nAn appeals court, accepting later evidence that another guard was the first to fire, overturned Slatten's guilty verdict and ordered a new trial for him alone.\n\nHe faced one charge of first degree murder of a single Iraqi, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed al Rubia'y.\n\nA spokesperson for the court said federal prosecutors were reviewing the case. They can choose to ask for a new trial, or decide not to pursue it further.", "description": "The second murder trial of a former Blackwater security guard over the 2007 killing of a civilian in Baghdad was ruled a mistrial Wednesday, a year after his first conviction was thrown out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3651/f481a577611249f2b8bfa732e35c052b.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-06"}
