His \u201ccharacter is not in issue,\u201d the motion filed in court on Thursday says.\n\nInstead, \u201cwhat is in issue is specific conduct\u201d on the night in September of 2018 when he says he had consensual rough sex with his classmate, who had been seeing a friend of his. She says she came out of a blackout covered with bruises, and we do know that her injuries were documented by the nurses who did a rape exam the next day.\n\nThe texts he sent that night would seem to be very much be at issue. At a preliminary hearing, Lawrence Police Detective Charles Cottengim testified about those messages.\n\nDefense attorney Branden Bell asked, \u201cDo you recall him stating his preference or his intent to sleep with (his friend\u2019s sometime girlfriend) that night?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cottengim said, \u201cthere were messages.\u201d\n\n\u201cImmediately after he talks about how f\u2013ed up she is?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd saying how he\u2019s going to do it just to show (his friend) that he can?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIf found guilty of making a false report at a trial scheduled to start on Oct. 28, she could spend almost six years behind bars.\n\nProsecutors also want a gag order placed on her and her defense attorneys.\n\nThe motion, filed by Chief Assistant District Attorney Eve Kemple, said this is because \u201cthe state has a right to a fair trial.\u201d\n\nBut so does the accused, Counselor. And the problem with your arguments in this motion, as with the case as a whole, is that you can\u2019t prove she was lying without proving she wasn\u2019t raped, and you can\u2019t prove she wasn\u2019t raped without investigating whether she was raped. This would seem to entail a look into the background of the man whom Cottengim testified police took at his word that he had done nothing wrong.\n\nThe Lawrence police by their own admission never investigated the woman\u2019s report. Instead, they looked at her cellphone, saw texts she had written minimizing the situation while she was still in it - and still under the influence - and concluded on the spot that she was lying. They only interviewed the man who she says raped her as part of their investigation against her.\n\nIn a statement, her defense attorneys said, \u201cOur client has a right to respond to allegations that the prosecutor has publicly aired, including the accusation that she fabricated the allegation of rape.\u201d The jury should get to see the \u201che said\u201d as well as the \u201cshe said\u201d before they decide who is and is not lying.\n\n_____\n\nThe Lawrence Journal-World, Oct. 13\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s rules on student-athlete pay aren\u2019t the real problem\n\nSome great basketball minds, including University of Kansas coach Bill Self, have come out in support of the California law that eventually will allow student-athletes to be paid for endorsement deals and other such marketing work.\n\nA prime argument that Self and others have made is summed up in this recent quote from Self: \u201cI think it\u2019s been long overdue to give student-athletes the same opportunities that general students possess.\u201d\n\nGiven that, here is an interesting question for Self: Should KU basketball players be allowed to bet on the games they play in? After all, other students can do so. NCAA rules, though, prohibit student athletes from betting on any collegiate or professional sport because to do otherwise would invite corruption.\n\nThat\u2019s also the argument for why the NCAA doesn\u2019t allow student-athletes to be paid for endorsement deals or any other work that derives from \u201cthe publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\u201d\n\nWhat is to stop a rabid booster from sending word to a top recruit that the booster\u2019s business will pay the recruit $100,000 a year to appear in his business\u2019s ads if he comes to KU.\n\nIs that what we want college athletics to be about? Fans of schools with rabid, rich boosters maybe do. But it is easy to see why the NCAA - and lots of smaller schools that just want to provide reasonable extracurricular athletic activities - don\u2019t want to see college sports become even more about who has the richest, most rabid boosters.\n\nThere are valid reasons why the NCAA can and should ban players from being paid for their athletic talents. The NCAA shouldn\u2019t be forced to run a system that invites corruption.\n\nHere are some other questions for those who support the California law and are eager to lambaste the NCAA:\n\n. Why aren\u2019t you mad at the NBA? So many people are labeling the NCAA as a dictatorship because it won\u2019t allow a student-athlete to sign an endorsement deal. But how is that worse than the NBA saying you can\u2019t play in its league unless you are at least 19 years old? When you are 18 years old you are an adult and can get drafted and die for this country. But you can\u2019t play in the NBA. Consider this: The average length of an NBA career is just under five years. By delaying the start of that career by a year, the league is lopping off 20% of the average player\u2019s career. Talk about a cruel dictatorship. The NFL is just as bad, or worse, but since this is Lawrence, we\u2019ll focus on basketball.\n\n. How is this different from the choices other college students must make? Say you are a very talented science student. You get a chance to intern at one of the college\u2019s research labs on very exciting work. If you take the internship, though, you can\u2019t also work at a private lab doing the same research work. The university prohibits it because it creates too much disruption. You have to make a choice. Uber basketball talent Zion Williamson had to make a choice. He could have gone overseas and made big money until he turned 19. Instead, he played for \u201cfree\u201d at Duke. Why? Maybe because playing overseas wouldn\u2019t allow him to gain a legion of Duke fans that he could take with him to the endorsement deal he signed as soon as he ended his college career. If the NCAA is offering such a bad deal, why do so many people take it?\n\n. Do you know that even student-athletes can have an outside job? The NCAA doesn\u2019t prohibit student athletes from getting paid to work while in school. If you are willing to toil away in anonymity in the stock room of a department store and get paid the going rate, that is permissible under NCAA rules. It happens all the time at smaller schools and smaller sports. It doesn\u2019t happen often in big-time programs, though. But it is not the NCAA that prohibits it. Rather, it usually is an unwritten rule from the coach. If you have free time, you spend it getting better at your sport, not at some side job. To do otherwise means you are not a team player, in the eyes of coaches and rabid fans.\n\nToo bad California - and everybody else who is concerned about the exploitation of student-athletes - didn\u2019t pass a law that will change that.\n\n______\n\nThe Topeka Capital-Journal, Oct 13\n\nOpen carry of beer at Kansas State Fair worth consideration.\n\nEarlier this month, the Kansas State Fair board decided to take a big step: Pursuing open carry of beer on the grounds of the fair.\n\nRight now, those who attend the yearly celebration of all things Kansas can only consume their malted beverages in such confined areas as beer gardens. Based on his recent experiences, State Fair general manager Robin Jennison is looking to change things up.\n\n\u201cI went to the Iowa State Fair where they can carry alcohol openly up there, and it makes for a great event,\u201d he said, according to the Hutchinson News\u2019 John Green.\n\nThere are complications to making the move. Current state law prohibits consumption of alcohol on public property without an exception. The exception held by the state fair allows beer only in the aforementioned confined areas.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward decision for legislators this coming session, and it makes sense for them to have a healthy debate and then move the policy forward.\n\nJennison addressed the two biggest concerns about the change head on, and his answers made good sense. First off, worries about people walking around drunk are misplaced, he said. If anything, confining beer consumption to tents encourages fairgoers to pound down drinks. Allowing them to wander and nurse a beer could actually reduce inebriation.\n\nSecondly, the family atmosphere of the fair would be enhanced rather than reduced. Why? Parents wouldn\u2019t be trying to cram in time to spend in the beer tent. They could simply get a drink and then enjoy the entire fair with their families.\n\nAs with any policy change, we might expect that a handful of people attempt to bend these rules, take advantage of them, or otherwise make a nuisance of themselves. Fair security - and those serving alcoholic beverages - should be ready to tackle these challenges head on, or any policy change would be a short-lived one.\n\nThere were also concerns voiced at the fair board meeting about alcohol being present at youth events, and about who would get the opportunity to sell. These are worthwhile concerns, and ones that draft legislation - and the Legislature itself - can address.\n\nBut ultimately, Jennison\u2019s arguments make a great deal of sense. The experiences of Iowa and other state fairs that do the same (including ones in Oklahoma, Texas and Florida) suggest that fairs and fairgoers benefit.\n\nThe board is right to pursue the change, and legislators should give the proposal a full and fair hearing next year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Kansas City Star, Oct. 14", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
