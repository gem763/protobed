(And possibly out of the country entirely.) The response has been rapid and generally brutal across the board. Has any of this sunk in with the President yet, potentially leading him to reconsider this decision? As of last night, it certainly didn\u2019t sound like it. (Associated Press)\n\n\u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he wrote, adding that, \u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d He said it will now be up to the region to decide what to do with captured IS fighters, and warned of retribution in response to any future attacks. \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d he wrote. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened for months to launch the military operation across the Syrian border. He views the Kurdish forces as a threat to his country. Republicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and send a troubling message to American allies across the globe.\n\nBut at the same time that the tweetstorm was brewing, US News reported that an anonymous \u201csenior administration official\u201d said America is \u201cnot removing its forces from Syria in the face of a Turkish incursion.\u201d The official went on to say that Trump had simply ordered approximately fifty special forces troops to relocate to \u201ca different part of the country.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s sort of a distinction without a difference, isn\u2019t it? If the expected Turkish assault is only going to move fewer than twenty miles into Syrian territory (as Erdogan intimated) and we\u2019re pulling our troops to the south, that\u2019s still \u201cremoving our forces\u201d from the expected field of battle. Still, this apparent contradiction in the messaging makes me wonder if an extra night to sleep on it has the President reconsidering the plan.\n\nI have no doubt that President Trump isn\u2019t losing any sleep over the Washington Post\u2019s comments about his \u201cstunning ignorance\u201d of the situation in Syria. He probably takes it as a badge of honor. But some of the other people weighing in must surely carry a bit more weight with him.\n\nTwo of the louder voices in Washington who are opposing this policy shift are Lindsay Graham and Cocaine Mitch. I\u2019m not suggesting that Trump takes his marching orders directly from them (or anyone, for that matter) but he\u2019s surely aware that if the Democrats move forward with impeachment, those will be two people he needs leading his defense in the Senate trial to follow. And they\u2019re hardly alone. Elected officials and conservative media figures across the board are freaking out at this point, moreso than they have been over most any other controversial decision coming out of this White House.\n\nThe President is describing this as yet another campaign promise he\u2019s keeping. Fair enough, but it\u2019s not being done intelligently. Trump\u2019s constant goal since taking office has been to keep his base revved up and solidly behind him. But those Republicans screaming most loudly about the abandonment of the Kurds were elected by that base. What few defenses of this decision I\u2019ve seen thus far have been luke-warm and watered down at best.\n\nIf Erdogan\u2019s forces come blasting into the border region this week and begin slaughtering the Kurds wholesale, the disaster will land squarely on the plate of Donald Trump and nobody else. And starting yet another trade war with Turkey in response isn\u2019t going to solve anything. They\u2019re already a marginal \u201cally\u201d at best and such a move will simply push them further into Vladamir Putin\u2019s arms all the faster. There is no good outcome from this scenario that I can see and the President needs to find a path to back away from this move even if he loses face in the process. Sadly, that seems totally out of character for him so I\u2019m not hopeful at all.", "description": "And if not, why not?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trump-marine1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
