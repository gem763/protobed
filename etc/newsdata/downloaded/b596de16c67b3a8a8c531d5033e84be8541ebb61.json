If this punishment had been allowed to stand, it would have only made it more difficult. Today's decision reaffirms that students have the right to freedom of speech, and that they do not check their rights at the schoolhouse gate,\" said Alison Beyea, executive director at the ACLU of Maine.\n\nHer mother, Shael Morris, said she and her daughter were \"thrilled\" by the judge's decision.\n\n\"All my daughter ever wanted was for students to feel safe speaking out about sexual assault. I'm so proud of her for standing up for what she believes in,\" Morris said in a statement.\n\nCape Elizabeth High School administrators suspended Mansmann for three days for bullying, saying the note led to an individual staying home from school for eight days out of concerns for his safety.\n\nIn his ruling, Walker said he was sympathetic to school administrators' concerns but suggested they shouldn't have \"carte blanch\" to tamp down students' concerns about social justice.\n\n\"Contemporary examples abound of betrayal of free speech principles to avoid ideas or speakers with whom we disagree. Madison would recoil. Individual liberty is both the cause and the result of personal fortitude,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo other students also were suspended for their actions but they haven't come forward. It's unclear if they accepted their punishments.\n\nAfter Mansmann's note was posted, the rumor mill spun out of control, creating fear in the high school a few miles from Portland.\n\nIn the end, the high school conducted 47 interviews, and Principal Jeffrey Shedd said the school was safe. He said previously the three who were suspended meant well but \"made a really bad choice.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
