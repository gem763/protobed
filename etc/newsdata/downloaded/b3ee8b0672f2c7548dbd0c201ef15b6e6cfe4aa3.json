A Scottish court agreed, ruling last week that the five-week suspension was an \u201cegregious\u201d overreach, designed not as a brief pause between parliamentary sessions, as is customary, but to foil the legislature\u2019s ability to shape Brexit plans.\n\nAn English court, however, dismissed a related case, determining that the issue was a political matter and not one for courts to decide.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing both cases on appeal.\n\n[Boris Johnson booed by protesters, berated by prime minister in Luxembourg]\n\nWhich way will the high court lean? The court proceedings \u2014 to be streamed live over three days \u2014 could have far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The proceedings could also drag into play the role of the queen. And they could impact the direction of Brexit.\n\nDozens of protesters gathered outside of the court, holding aloft placards that read \u201cDon\u2019t Silence our MPs\u201d and \u201cThey Misled the Queen.\u201d\n\nReflecting that significance, the formally out-of-session Supreme Court has been summoned for an emergency hearing, and the number of judges has been increased from the usual five or seven to 11. A total of 12 judges sit on the court, but they hear cases in odd numbers to avoid ties.\n\nThe English case is expected to be up first. That one was filed by Gina Miller, a business executive and anti-Brexit activist. Miller and her legal team won a similarly momentous 2017 case in which the high court ruled the government must get Parliament\u2019s approval before \u201cinvoking Article 50\u201d and starting the countdown to Brexit.\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller is appealing a case dismissed by a London court earlier this month. (Will Oliver/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nWriting in the Independent newspaper on Monday, Miller argued that the current case: \u201cis so much more important even than Brexit. It is about how we are governed, about preserving our ancient democratic freedoms and trying at all costs to stop a dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nMiller charged Johnson with wanting to \u201cput himself above the law\u201d and suggested that if he\u2019s allowed to have his way, future prime ministers could bring back the poll tax or reintroduce the death penalty without any input from lawmakers.\n\n[Europeans once hoped the British would reverse Brexit. Now, many can\u2019t wait for them to leave.]\n\nJohnson, in an interview with the BBC on Monday, disparaged \u201call this mumbo jumbo about how Parliament is being deprived the opportunity to scrutinize Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a load of claptrap,\u201d he said, arguing that the suspension was necessary to \u201cset our ambitious agenda for the country\u201d and that Parliament had only lost \u201cfour or five days\u201d compared to its typical schedule in late September and October.\n\nJohnson has denied a further contention of the Scottish court: that his government was misleading about its motivations for the suspension, including perhaps to the monarch.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the prime minister responded last week to a reporter who asked if he had lied to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe queen must approve any parliamentary suspension, but by custom she must abide by the advice of her prime minister.\n\nParliament was shut down in the wee hours of Sept. 10, following chaotic scenes on the floor of the House of Commons. It is scheduled to remain shuttered until Oct. 14, unless the court rules against Johnson and orders lawmakers back sooner.\n\nBritain\u2019s Supreme Court is nowhere near as interventionist as the Supreme Court in the United States. But this case is testing the boundaries of the executive and where the courts can weigh in.\n\n\u201cThis is really Constitutional Law 101,\u201d said Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law at Cambridge University. \u201cFirst year constitutional law students coming in don\u2019t need to read textbooks, they just need to read Twitter.\u201d\n\nBritain doesn\u2019t have a written constitution. It relies on the rule of law, precedent and convention. And Johnson is a convention-busting prime minister.\n\n[\u2018The Trumpization of U.K. politics\u2019: Boris Johnson is busting political norms]\n\nBarnard said that those in the government\u2019s corner will argue that the case should stay \u201cin the political domain \u2026 and it means the courts aren\u2019t caught up in political controversy.\u201d\n\nThose in the opposing corner will argue that \u201csurely no government power should be unlimited,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight almost to the death between the executive and the legislature,\u201d said Jo Maugham, a lawyer and one of the driving forces in the Scotland case brought by 78 lawmakers.\n\nMaugham voiced fears about another possible suspension shortly after Parliament returns on Oct. 14. In theory, he said, Johnson could suspend Parliament for the entire term and \u201cgovern untrammeled by the legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prorogation is unusual, so we are seeing unusual litigation flowing from it,\u201d said Raphael Hogarth, a scholar with the Institute for Government think tank. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable: Once nobody feels like they know the rules of the game in Westminster anymore they will start turning to the courts.\u201d\n\nJohnson has defended the independence of British judges, saying the judiciary is \u201cone of the great glories of our constitution \u2014 they are independent.\u201d\n\nHe has also said he will abide by the law. But in the next breath he hints that he may not.\n\nAlthough Parliament passed a law demanding that he request a Brexit delay if a withdrawal deal hasn\u2019t been agreed by the middle of October, Johnson insists he will not seek any further delays.\n\n\u201cWe will obey the law,\u201d he told the BBC on Monday. \u201cBut we will come out \u2014 and \u2014 we will come out, I should say, on 31 October.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nFormer prime minister Cameron says Boris Johnson acted \u2018appallingly,\u2019 misled voters on Brexit\n\nBoris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess.
