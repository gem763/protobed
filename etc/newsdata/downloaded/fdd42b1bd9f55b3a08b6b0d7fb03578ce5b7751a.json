The firm sought to quash the investigation by arguing that the CFPB was unconstitutional.\n\nIn urging the Supreme Court to take the firm\u2019s appeal, Mr. Francisco cites a dissenting opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, written in January 2018 when he sat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nWhile the majority opinion, by Judge Cornelia Pillard, found the CFPB similar to the FTC and other agencies Congress has sought to shield from political interference, then-Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent argued there was a critical difference: the Dodd-Frank law vested control of the bureau to a single director rather than a multi-member commission like the one upheld in Humphrey\u2019s Executor.\n\n\u201cMulti-member independent agencies do not concentrate all power in one unaccountable individual, but instead divide and disperse power across multiple commissioners or board members. The multi-member structure thereby reduces the risk of arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power, and helps protect individual liberty,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department said the court need not eliminate the CFPB but rather strike Dodd-Frank provisions preventing the president from firing the director at will.\n\nIf the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, it may appoint an outside lawyer to argue the position abandoned by the Justice Department\u2014that the director\u2019s independence is constitutional.\n\nThe CFPB was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who as a Harvard law professor argued that a consumer-focused enforcement agency could help prevent financial-industry excesses. Republican opposition dissuaded President Obama from naming Ms. Warren the agency\u2019s first director, prompting her successful run against Republican Sen. Scott Brown in 2012.\n\nSen. Warren, now a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "description": "Critics argue the CFPB\u2019s design interferes with the president\u2019s constitutional power over the executive branch.", "authors": ["Jess Bravin", "Jess.Bravin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108089/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
