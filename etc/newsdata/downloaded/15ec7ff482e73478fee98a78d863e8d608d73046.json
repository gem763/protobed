Are you sort of diminishing their plight by suggesting that?'\n\nMr Littleproud denied he was trivialising the issue, saying 'totally not, Hamish'.\n\n'I actually live and breathe it every day, my friend. I actually see these people, and I know them by face and by name.\n\n'These are resilient people. And they believe in what they do, and they know what they are doing is the best in the world.'\n\nThe federal government has been accused of not doing enough to help farmers, despite offering hundreds of millions in aid.\n\nMr Littlerpoud defended his government's policies and said farmers had reason to hope.\n\nMr Littleproud denied he was trivialising the issue, saying 'totally not, Hamish'. Pictured: Hamish Macdonald\n\n'Now, we are going through a tough time, and we've continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we've faced up to them and we've continued to work through them,' he said.\n\n'When people say they want hope, it is about leadership of hope and saying we will get through this.\n\n'Your government will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this, and we will get you through.'\n\nIt comes after Alan Jones furiously rowed with Scott Morrison about drought relief for farmers in an explosive interview on Tuesday morning, sparking loyal voters to turn on the PM.\n\nIn one particularly heated moment, the radio host interrupted Mr Morrison and bluntly told him: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nAfter the interview Jones was overrun with calls from listeners, many of whom voted Liberal, as they lined up to slam the Prime Minster, calling him 'arrogant' and a 'waste of space'.\n\nA fired-up Jones was urging the PM to do more to help farmers who cannot afford feed and water to keep livestock alive.\n\nAlan Jones furiously rowed with Scott Morrison (pictured) about drought relief for farmers in an explosive interview on Tuesday morning, sparking loyal voters to turn on the PM\n\n'These people, Prime Minister, cannot survive today,' Jones said angrily.\n\n'They are sending the breeding stock to the sale yard to be slaughtered, they're walking off their farms.\n\n'They need cash now. Now. Just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami.'\n\nMr Morrison explained that he couldn't make it rain and that $318million has already helped in the past year.\n\n'The direct cash grant support is going into farming communities, including directly to farmers,' Mr Morrison said.\n\nHow does that feed a cow? Jones repeatedly asked the PM\n\nBut Jones interrupted, saying: 'They're not getting it!'\n\nMr Morrison continued: 'Alan, if you could let me finish. There's $318.5 million...'\n\n'I don't know where the money is Prime Minister,' Jones interjected.\n\nAs Mr Morrison tried to make his point, Jones cut in with a blunt remark: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nMr Morrison continued trying to explain how aid has helped while a frustrated Jones kept interjecting and asking: 'How does that feed a cow?'\n\nJones then criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000.\n\n'You say Farm Household Allowance. Now PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on $250 a week,' Jones said.\n\n'It's not $250 a week Alan. It's not just that,' Mr Morrison replied.\n\nJones (pictured) angrily interrupted the PM several times during the interview\n\n'If you live in the city, and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart. But if you are on a farm property and you get access to the Farm Household Allowance.'\n\nJones did not accept his answer and pressed the PM further by asking: 'Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter?'\n\n'Because of the drought, that's why,' said the PM.\n\nMr Morrison then admitted he couldn't save farmers from some hardship.\n\n'The government, whether it's state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to try and help people get through this. But the government can't make it rain, and it can't make life as it was before the drought,' he said.\n\n'We both want the same thing. We want the farmers to be able to get through this drought. But we can't kid ourselves that there's a magic wand and a magic cash splash that's going to make this thing totally solved.'\n\nAt times during the interview, Jones became exasperated as he repeatedly interrupted the Prime Minister and sighed and tutted when Mr Morrison spoke.\n\nDespite Jones' combative stance, 2GB listeners said they were disappointed by the Prime Minister.\n\nOne named Robert said: 'My blood's boiling after hearing that. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He's arrogant. They've been conning the public after the election.'\n\nAnother named Michelle added: 'I'm a dairy farmer's daughter. That interview should sign the end of his Prime Ministership. Just absolutely diabolical.'\n\nOne listener named Chris said: 'Today we've nailed him to a post. He's a failure.'\n\nSome of the 2GB listeners said they had voted for Mr Morrison in the election in May, bringing him victory against the odds for which he credited 'quiet Australians'.\n\nHe was referring to rural, regional and older Australians who go about their business without making a fuss or sharing their opinions before polling day.", "description": "David Littleproud appeared to take a swipe at broadcaster Alan Jones who angrily clashed with Scott Morrison over the issue on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816202-0-image-a-13_1571274168243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
