Congress \u2014 in a fit of rare bipartisanship \u2014 meanwhile, warns of doom and mayhem if the United States vacates the region, leaving our longtime allies the Kurds to certain annihilation by the Turks and others.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, issued a Twitter message Wednesday saying: \u201cNews from Syria is sickening. Turkish troops preparing to invade Syria from the north, Russia-backed forces from the south, ISIS fighters attacking Raqqa. Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAnyone wishing for the return of the \u201cgood ole days\u201d when our system of checks and balances were kept robust by regular fights among the three branches of the federal government \u2014 regardless of party control \u2014 should be thrilled by these developments.\n\nIt is true that Mr. Trump won the 2016 election on a blatant non-interventionist \u2014 bordering on isolationist \u2014 foreign policy platform, at least when it comes to military force. This position \u2014 long popular among Democratic voters \u2014 has become increasingly popular among Republican voters as they grew frustrated with the seemingly never-ending, costly commitments overseas. (It is ironic, indeed, that politicians in Congress are unified in favor of such a conflict just as regular voters of both parties are unified against them.)\n\nIn a Twitter message of his own, Mr. Trump declared: \u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East.\u201d And, in a tone ripe for one of his campaign mega-rallies, he added: \u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d\n\nIt is also true that the Kurds have been valuable allies in not only Syria but also elsewhere throughout our nearly two-decade military campaign through the Middle East. And, to be sure, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to desert the Kurds will undoubtedly lead to the death of many Kurds, including innocent civilians, women and children. Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria will almost certainly weaken the civilized world\u2019s campaign against radical Islamic terrorism and embolden those who wish to destroy the civilized world.\n\nDespite Ms. Cheney\u2019s understandable hand-wringing over the regrettable situation with the Kurds in Syria, she and her suddenly unified fellow legislators in Congress hold the answer to this constitutional standoff. And it is a fairly simple solution.\n\nIf Congress is so adamant that U.S. forces should be fighting in the Syrian civil war, then Congress should vote to declare war.\n\nAs it stands today, U.S. forces are deployed in Syria on legally and constitutionally shaky grounds. In the days after the 9/11 terrorists attacks, Congress approved an Authorization of Use of Military force, which allowed the president to deploy troops against those responsible for 9/11, as well as any \u201cassociated forces.\u201d\n\nIn the two decades since, presidents have used this authorization as a shortcut to avoid going through Congress to get approval for military action abroad. As a result, the United States today is engaged in 80 countries across six continents fighting terrorism. And, as evidenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and 2016 victory, voters are tired of it.\n\nOddly, members of Congress such as Ms. Cheney who are urging President Trump to remain in Syria are essentially committing constitutional suicide by working to eliminate their own authority in the process of sending troops into battle overseas. That is a self-defeating motive that even the Founders could not imagine.\n\nAnd who knows? Having the debate on the floor of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate just might persuade American voters to turn in favor of such foreign military adventurism. Regardless, such a declaration of war would surely give President Trump all the cover he needs to keep the United States entangled in Syria\u2019s civil war and fighting alongside the Kurds.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
