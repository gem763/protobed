Picture: Wilbert Bijzitter/EPA/AAP\n\nHe said that before the young man told him the story and asked for help, he ordered and drank five beers.\n\n\u201cHe was very confused,\u201d Chris Westerbeek told the broadcaster.\n\n\u201cYou could see he had no idea where he was or what he was doing. He said he had run away and that he urgently needed help.\n\n\u201cHe said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm. He said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old told the publican he had never been to school and that he escaped at night because it \u201cwas not possible during the day\u201d.\n\nWhen police attended, they arrested the 58-year-old man. Police said he was uncooperative.\n\n\u201cWe found six people living in a small space in the house which could be locked, not a cellar,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if they resided there voluntarily. They say they are a family, a father and five children.\u201d\n\nDe Telegraaf describes Josef B as \u201ca strange figure, not very talkative\u201d.\n\nA neighbor of the woodworking company where Mr B works told the newspaper he was \u201cextremely friendly but difficult to reach, with a large bundle of hair and a thick beard.\n\n\u201cI took packages for him, tools and the like, but I found it annoying that I could reach him so badly by telephone.\u201d\n\nLocal mayor Roger De Groot said it was believed the children\u2019s mother had died.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know their mother died before they arrived there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPolice found makeshift living quarters where the family was living in hiding. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Chris Westerbeek talks to local reporters about the young man who walked into his pub after nine years inside an isolated farmhouse.

The police are investigating all possible scenarios.\n\n\u201cThe family is in a safe place. They need rest.\u201d\n\nMore to come.\n\nOriginally published as Family locked in secret room for 9 years", "description": "The mysterious father figure who lived with five adult children in a hidden farm basement has been named after one of the kids escaped.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f52324a49b3a74c88e7e3bbd5496eb3d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
