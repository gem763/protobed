Mariah and Ashley were home alone from school and watching television with their dog, when a tree suddenly crashed through the roof of their family home last Thursday.\n\n\u201cEverything fell on top of us, between the tree and insulation and the ceiling,\u201d said Ashley.\n\nCourtesy Jenn Stone\n\nCourtesy Jenn Stone\n\nA tree outside their home had completely uprooted from the ground and fell directly on the Stone\u2019s home.\n\nA video captured on the family\u2019s Ring security camera in their living room shows the terrifying moment that the tree came crashing through their home.
