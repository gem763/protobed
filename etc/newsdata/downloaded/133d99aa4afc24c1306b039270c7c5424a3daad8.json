If you were hoping for less noise in in the markets following a lazy long weekend, you'll likely be disappointed.", "description": "Perhaps the biggest event to affect expectations for the S&P .09/03/2019 19:37:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Political", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
