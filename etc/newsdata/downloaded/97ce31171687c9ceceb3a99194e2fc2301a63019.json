YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nDo you know the story of the four African royals exiled to a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?\n\nTo Mozambicans, Gungunhana was an anti-colonial hero in the fight for the country's independence. But after his defeat as the last emperor of Gaza, he and three other royals almost disappeared from the history books as they were exiled to Terceira, where they spend the rest of their lives without ever seeing their African homeland again.\n\nWATCH: I walked inside this ancient, extinct volcano\n\nThe Town Hall of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nForgotten Royalty is a new documentary that highlights this lost history, directed by Zimbabwean filmmaker Mosco Kamwendo. The film recently made its premier in Terceira, accompanying an intergovernmental and academic conference that focused on their lives on the island and their time spent imprisoned in Lisbon.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re African, you always get to a point where you want to question the world around you - you want to understand why I am the person that I am.\u201d\n\nLanding on Terceira is a strange experience - you can drive to the other side of the island in half an hour and can walk its capital city - Angra do Hero\u00edsmo - flat in an hour. Getting there with modern technology can take some time, but in the late 19th century it must have been a harrowing journey, especially as a prisoner.\n\nALSO WATCH: A pilgrimage of memory to Robben Island\n\nIf you find yourself there, you can take a self-guided walk that follows in their footsteps. You can start at the harbour of the statue of Vasco da Gama, where they first landed on the island, and take the walk up to the Fortress of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista - the prison they called home for the rest of their lives and where a plaque commemorates their existence.\n\nYou can also walk past the Cathedral of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, where their African identity was finally stripped from them in a forced baptism and their new Christian names were born.\n\nYou can see the trailer for the documentary here.\n\nThe active military section of Fortress of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista.
