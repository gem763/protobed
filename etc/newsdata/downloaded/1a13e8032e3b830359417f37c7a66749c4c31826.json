But they need to act fast.", "language": "en", "text": "Clive Mason, Getty Images It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Australia has engineered a huge upset on the global stage.\n\nLocal retailers have a huge window of opportunity right now to take the fight to e-commerce giant Amazon, former Amazon executive Jon Reily told Business Insider Australia.\n\nGiven the $30 billion e-commerce space is predicted to expand enormously over the next five years, the growing pie means it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game to win, he said.\n\nWith Amazon expected to take several more years to hit its strides in the Australian market, retailers are able to get ahead of the curve and cement outmuscle Amazon before it finds its footinghis thinking goes.\n\nWhen Amazon announced it was launching in Australia in 2017, analysts were quick to predict the end times for local retailers.\n\nTwo years on and while that hasn\u2019t happened yet, it likely will if Australian businesses don\u2019t step up their game, former Amazon executive Jon Reily told Business Insider Australia.\n\n\u201cAmazon has been dancing with Australia for two years now but Amazon Australia is a paltry site compared to its other global sites,\u201d said Reily, who was head of e-commerce user experience and design for the devices business at Amazon HQ in Seattle, Washington, from 2012 to 2015.\n\n\u201cThe country is definitely in Amazon\u2019s crosshairs but it\u2019ll take a few years yet so Australian retailers have a huge opportunity before Amazon becomes another behemoth here.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have found that it typically takes the e-commerce giant up to 7 years to cement its dominance in a new market. Having arrived in Australia at the end of 2017, that still leaves some time on the retail Doomsday clock.\n\nValued at less than $30 billion last year, Australia\u2019s e-commerce market is expected to swell in the coming years presenting a huge opportunity for both Amazon and its Australian competitors, according to Reily, currently the vice-president of global commerce strategy at consultancy Publicis Sapient in New York.\n\n\u201cAustralia is a unique case\u2026 for a country of its population and per capita income, it should have over $100 billion a year in e-commerce and yet it\u2019s not even close that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game because you have several companies dipping their toes in but e-commerce isn\u2019t widely used yet,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s partly a matter of having a small population spread so disparately around this sunburnt country, which makes it difficult for the American company to compete on price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about learning how to become efficient moving things from point A to point B. The population of Australia is roughly the same as the population of Texas so there\u2019s still not a huge push for Amazon to come here in terms of making money,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s this very problem that a recent $1 billion deal struck between Australia Post and Qantas aims to tackle, expanding the amount of freight that can be shipped around the country.\n\nThose limitations, however, have also likely kept the Amazon threat at bay thus far.\n\nPrime Day, Amazon\u2019s biggest sales event of the year is estimated to have pulled a paltry $US2 million in Australia this year \u2014 a pittance for founder and world\u2019s richest man Jeff Bezos.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s how Jeff Bezos built the $1 trillion company\n\nThat limited footprint in Australia hasn\u2019t stopped it from raising the bar.\n\n\u201cI call it the Amazonification of expectations. Even though Amazon doesn\u2019t play heavily in a market doesn\u2019t mean the expectations of customers aren\u2019t affected by that. We used to be satisfied receiving something 7 days later in the post but now we want everything delivered in 30 minutes like a pizza,\u201d Reily said.\n\n\u201cLocal retailers who can rise up and meet some of those heightened expectations ahead of time will be very successful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about getting on the front foot, Reily said, rather than having to play catch-up once Amazon is established and already swallowing up market share.\n\n\u201cWhether or not Amazon is dominant in 2025 or 2027 depends on what Australian companies do now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to take your shopping niche and be the gold standard of what is expected digitally. If you wait two to five years, you won\u2019t have the same chance and you\u2019ll be stuck defending against Amazon. You can already see companies like Bunnings and Good Guys making digital strides forward of doing things. They just have to keep upping their game.\u201d\n\nThey will likely need to survive. The latest figures show that the whole sector is under pressure as customers consistently spend less with many retailers are simply going out of business. The ability to go after an e-commerce boom, expected to grow between 15 and 20% over the next five years, may be the key to that.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the businesses themselves that will want to succeed. While increased competition is generally good for customers, a monopoly is not.\n\n\u201cJeff Bezo\u2019s vision is to be the store for everything for everyone and you can applaud the man for having a half a century vision but I don\u2019t want to buy every single thing across the planet from Amazon,\u201d Reily said.\n\nAmazon famously promises to sell everything \u201cfrom A to Z\u201d, and given Amazon.com already stocks an estimated 120 million different products \u2014 including 44 million books \u2014 it can\u2019t be too far off.\n\nBall\u2019s in your court, Australia.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
