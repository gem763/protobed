It was the high processing requirements of crypto-mining software that providing the clues that unauthorized processes were running.\n\nCyberbit researchers said that the intruders had created a variant of a known crypto-miner that allowed it to slip by computer security defenses heavily reliant on anti-virus software which rely on previously discovered signatures and models of attack.\n\nCyberbit's approach is to look for abnormal behaviors in IT systems in real-time and identify attacks that carry no easily identifiable signature or method.\n\nThe discovery of the infected international airport creates the question: how many more international airports have unknown malware?\n\nA crypto-miner stealing compute cycles from an airport IT system has potential widespread repercussions in a large region and beyond. Airport information systems could slowdown and maybe fail, creating chaos among departing and arriving passengers, and many other problems.\n\nCrypto-miners are relatively easy to detect because of their high processing requirements but most malware is small and designed to be discreet and therefore far harder to detect.\n\nIf airports have hidden crypto miners already running who knows what else has penetrated into these vital IT systems?\n\n", "description": "Here's how known malware exploits can be tweaked to get past current security systems but can't hide from behavior analysis", "authors": ["Tom Foremski"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/aafb558e-7ade-4e08-8c4d-c720bde42c8d/thumbnail/770x578/efaef79da1574fb1963ea00886838595/aftewrdark-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
