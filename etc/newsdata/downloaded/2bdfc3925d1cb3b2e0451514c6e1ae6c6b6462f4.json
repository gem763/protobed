We were too trusting and we have been burned. We are mortified.'\n\nMr Riley and support worker Miss Brennan bought their new-build three-bed semi for \u00a3130,000 in June, this year.\n\nParts of fence and other debris and rubbish were strewn across the sheeting laid down on the grass\n\nWhat was meant to be the beginning of a new fence was left in a muddy puddle after the landscaper vanished\n\nThe couple, who bought their new-build three-bed semi for \u00a3130,000 in June, sit in the remains of their back garden\n\nSince their return from holiday, the couple have tried to get in touch with Mr Hill but have had no response. Pictured: the unfinished landscaping\n\nAs part of the deal their garden was not completed and they had to do the landscaping themselves.\n\nDanny said: 'We'd had a couple of expensive quotes for \u00a38,000 and \u00a36,000 and we were looking for something cheaper.\n\n'I made an appeal on a Facebook buy and sell page to see if anybody knew somebody and this guy came forward.\n\nThe couple (pictured) say they are very upset and now don't have the money to sort out the garden\n\n'He came round to our home and he gave us a great price of \u00a34,000. He said we could pay him \u00a32,000 upfront and pay the remaining \u00a32,000 over a year.\n\n'We snapped his hand off. He was a great guy, very friendly and keen to help us.\n\n'We paid the \u00a32,000 straight away and he started the work. We filled out a form to put the remaining \u00a32,000 on finance.\n\n'But he soon came back and told us the finance had been refused. Looking back alarm bells should have started ringing at this point, especially seeing as we'd just got a mortgage, but we believed him.\n\n'He told us we would need to pay the rest of the money, so we did.'\n\nMr Hill had a couple of things crop up, which put a halt to the work, but he assured the couple he would get all the work done while they were on holiday in July.\n\n'While we were on holiday he told us he was having problems with his child,' said Mr Riley. 'He told us his son had a bleed on the brain.\n\n'We were in contact him while we were away so we did know it wasn't getting done.\n\n'But when we came back at the end of July we were absolutely gutted at the state of it. It is heartbreaking.'\n\nThe couple (pictured together outside the front of their home) have put out a warning on Facebook telling other members of the public not to trust him\n\nAn area that was meant to become decking outside the property was left bare after the builder didn't come back after taking their money\n\nThere were holes, bags of compost, plastic sheeting and gravel strewn across the garden.\n\nSince their return, they have tried to get in touch with Mr Hill but have had no response.\n\nThey have even visited his home, for the landlord there to tell them he'd moved out because he was not paying his rent.\n\n'He has also deleted his social media accounts and blocked our numbers,' said Danny.\n\n'We're very upset, we're not going to be able to get any work done now because it's winter and we don't have the money.\n\n'I'm not sure I'll trust anybody to do any work for us again. So far we have decided that we will get family involved and try and do the work ourselves.\n\n'We have put our own warning out on Facebook to not trust him and we have had a massive response from people saying they have been a victim too.'\n\nPeter Cameron Hill has been contacted on Facebook for comment and denied the offence.\n\nLancashire police have been contacted for comment.", "description": "A workman had promised to renovate Danny Riley, 26, and Lucy Brennan's, 21, outdoor space in Church, Lancashire with astroturf, decking, paving and fencing while they were away on holiday.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/14/19656188-0-image-a-59_1570974571601.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
