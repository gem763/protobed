Five people have died. (Rick Bowmer/AP)\n\nA Michigan man reportedly \u201cwent from perfectly healthy to brain dead\u201d in nine days after he contracted the rare, mosquito-borne virus Eastern equine encephalitis during an uptick in cases this year.\n\nOfficials in Kalamazoo County on Sept. 6 said a resident infected with EEE, also known as \u201csleeping sickness,\u201d had died. The family of Gregg McChesney, 64, identified him to News 8 as the victim and said he had been helping to install docks in a pond less than a month before he died on Aug. 19.\n\n\u201cHe was perfectly healthy, happy human being, and within a matter of nine days he went from perfectly healthy to brain dead,\u201d McChesney\u2019s younger brother, Mark McChesney, told News 8 on Tuesday. \u201cAll of a sudden he had a seizure, and next thing you know, he\u2019s in the ER and he just never came out of it.\u201d\n\nDoctors confirmed several days after the elder McChesney\u2019s passing that he had contracted EEE, News 8 reported. McChesney is among at least seven people who were infected with EEE in Michigan in July, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n[\u2018They feasted on him\u2019: Ants at VA nursing home bit a veteran 100 times before his death, daughter says]\n\nTwenty-one people in six states have been diagnosed with EEE this year, and five people have died, the Associated Press reported. Those counts reflect an uptick from the annual average of seven EEE-related illnesses and three deaths.\n\nMassachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island have had confirmed EEE cases in 2019, according to the AP. The deaths have occurred in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Michigan.\n\nMark Fischer, an expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the AP it was unclear why EEE cases were high this year but that the numbers typically increase once every several years. Most infections happen in the summer, the AP reported.\n\nEEE is most common in eastern and Gulf Coast states and is often transmitted in and around swampy areas, according to the CDC. People older than 50 and younger than 15 are most at risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus.\n\n[Bees swarmed a cockpit and caused a flight delay \u2014 and it\u2019s far from the first time]\n\nMost people who become sick will abruptly experience symptoms four to 10 days after a mosquito bite. Typical symptoms includes chills, fever, malaise, joint pain and muscle pain, according to the CDC. Many people who survive are left with brain dysfunction, personality disorders, seizures or other mental and physical issues.\n\nNo human vaccine or specific treatment for EEE exists. The CDC advises people to wear long sleeves and pants to prevent mosquito bites, use insect repellent, install screens on windows and doors, and empty standing pools of water to prevent mosquito breeding sites.\n\nAlthough horses are at risk for EEE infection, the CDC says infected horses are unlikely to spread the disease to people because the amount of the virus in their bloodstreams usually is not enough to pass it on to mosquitoes. An EEE vaccine exists for horses.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow a \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 Muppet became embroiled in a controversy over autism\n\n1 in 9 high school seniors vape nicotine near-daily, new survey says amid e-cigarette scare\n\nThe U.S. abortion rate falls to lowest level since Roe v.
