While some cardiologists argue that stenting should only be used in cases of moderate to severe blockage, it has historically been deployed much more widely. In 2017, after decades of doctors stenting most anyone with even moderate blockage, evidence finally emerged that the practice did not prolong life. But many cardiologists continue to do it because patients report subjective improvements in things like chest pain and shortness of breath.\n\nThe statement seems to suggest that Sanders\u2019s case of coronary artery disease is on the less severe end of the spectrum. \u201cChest discomfort\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cheart attack,\u201d and is more commonly used to describe angina, the clinical term for the pain that results when too little blood is flowing to the muscle of the heart. Recognizing and addressing angina before a serious heart attack is medically optimal, but it\u2019s much less severe than a heart attack, which means total blockage of an artery and loss of blood supply to heart muscle. Angina is the result of compromised flow, and it is reversible. A heart attack, on the other hand, can cause permanent damage.\n\nRead: Placebo effect of the heart\n\nThe fact that only one of Sanders\u2019s arteries was stented is likely meaningful, too. If multiple blood vessels are involved, the disease is usually more serious, and sometimes requires open-heart surgery for coronary-artery bypass grafts. Many people have undergone bypass surgery and continued to work for decades, including David Letterman and Bill Clinton. This is not apparently what\u2019s happening in Sanders\u2019s case, which bodes well for him.\n\nThe statement also noted that Sanders is currently \u201cconversing and in good spirits.\u201d If Sanders had suffered a major cardiac arrest and were sent to the intensive care unit, he would not be chatty.\n\nStill, the campaign said it would be canceling Sanders\u2019s public appearances until further notice. This would be expected for anyone undergoing coronary stenting. It\u2019s important for doctors to monitor the patient in the days after the procedure to assure that symptoms improve and that no complications have been introduced. But there is no reason to suspect that, if all goes as well as expected, Sanders would be unable to appear on a debate stage in 12 days\u2014and much less that he would be unable to campaign or perform the duties of the office of the president.", "description": "The senator underwent one of the most common procedures in the country.", "authors": ["James Hamblin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19275579727220/facebook.jpg?1570038754"}
