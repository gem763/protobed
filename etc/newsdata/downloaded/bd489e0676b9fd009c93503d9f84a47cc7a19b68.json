Now, a new detail is emerging in the Wall Street fable.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan recalled how Buffett initially tried to reach his company with a proposal eight years ago. The legendary investor called a public phone line and was rebuffed.\n\n\u201cHe got into the call centers and asked to speak to me and of course they don\u2019t transfer everybody who calls the call centers to the CEO\u2019s line,\u201d Moynihan said in an interview for broadcast on \u201cThe David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations.\u201d Yet the deal still came together within hours.\n\nMoynihan\u2019s version expands on Buffett\u2019s own descriptions of the wildly profitable bet he arranged for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Buffett has said he was bathing when he got the idea but that he\u2019d never called Moynihan directly before.\n\nThe day the investment was announced in August 2011, Buffett told CNBC he asked his assistant to contact Moynihan\u2019s assistant to get the CEO\u2019s private number. But according to Moynihan, it was Berkshire\u2019s finance chief who ultimately made a connection by reaching out to one of the Wall Street firm\u2019s investment bankers.\n\n\u201cAnd he basically said, \u2018Brian, I want to make an investment in your company.\u2019 And I said to him, \u2018We don\u2019t need the capital,\u2019\u201d Moynihan recalled. \u201cAnd he said \u2018I know, that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. You need stability, you need an imprimatur, and the capital will do you good.\u2019\u201d\n\nBuffett\u2019s purchase of the bank\u2019s preferred stock and warrants helped shore up confidence in the lender as it faced losses tied to subprime mortgages. As the share price quadrupled over the years, Buffett added to the stake to make it Berkshire\u2019s second-largest holding, now worth more than $26 billion.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lananh Nguyen in New York at lnguyen35@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.
