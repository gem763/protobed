Several parties are supporting increasing numbers, even as public polling shows some interest in putting tighter controls on the system.\n\nC\u2019EST LUNDI \u2014 Welcome to POLITICO Pro Canada\u2019s morning newsletter. Send news tips and song requests to lgardner@politico.com, apanetta@politico.com and cboudreau@politico.com, or on Twitter @Gardner_LM, @Alex_Panetta and @ceboudreau.\n\n\u201cYou put your thoughts into the shape of a weapon / All you did was learn a terrible lesson / That you can sell me out again / Sell me out again\u201d\n\nDIGITAL TAX IDEA LAID OUT \u2014 The Liberals say that if they\u2019re reelected, they\u2019ll introduce a tax on the largest tech companies, modeled after the one in France that has caused serious tensions with the U.S.\n\nThe promise was one of significant new details laid out in the full Liberal platform released Sunday. To date, the Liberals have avoided committing to such a tax, saying they preferred to wait for a global plan to be reached at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nHow much it would raise: The Parliamentary Budget Officer analyzed the proposal, which the Liberals say would collect C$540 million in Year 1 and $730 million in Year 4 of the next mandate.\n\nIt would be a 3 percent value-added tax on targeted advertising services and digital intermediation services. It would only apply to businesses with worldwide revenues of at least C$1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than C$40 million. That would hit the likes of Google, Facebook and Netflix \u2014 and would likely anger the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe Internet giants are making massive profits and using tax-avoidance schemes around the world to not pay their fair share,\u201d Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Sunday in announcing the policy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ensure that revenue generated in Canada by those large corporations actually does get taxed and benefits our society.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Get ready for blowback: France\u2019s plan has angered the U.S., which sees this as a de facto tariff on American products. It\u2019s drawn threats from President Donald Trump of counter-tariffs on French wine.\n\nThe countries have reached a compromise in which France would eventually refund the companies any difference between what\u2019s collected by its tax and whatever the OECD plan ends up being. Canada, like France, will keep seeking an international agreement.\n\n\u2014 Deficits, deficits: The Liberals also promise to tighten corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. They also want a new 10 percent tax on luxury cars, boats and personal aircraft worth over C$100,000.\n\nWhy the need for this new revenue? Never-ending deficits. The Liberals, who used to promise a balanced budget, now project a C$21 billion deficit in four years. That\u2019s even without the national drug-coverage plan they\u2019re promising.\n\n\u2014 Other new promises: Trudeau also promised to create a new position in the federal government, a Data Commissioner, to enforce future laws and regulations that flow from basic principles recently outlined by his government, like privacy rights and cracking down on online hate speech.\n\nThe Liberals, who are also keen to turn out the youth vote, also promised to boost Canada Student Grants by C$1,200, and pledged a C$15 federal minimum wage. [The New York Times this weekend took a look at Trudeau\u2019s struggles with holding onto this segment of the electorate.]\n\nLiberals also promised a tax cut for lower-income Canadians, which would result in 700,000 more people paying no taxes at all.\n\n\u2014 More weekend announcements: Green Party Leader Elizabeth May promised a so-called robot tax, which is aimed at raising money to retrain workers who lose their jobs to automation and artificial intelligence technology. The NDP pledged C$100 million to keep youths from joining gangs.\n\nFIRST FOR PROS: HOW CANADIANS FEEL ABOUT PHARMACARE \u2014 An exclusive POLITICO/Abacus Data poll on Canadian attitudes to prescription-drug policy carries some eye-opening nuggets and may shed new light on why the Trudeau Liberals have delayed releasing details of their plans for pharma until after the election.\n\nThe survey says only 22 percent of Canadians want the government to spend tax dollars on coverage for people who already have good insurance, while 62 percent disagree or strongly disagree.\n\nWhere it could hurt: The numbers suggest Trudeau is vulnerable to Conservatives\u2019 attack that Trudeau\u2019s reforms are a threat to Canadians\u2019 private insurance plans. Trudeau is now merely saying that he wants to ensure universal coverage, but won\u2019t commit to a single-payer system as proposed by a blue-ribbon panel.\n\nAbacus Data CEO David Coletto tells Lauren he thinks the Liberals will wind up pursuing a \"fill the gaps\" approach, in which Ottawa steps in to fund coverage where it\u2019s most needed, but not fund everything.\n\n\u2014 Importation: The poll also asked about plans in a growing number of U.S. states to import cheaper medicine from Canada. The Trump White House has indicated its support for plans, passed by states like Florida.\n\nLess than half of Canadians, just 48 percent, said they\u2019re aware of such plans. Those who are aware are mostly concerned about shortages and want Ottawa to intervene to block the U.S. from importing drugs.\n\nSTILL TIED AT HALFTIME \u2014 The official campaign is hitting its halfway mark with a race too close to call.\n\nAn aggregate of national surveys shows the Liberals and Conservatives tied at 34 percent of the popular vote, the same as last week. The Liberals still hold a structural advantage with leads in the critical battleground provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n\nHowever, Coletto tells Alex to keep an eye on two things: The Oct. 7 and 10 televised debates. He also says the NDP, a perennial threat to the Liberals, is worth watching as it inched up two points from last week, to 14 percent.\n\nSEVERAL LEADERS ARE READY TO EXPAND IMMIGRATION \u2014 In the latest installment of our leader questionnaires, POLITICO asked the heads of the five main national parties: \"Should Canada have more, less, or about the same levels of immigration?\"\n\nThe three calling for an immigration increase are the left-of-center party leaders. Trudeau has already planned increases through 2021, while the leaders of the NDP and Green Party say Canada should be doing more. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer tells us immigration \"good,\" and \"right,\" but won't discuss targets. To Scheer's right, the People's Party's Maxime Bernier wants immigration levels reduced.\n\n\u2014 Two countries, two paths. Some surveys, including a POLITICO/Abacus poll, suggest there's a receptive audience in Canada for tighter immigration policy. But it\u2019s not showing up much in the Canadian platforms.\n\nOver the weekend, the Green Party promised to increase the intake of refugees driven away from their homes by climate change. Yet on Friday, the Trump administration ordered a drastic reduction in refugees being allowed into the U.S. The latest such cutback would see the U.S. accept only 18,000 refugees next year, much lower than what Canada takes in.\n\n\u2014 The Trump administration and House Democrats tasked with securing changes to the new North American trade pact have already resolved some issues of concern. While most of Washington is focused on impeachment talk, a key House committee chairman reports new bipartisan progress on USMCA.\n\n\u2014 Immigration lawyers in B.C. and Washington State say more travelers driving across the U.S. border are being issued five-year bans. These \"expedited removals\" are decided by an immigration officer. CBC News.\n\n\u2014 The Conservatives became the first party to register candidates in all 338 ridings. The party said that 107 of those candidates are women. Global News.\n\n\u2014 The Liberals are requesting an investigation by Saskatchewan insurance-industry authorities into Scheer. That\u2019s after a Globe and Mail report that found no evidence Scheer, who describes himself as a former insurance broker, never actually had the required qualifications. CBC News.\n\n\u2014 Some Canadian reporters have tried talking to the man who originally tipped off Time Magazine about one of Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos. Michael Adamson released a statement saying he\u2019s not a member of any party; was motivated by the belief that Canadians should see the photo; and asked that his privacy be respected.\n\n9:30 a.m. \u2014 The Woodrow Wilson Center's Environmental Change and Security Program holds a discussion on \"Hidden Forces: The Role of Water in Economic Prosperity.\" 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Sixth Floor, Washington, D.C.\n\n1 p.m. \u2014 The Center for Strategic and International Studies holds a discussion on a new report on China's Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem. 1616 Rhode Island Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n4:30 p.m. \u2014 The Atlantic Council holds a discussion on \"Reenergizing Transatlantic Space Cooperation in Security and Beyond,\" as part of the Defense-Industrial Policy series. 1030 15th St. NW, 12th Floor, Washington, D.C.\n\nDid we miss an event?
