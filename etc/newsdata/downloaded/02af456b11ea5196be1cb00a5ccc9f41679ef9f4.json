(You interact with them every day via the likes of Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.)\n\n\u201cStardog solves the data silo problem that exists in every enterprise by connecting data no matter its format, location, or meaning. The result is deeper insight faster,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cResponding to customer feedback and market needs means we continually invest in talent and technology to help the largest companies make better decisions.\u201d\n\nStardog previously raised a $6 million Series A funding round in 2017 before increasing its Series A funding to $9 million by adding $3 million in 2018. Customers now include Morgan Stanley, Dow Jones, Siemens and the U.S. Air Force, per a press release.\n\nDan Levine, managing partner at Tenfore Holdings, will join Stardog\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cModern-day problems deal with hybrid, varied, and changing data, which is not always practical or even possible at scale using SQL-based systems,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe potential for Stardog\u2019s graph platform to help organizations gain accurate insights from a sea of data is limitless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStardog employs 50 people \u2014 half of which are based in Arlington \u2014 and aims to double the total headcount with this Series B, a spokesperson told Technical.ly.

That announcement came a few weeks after the company released an updated version of its knowledge graph platform.\n\n-30-", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://technical.ly/dc/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/08/bigdata.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
