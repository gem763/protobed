They determined to cut exports to the U.S. and European allies by 5% each month until Israel withdrew from the territories it occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nThe price of oil initially popped 70%. By December, it rose another 130%, and OPEC imposed a full embargo on the U.S. and other Israel sympathizers. The price of oil quadrupled, and given the extent of dependence on OPEC oil, an energy crisis ensued.\n\nWestern targets suffered gas shortages, rationing and price gouging; the New York Stock Exchange dropped $97 billion; and the U.S. stumbled into a recession.\n\nThe brunt of the oil pain endured until March 1974, when the U.S. helped negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Syria, but oil prices have never fully waned to their pre-embargo rates.\n\nSome experts fear a repeat of the 1973 crisis as oil-rich Saudi Arabia resists U.S. pressures to investigate the suspicious disappearance of a Saudi-critical U.S. resident.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nThis Day In Market History: Disney's Predecessor Cartoon Studio Kicks Off\n\nThis Day In Market History: Department Of Homeland Security Established\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
