Case in point: Charlize Theron\u2019s new circular \u2019do.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Theron announced that her character from The Fate of the Furious (aka Fast 8) was back for the action franchise\u2019s upcoming ninth installment, with a shocking revelation. A photo of Theron shows the actress sporting a bowl cut that can best be described as Chynna Phillips in the music video for Wilson Phillips\u2019s \u201cHold On\u201d meets Minkus from Boy Meets World.\n\nCompared to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s medieval royal bowl cut and Celine Dion\u2019s high-fashion bowl cut, Theron\u2019s is more of a traditional take on what seems to be this year\u2019s hottest hairstyle. Who knew?\n\nBefore you scream, \u201cwig!\u201d like I did, it appears that Theron\u2019s bowl cut is, indeed, legit. As Popsugar reports, celebrity hairstylist Adir Abergel gave Theron the cut, which was inspired by a photo Peter Lindbergh took of Linda Evangelista in the early \u201990s. Unsurprisingly, Theron pulls off this somewhat contentious hairstyle quite effortlessly.\n\nIn Fast & Furious 9, which comes out in May of next year, Theron will be reprising her role as cybervillain Cipher, alongside franchise regulars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, and Ludacris. Dame Helen Mirren is also returning, and John Cena is joining the cast.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, at least Theron won\u2019t be sporting white-girl dreads like she did in Fast 8.\n\nStay in touch.
