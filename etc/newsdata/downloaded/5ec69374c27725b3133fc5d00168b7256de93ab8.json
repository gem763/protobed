We were blowing out there but we put a massive focus on the first 20 minutes and the effort we put into that first 20 minutes took a bit of the pressure off.\u201d\n\nIt was the second successive bonus-point victory for Conor O\u2019Shea\u2019s side after last Sunday\u2019s 47-22 win over Namibia and all but assured them of at least third place in a pool that includes heavyweights New Zealand and South Africa. They have 10 points but still need to face the All Blacks and Springboks, who are expected to qualify for the quarter-finals, short of an upset of the magnitude of Wednesday\u2019s win for Uruguay over Fiji in Kamaishi.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: fixtures, tables and results Read more\n\nThe Italians, who rested several players, were in no mood to allow a second shock within the space of 24 hours and were led by rampaging loose forwards Jake Polledri, Braam Steyn and Sebastian Negri. For the first 15 minutes they demonstrated that the gulf between tier-one and tier-two nations was still in existence, with Steyn and Budd exploiting some poor defence to give their side a 17-0 lead by the 13th minute.\n\nFacing a rout, the North Americans started to make their tackles and they enjoyed spells of possession that presented three gilt-edged opportunities to get back into the game, the most prominent when captain Tyler Ardron burst through and passed to replacement flanker Matt Heaton, who dropped the ball with the line open.\n\nWing DTH van der Merwe also started to make his presence felt, creating space down the left, but when the Canadians wasted a three-on-one chance the momentum swung back to the Italians and they went into half-time with a 17-0 advantage.\n\nPlay Video 0:16 Rugby World Cup interviewer calls Italy's Dean Budd the Canada captain \u2013 video\n\nNegri extended the lead when he also smashed over from close range before Canada again failed to capitalise on an opportunity when Van der Merwe created space through the midfield and managed to put Jeff Hassler clear only for Matteo Minozzi to produce a try-saving tackle on the wing within five metres of the line.\n\nReferee Nigel Owens then awarded a penalty try that secured the bonus point for the Italians, following an illegal challenge from Heaton, before replacement wing Mattia Bellini crossed with 19 minutes remaining.\n\nOwens awarded Ardron a try only for the television match official Rowan Kitt to overturn for a knock-on before the ball landed in the Canadian No 8\u2019s hands. The decision was met by a chorus of boos but the crowd, now firmly behind the Canadians, rose to their feet minutes later when the underdogs scored the best try of the match with a superb finish by wing Andrew Coe.\n\nItaly, however, finished strongly, with replacement hooker Federico Zani shunted over from a driving maul before Bellini put Minozzi in to close out the scoring.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nO\u2019Shea said: \u201cYou have to be pretty happy. We started the game really well and that\u2019s where we imposed ourselves \u2026 and in the last 20 minutes drove it home the physical dominance we had.\u201d\n\nHis opposite number Kingsley Jones rued Canada\u2019s failure to capitalise on their spells in possession: \u201cWe just didn\u2019t finish our opportunities. If we had taken a gift under the posts then that changes the shape of the game, not just the scoreboard, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t take those chances.\u201d\n\nFlanker Jake Polledri, who was awarded man of the match, told the official World Cup website: \u201cOur main focus was the four-day turnaround which makes it difficult but we couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more really.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy is to play without fear and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing and it\u2019s good to see if on the pitch.\u201d", "description": "Italy scored seven tries in a 48-7 victory over Canada for their second straight bonus-point victory in Pool B", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d97196c06b97ac0589ae45a477bbe804f0e4961/0_134_4528_2717/master/4528.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7cd0906dc3636458f0286090954de8a4", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
