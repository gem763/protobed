According to the SEC complaint Telgram failed to register their offers and sales of the tokens, which the SEC considers to be securities.\n\n\u201cOur emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, in a statement. \u201cWe allege that the defendants have failed to provide investors with information regarding Grams and Telegram\u2019s business operations, financial condition, risk factors, and management that the securities laws require.\u201d", "description": "Cryptocurrency\u2019s bad news day continues to get worse as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it has filed an emergency action and received a restraining order for the $1.7 billion planned token offering of Telegram\u2019s blockchain.
