Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe cast and writers of SNL return to their offices at 30 Rock next week to get to work on the season 45 premiere, but the excitement surrounding upcoming hosts and new cast members has recently been overshadowed by the news of new featured player Shane Gillis, who was fired on Monday after multiple racist and homophobic remarks he made on podcasts as recently as May 2019 began to circulate online. It was a four-day whirlwind from hiring to firing, and SNL\u2019s statement on Monday confirmed one thing that fans of the show had been wondering about: the audition and vetting process. \u201cWe are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier,\u201d SNL\u2019s statement read, \u201cand that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nTo get a new perspective on the controversy, Vulture recently spoke with a comedian who auditioned for the show this year to get their take on the Gillis fiasco as well as some insight on how the SNL audition process works in the era of Twitter and podcasts. The comedian, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, offered up some very candid answers.\n\nA lot has been written over the years about the SNL audition process, like the New York Times piece in 2013. But I was hoping you could run me through what it\u2019s like now, because, thanks to stuff like Twitter, we\u2019re at a very different place than we were then.\n\nI\u2019ve showcased a couple times, where you just do a show in front of the people who work there. It\u2019s usually about 15 comedians. You go up and you do a five-minute set. I\u2019ve done that a couple times and I\u2019ve never gone on from there.\n\nBut then this last time I showcased, a couple weeks later, they asked me to go test for it. They changed the date around a couple of times, and then they fly you out to New York. You go wait in a hallway, or I guess they give you a green room, but nobody wants to wait in their green rooms because everybody wants to see how it went for the last person. You can\u2019t really hear or watch \u2014 you can barely hear the other person\u2019s set, the people onstage.\n\nRight.\n\nI was there for probably five hours before I went up. And then it\u2019s the classic story: You go onstage, everybody\u2019s sitting in chairs or standing up. And there\u2019s some laughs, but mostly not. You do a punchline that you\u2019re used to killing, and it\u2019s just people going \u201cHa ha ha. Ha ha.\u201d That\u2019s kind of about it.\n\nMy test didn\u2019t go super well, but I really didn\u2019t want it. It\u2019s just never been a real dream of mine to be on Saturday Night Live. When they asked me to test for it, my initial thought was dread, but it was immediately followed by I\u2019m going to be the biggest star on Saturday Night Live ever, I can do it. Maybe I\u2019ll be the one to change everything at Saturday Night Live and it\u2019ll become a really funny show again! All that stuff. And I kept thinking about how my life would change if I had to be on SNL. I went through the Rolodex of friends that I have who work there, thinking, Okay, if I had to work there, I\u2019d at least have so-and-so there, and so-and-so there, you know?\n\nBut I mean, you would take the offer if you got it, right?\n\nYeah, I would. Also, you have to. If you agree to go test out there, you can\u2019t turn it down without, like, legal issues. The women walk around SNL and they make you sign a contract, and everybody jokes you\u2019re signing your life away. But it\u2019s true! I think [with] the contract, you gotta be there as long as they want you there for the first five years or something like that.\n\nOkay. Interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s a wild contract. They\u2019re sort of in charge of what you\u2019re able to go do, and it\u2019s funny because they\u2019re so interested in what you\u2019re able to do while you\u2019re on SNL. They\u2019re in charge of your projects that you work on outside of the show and all that stuff, I imagine, because they don\u2019t want to mess with the integrity of Saturday Night Live. But they didn\u2019t really care about what people did before SNL! [Laughs.]\n\nDo you consider yourself an SNL fan?\n\nNo, not really. I mean, I like a lot of stuff on SNL \u2014 I have friends who have written some really funny sketches, some people who\u2019ve been in some really funny things. The things that I think are really good are things that are so insular; it\u2019s so specific to the person who wrote it or is in it that it\u2019s not necessarily an SNL sketch, it\u2019s a that-person sketch.\n\nWere you around when Shane auditioned?\n\nYeah, I was there.\n\nDid you meet him?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nWas there any sort of vetting process for you that you were aware of?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think there really was \u2014 for me. And I make fun of SNL a lot. There\u2019s tweets and stuff where I\u2019m making fun of it.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s possible that one of the reasons you didn\u2019t get the job was because of those tweets?\n\n\ufeffI think I didn\u2019t get hired because they didn\u2019t think I was right for the show. I think whatever I\u2019ve said about SNL in the past isn\u2019t a big enough reason to not hire me. But I don\u2019t think there was really much vetting at all. Going into it I was very aware I didn\u2019t have red-state appeal, which is something they\u2019re always looking for \u2026\n\nYou knew they were looking for that?\n\n\ufeffYeah.\n\nOh, really?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s something that they\u2019re always looking for, the last few years.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nI started hearing the term \u201cred-state appeal\u201d a few years ago only in regard to SNL. Red-state appeal has been a thing that SNL has been looking for since Trump got elected. I imagine it\u2019s because they want to appeal to people in the middle of the country who they feel they\u2019ve alienated with all their left-leaning political sketches. It\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve heard from comedians and reps. It\u2019s a term that has gotten thrown around a bunch in the last couple years [in regard to SNL]. I imagine that\u2019s why they\u2019re always trying to go for the \u201cbro\u201d \u2014 the guy with the brown hair and the, you know, the face. [Laughs.]\n\nRight.\n\nThey\u2019re really hoping, I guess, that they\u2019ll be able to do some stuff that appeals to Middle America or the South. They think of the South and Middle America as stupid racists, I guess. Maybe that\u2019s kind of harsh, but this is a constant problem in Hollywood: The people who make things think their audience is stupid, when in reality they\u2019re not.\n\nAnd as far as Shane goes, I met him just in the hallway before the audition, and he was a really polite, nice guy. He didn\u2019t hang out with everybody as much \u2026 There was a big group of people hanging out in the hallway, and he was mostly in his green room hanging out.\n\nI wonder if Shane could\u2019ve saved himself from getting fired with an actual apology instead of that statement.\n\n\ufeffOh yeah, for sure, if he just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was being an idiot. What I said was really racist and I was a bully, and I\u2019ve never been under such a magnifying glass, and it\u2019s been good that now I actually have to think about what I\u2019m saying and putting out there.\u201d But I don\u2019t think that that is within him. I think that he thinks he\u2019s being a badass, which is why everyone made fun of that apology so much. [It\u2019s] lacking any self-awareness. He just thinks, like, I\u2019m a badass comedian who takes risks. He\u2019s just begging to be made fun of for that. Taking that route is kind of cowardly and sort of egomaniacal. So why would SNL want to continue to have that person there?\n\nRight.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel like SNL should keep him. It should be a lesson to them to not just hire anybody because you\u2019re desperate for red-state appeal or whatever it is. You hired this guy, you\u2019re stuck with him. Now you gotta deal with all this shit he said or might continue to say. But don\u2019t just go \u201cOh whoops, we made a mistake!\u201d and fire him.\n\nThese places shouldn\u2019t be so desperate to appeal to a certain demographic in this day and age. They should just try to make comedy that\u2019s funny and good. It just sucks nowadays that \u201cred-state appeal\u201d \u2014 having a person on a show who might be a bit more in the center than on the left or the right \u2014 also means that you\u2019re running the risk of that person also being a racist. The floodgates have been opened, and it\u2019s a really tricky line to toe. And it really bit them in the ass in casting Shane.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some people post videos of old SNL sketches that are pretty racist, or at least are playing off racist stereotypes, to argue that Shane\u2019s firing is hypocritical. Do you think there\u2019s a discussion to be had there?\n\n\ufeffNo \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s old!\n\nYeah.\n\nIt\u2019s old shit! We\u2019ve all said and done really inappropriate, bad things a long time ago. It\u2019s only been recently that people from these different backgrounds \u2014 not just fucking white people \u2014 have said, \u201cHey, this really fucks with me and hurts my feelings.\u201d And then people have had to go, \u201cOh yeah, shit.\u201d It\u2019s only been in the last 20 years, maybe.\n\nMost of those sketches are from the early \u201990s, and a lot of them are really fucking inappropriate and wrong for no real reason. And those comedians don\u2019t do that anymore. So yeah, SNL maybe has always been a little bit backwards, and they\u2019re trying to do a cool thing. Casting Bowen [Yang] was really exciting, because Bowen is so funny and strange and interesting. But at the same time, I just can\u2019t stop thinking about how they made Bowen write for a year before they put him on the show, and then they just cast Shane right away. It still feels kind of weird. I don\u2019t know, man.\n\nRich white people have always been bad; they\u2019ve always done really fucked-up shit. It\u2019s only been recently that they\u2019ve been trying to change, and even asked to try to change. And so the fact that these people are going \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019m pushing boundaries\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s like, no, you\u2019re not pushing boundaries! This is hack. I really think nowadays, something that is pushing boundaries is if Dana Carvey went onstage and sang \u201cChoppin\u2019 Broccoli.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s more boundary-pushing than someone saying a bunch of racist shit about Asians. Because 50 percent of white-dude comics nowadays feel like they\u2019ve got a hot take, which is the big problem. Shut up about your hot take. Be silly. That\u2019s more interesting than anything.\n\nWhat do you hope the show takes away from this?\n\nI don\u2019t really know what SNL should take away from this, because it\u2019s run by a really old man. I don\u2019t think he really is losing any sleep over any of this.\n\nIt\u2019s just another year.\n\nI think it\u2019s truly just another year, and he\u2019s just an old billionaire who stays up until 4 a.m. I really don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to learn anything from this. They fired Shane, so now they\u2019re just like, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nWhat about you? Any interesting takeaways?\n\nThe funny thing that me and all my friends keep looking at is, with Shane\u2019s apology, the only people who are in defense of Shane are white guys. It\u2019s a legion of these white dudes who are going, \u201cOh, he\u2019s making a joke! Cancel culture over a joke!\u201d or whatever. But nobody is looking around and going, \u201cOh shit, we\u2019re just a mob of white guys.\u201d I just can\u2019t believe that these people don\u2019t see that. It feels really scary and gross.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nOne Great Story: A Nightly Newsletter for the Best of New York The one story you shouldn't miss today, selected by New York's editors.
