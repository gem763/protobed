You can guess what happened next.", "language": "en", "text": "Illinois state Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr. was being interviewed about the bird-poop problem at a Chicago Transit Authority station when a pigeon proved his point, relieving itself on his head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have to go clean up,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker told CBS Chicago\u2019s Lauren Victory after running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens to my constituents. They get [expletive] on all the time.\u201d\n\nBird poop has long plagued the Irving Park Blue Line station, covering the sidewalks and angering commuters. So entrenched is the problem, the television station reported, that some have dubbed Irving Park the \u201cpigeon poop station.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeady eyes watch your moves like Mona Lisa; the cement below painted with pigeon excrement,\u201d CBS Chicago explained in an earlier dispatch on the situation.\n\nAndrade, who told The Washington Post that part of the problem is a notorious pigeon-feeder (\u201cShe found God, and God told her she must save all the pigeons\u201d), has been fighting for a solution. He\u2019s thinking of asking the transit authority to put in a hose line for power-washing.\n\nGood Morning All make sure to see the interview Monday Morning with Lauren Victory on CBS Chicago news on Monday Morning... Posted by Jaime Andrade, State Representative, 40th District on Saturday, September 14, 2019\n\nHe said his constituents are constantly complaining to him about the birds. Some have showed him their \u201cpigeon-poop shoes,\u201d worn only to the station and never in the house.\n\nAfter his own experience with the problem, Andrade had to go home to wash his hair before a day of meetings. He said he was lucky he didn\u2019t have to go right downtown or report to someone.\n\n\u201cIf I did, I would have to say, \u2018Listen, I just got pooped on; I can\u2019t make it to work this morning,\u2019 or I got to go to work, and the first thing I got to do is wash my head at work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could ruin your whole day.\u201d\n\nNow the issue is known to the whole world. The clip from the interview went \u201ca little viral,\u201d Andrade said, which he hopes will push the city of Chicago to do something. People have sent him news stories from as far away as Ireland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing to see,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made the Drudge Report \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re calling.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAngry birds: Swooping Australian magpie causes fatal cyclist crash\n\nThese tigers were rescued from an infamous tourist attraction.
