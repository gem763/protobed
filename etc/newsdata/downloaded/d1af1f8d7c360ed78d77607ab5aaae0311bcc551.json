Each telescope gives us a different clue about what's going on in these systems,\" said Pfeifle. \"We hope to extend our work to find more triples using the same technique.\"\n\nIf you're keeping track: The system where the black holes are located is known as SDSS J084905.51+111447.2.", "description": "A trio of supermassive black holes is going to collide.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/two-supermassive-black-holes-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
