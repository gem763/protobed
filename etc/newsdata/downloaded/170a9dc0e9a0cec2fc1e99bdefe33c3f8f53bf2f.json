Ben is senior political reporter for Jewish Insider. Ben is on Twitter at @BenCJacobs.\n\nBen\u2019s Music Pick: Gram Parsons\n\nConsidered to be one of the godfathers of country rock, Gram Parsons had his own name for what he was trying to achieve: \u201ccosmic American music\u201d. That meant country, blues, soul, rock, and folk all rolled into one. Parsons\u2019 output during his short time on earth is staggering for its quality and quantity. Before his death at the age of 26, Parsons had formed the International Submarine Band before leaving to join The Byrds. After only a few short months in that band, he quit to create the Flying Burrito Brothers. Following his dismissal from the Burritos, he crafted two immaculate solo albums with the help of Emmylou Harris. None of the records sold very well at the time, but virtually all have become classics of the genre. It\u2019s entirely possible, even as a music fan, you\u2019re entirely unfamiliar with Parsons oeuvre. No worries! We\u2019ll walk you through the catalog, explain what\u2019s important and why, and celebrate the vision of an American original: Gram Parsons.", "description": "Scot and Jeff discuss Gram Parsons with Ben Jacobs.", "authors": ["David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "John Fund", "George Will", "Jack Crowe", "Kyle Smith", "Jonah Goldberg", "Rich Lowry", "Hosted Scot Bertram"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cover_flying-burrito-brothers.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
