Fox Searchlight, a frequent Oscar winner eager to demonstrate its clout after its acquisition by Disney, is premiering Taika Waititi\u2019s Jojo Rabbit, which is billed as an anarchic \u201canti-hate satire\u201d that follows a young Nazi boy (Roman Griffin Davis) who has to contend with the discovery of a Jewish woman (Thomasin McKenzie) whom his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding in the attic. Waititi\u2019s high-energy humor probably won\u2019t be for everyone, but the film is certain to have its fervent fans, thanks to Waititi\u2019s own growing celebrity (he plays an imaginary version of Hitler).\n\nAnother, more serious World War II film is Fox Searchlight\u2019s A Hidden Life, a Terrence Malick epic about Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter, a conscientious objector from Austria who was persecuted by his country for refusing to fight. Though Malick\u2019s output of late has been too abstract to break through with a wider audience, this movie (which played at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival) is powered by a strong, accessible narrative and Malick\u2019s inimitable visual poeticism. Arguably the most enigmatic Fox Searchlight project is Lucy in the Sky, the directorial debut of the TV auteur Noah Hawley (Fargo, Legion), which follows Natalie Portman as an astronaut tormented by an affair. The story seems to be powered by the same aesthetic meticulousness that defines Hawley\u2019s small-screen work.\n\nThe studio A24, which translated TIFF acclaim into an Oscar win for Moonlight a few years ago, has a trio of intense dramas: Uncut Gems, a New York thriller from the Safdie Brothers (Good Time) that is generating awards chatter for its star, Adam Sandler; The Lighthouse, a nautical two-hander from Robert Eggers (The Witch) starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson; and Waves, a mysterious family drama starring Sterling K. Brown and directed by Trey Edward Shults (It Comes at Night). Major studio entries for the coming months include the rip-roaring true story Hustlers; Rian Johnson\u2019s whodunnit, Knives Out; John Crowley\u2019s literary adaptation, The Goldfinch; the inspirational legal drama Just Mercy, starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx; and Edward Norton\u2019s long-stewing passion project, Motherless Brooklyn, which he directed and starred in.\n\nOne of the newest studio players at the festival is Neon, a distributor founded in 2017 that achieved early success with its Toronto acquisition of I, Tonya. After a lackluster 2018, Neon picked up two award winners at Cannes that will play at Toronto. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s romantic period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a breathtakingly beautiful work, a swooning love story deserving of wider attention. But I\u2019m most intrigued by the prospects of Bong Joon Ho\u2019s Parasite, a Korean-language thriller that won Cannes\u2019 Palme D\u2019Or and is the kind of rare delight that can turn its art-film plaudits into bigger financial success. If all goes according to Neon\u2019s plan at Toronto, the film could be on the road to a groundbreaking Oscar victory. The next two weeks will be crucial for Parasite, as well as dozens of other projects, as they look to sustain conversation for the season ahead.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
