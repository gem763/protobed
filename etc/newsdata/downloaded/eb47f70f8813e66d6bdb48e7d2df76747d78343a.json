A total of 326 295 new vehicles were sold on dealer floors through to September showing a -3.7% decline for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same time frame last year. This represents 12 555 less vehicles sold in 2019, or, just under 1 400 units a month. This is a significant number.\n\nGovernment action\n\nWith the recent 0.8% decline in household expenditure, the mercurial rand and GDP at its lowest since the 2008 global financial crisis, the National Automobile Dealers\u2019 Association (NADA) maintains that there are critical developments on the immediate horizon which could be the building blocks to boost business and consumer confidence.\n\nTreasury\u2019s White Paper, titled: Economic transformation, inclusive growth, and competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa, as radical as it may seem, is a vital step towards South Africa\u2019s economic recovery. The government needs to commit to this kind of action.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nThe paper outlines a series of themes and the contribution of growth reforms within each that prioritise economic transformation, inclusive growth, and competitiveness.\n\nNADA supports the ideals and pillars of the proposed themes, however, the application proposed may in certain areas have unintended consequences in our opinion.\n\nRolling blackouts\n\nFinance Minister Mr. Tito Mboweni's mini-budget statement, which is being delivered at the end of October is an important one, as it should seek to pave the way forward to economic reform in the short term, including a much-needed reduction in Government spending to reduce the budget deficit.\n\nInternational Ratings Agency Moody\u2019s will be scrutinising the mini-budget before they take a view on South Africa\u2019s investment-grade rating, which they will decide upon on 1 November 2019.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nThe sudden announcement by Eskom of rolling blackouts couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for business and will certainly exacerbate economic slowdown and consumer confidence.\n\nAs for our matriculants who started writing their final exams, my heart goes out to them for not being able to complete certain elements of their exams after putting so much time and effort into their studies and preparations. Hopefully, this round of load shedding will be short-lived.\n\nA stable path being laid for debt-laden Eskom is critical and should hopefully include the splitting of the Utility into three separate units.\n\nThe implementation of structural reforms in the Finance Minister\u2019s budget will go a long way towards gaining a modicum of growth and stability and alter the current discourse plaguing South Africa.
