Jim Himes told The Washington Times he believes his panel would pass along their work to the Judiciary committee.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judiciary committee, said that ultimately there is no change in how the investigations are operating.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is telling us that we\u2019re full steam ahead and the country will be with us if they aren\u2019t already,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere is no discussion of any structural changes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, another Judiciary Democrat, said details on their next steps would come out in the coming days.\n\nRather than focus on the process, many members, like Mr. Raskin and Ms. Jayapal, say the key difference is that there is a stronger sense of unity within the caucus.\n\n\u201cThe days of different points of view about it in the caucus are coming to an end and we have great consensus that we need to move forward aggressively,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, there is still a clear divide between members, though they all embrace the speaker\u2019s message.\n\nThere are some members who believe the caucus is ready to move forward on impeachment, like Ms. Jayapal, who told reporters she thinks the caucus is headed towards articles of impeachment.\n\nOther members, like Reps. Henry Cuellar and Susan Wild, are reserving judgment until after the investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
