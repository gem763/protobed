None of their ecological needs is considered.\u201d\n\nFour Paws said in many cases during the investigation across Europe last month animals were seen kept in small enclosures or cages, causing psychological and physical damage.\n\nThe group says while Asia\u2019s wildlife tourism industry is widely reported, little is known about the \u201cruthless\u201d abuse closer to home and the evidence found was \u201chorrendous\u201d.\n\nAt German circuses, visitors rode on elephants\u2019 backs \u2013 controversial because behind-the-scenes training often involves hitting the animals with sharp hooks.\n\nIn circus rings they were made to sit on small chairs, play football and stand on one leg.\n\nResearchers say that every year there is a tug-of-war between the elephants and villagers, and in winter the animals have to pull sledges.\n\n\u201cElephants are highly intelligent herd animals who migrate and occupy vast areas of land. It is extremely cruel to keep them enclosed in small spaces and exploit them,\u201d said Mr Harkin.\n\n\u201cLack of movement in captivity can result in joint or back problems, in addition to the indeterminable psychological distress.\u201d\n\nTourists in Spain were put at risk when they played and took selfies with a tiger, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cThe footage shows how the tiger snaps at a visitor while playing chase \u2013 behaviour expected from a tiger but that makes interactions extremely dangerous for humans.\n\n\u201cThe tiger is a predator weighing about 300kg with sharp teeth and claws. Her natural instincts cannot be suppressed.\u201d\n\nThe female tiger is among more than 100 other wild animals rented out for film productions and used as tourist photo props.\n\n\u201cTigers are commercially traded and treated as a commodity throughout Europe, and this can overlap with illegal tiger trade,\u201d said Mr Harkin.\n\nAt a French zoo an animal tamer went into a cage alone with up to 10 tigers; elsewhere orangutans were kept in small cages.\n\n\u201cIronically a video is played before the show pointing out the importance of conservation of tigers. The commercialisation and exploitation of these animals have nothing to do with the conservation of wild tigers \u2013 on the contrary,\u201d he said.\n\nBack in the Czech Republic, at a castle in Cesky Krumlov, investigators also saw three bears kept in a stone moat, denied the chance to climb or roam free.\n\nThe Independent has asked the castle authorities and a Spanish company where tourists take selfies with tigers to comment.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that in the 21st century it\u2019s legal in Europe to abuse wild animals for entertainment,\u201d said Mr Harkin.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the animals once they become too old or sick to perform or when the cubs are too old for petting?\u201d\n\nHynek Navratil, director of Cirkus Humberto, said their animals, which were in \u201cperfect condition, better than in zoos\u201d, were regularly checked by vets and were considered family members and colleagues, trained with a rewards system.\n\nStereotypical behaviour from stress is never seen in Czech circuses, he said. \u201cWe play with them, it keeps their brains working.\u201d\n\n\u201cActivist groups spread disinformation and stimulate xenophobic behaviour towards people in circuses. Because of that, we are reporting death threats to police, every week,\u201d Mr Navratil said.\n\nBut the circus \u201cdefeated\u201d the groups by opening its gates to the public, including training, so people can see the conditions. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cWe do not take Four Paws and such organisations as partners to dialogue. They do not not know anything about us, nor they do not know anything about our animals... We cannot respect them.\u201d\n\nIllegal breeding was not possible, he said, adding: \u201cOur animals are not slaves. Sometimes some animal does not want to perform on a certain day. Then it does not.\n\n\u201cThese animals cannot be considered wild. According to modern genome studies, it has been proven that domestication takes a sudden twist within five generations.\u201d", "description": "\u201cHorrendous\u201d cases of animals being abused to please tourists\u00a0across Europe have been filmed by investigators.
