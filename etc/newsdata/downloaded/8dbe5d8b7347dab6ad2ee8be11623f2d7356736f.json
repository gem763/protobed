The hires in question, data specialists Eric Mayefsky and Nina Wornhoff, were recommended to campaign manager Mike Schmuhl by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nThe campaign has aggressively fought back against allegations of even a whiff of impropriety, noting that Zuckerberg\u2019s emails were sent at the applicants\u2019 request, and that Buttigieg\u2019s team had received more than 7,000 job applications between Buttigieg\u2019s breakout appearance on a CNN town hall in March and his campaign\u2019s official launch the following month.\n\n\u201cOther people we have gotten staff recommendations from: former Presidents, civil rights leaders, members of Congress, Pete\u2019s high school teacher,\u201d tweeted Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe make staff decisions on how to build the best team in politics, which I\u2019m proud to report we have!\u201d\n\nBut as some fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls call for the government to potentially break up large tech companies, and Facebook\u2019s leadership continues to defend the company\u2019s position that politicians should be considered exempt from its rules regarding hate speech, harassment and false advertising, the relationship between Buttigieg and Silicon Valley is under renewed scrutiny.\n\nFor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose political life has been defined by curbing corporate power, the appearance of any coziness between Zuckerberg and a political campaign\u2014particularly one that\u2019s hot on her tail in Iowa\u2014is bad enough as it is, regardless of the fact that the two staffers hired were not in political roles.\n\n\u201cMy views on Mark Zuckerberg are pretty clear: He runs a company that has too much political power,\u201d Warren told a gaggle of reporters on Monday, when asked about the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 exchange. \u201cThey already have way too much influence in Washington and they are helping drive every conversation in a way that will protect Mark Zuckerberg and his company but that undermines our democracy. That is why I have said I think it\u2019s time to enforce the antitrust laws that are already on the books\u2014we need to break up these big tech companies.\u201d\n\nWarren has pointed to Facebook\u2019s outsized influence and alleged disinterest in preventing the spread of fake news as evidence that the company has failed to learn the lessons of the 2016 presidential campaign, when pages dedicated to sharing fake news\u2014sometimes with the assistance or orchestration of the Russian government\u2014targeted voters in the lead-up to the election.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Mark,\u201d Warren tweeted last week, after Zuckerberg gave a defensive address at Georgetown University. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies\u2026 Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again\u2014and profit off of it.\u201d\n\nBy one measure, at least, Buttigieg is far and away the preferred candidate of Facebook\u2019s employees. According to a review of Federal Election Commission data by The Daily Beast, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, raked in $23,095.36 in donations from Facebook employees in the first six months of 2019, a sum that includes checks written by some of the company\u2019s most senior employees. David Marcus, the former president of PayPal and current head of Facebook Messenger, donated $2,800 to Buttigieg the day before he officially launched his campaign; Naomi Gleit, senior director of the growth, engagement, and mobile team at Facebook and the company\u2019s vice president of \u201csocial good,\u201d also donated $2,800.\n\nOther high-level donors from Facebook\u2019s upper ranks include Maz Sharafi, global head of marketing for WhatsApp ($2,000), Victoria Grand, WhatsApp\u2019s vice president of policy and communications ($2,000), and Elliot Schrage, the company\u2019s former vice president of global communications, marketing, and public policy who led its response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal ($2,000).\n\nIn comparison, the rest of the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates have raised far less money from Facebook employees over the same period\u2014although Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have both called for the government to take antitrust action to break up Facebook, have each actually received more individual donations from the company\u2019s workers. In the first six months of 2019, Sanders raised $6,084 from 88 Facebook employees, while Warren raised $9,362.80 from 65 employees, and former Vice President Joe Biden raised $1,500 from seven people.\n\n(For the curious, President Donald Trump has raised $383.91 from 12 separate donations over the same period, all made by the same solitary Facebook employee.)\n\nSome of that pocketbook enthusiasm is likely rooted in Buttigieg\u2019s discomfort with the idea of breaking up Facebook, which his rivals say has become too powerful and monopolistic. After Harvard acquaintance and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes published a piece in the New York Times calling for the company to be broken up, Buttigieg told the San Jose Mercury News that while Hughes \u201cmade a very convincing case\u201d that no company \u201cshould have the type of power that\u2026 these tech companies have,\u201d he would prefer implementing \u201ca spectrum\u201d of regulations over the industry.\n\nSome preference may lie beyond policy, however. Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the field, has called for increasing the government\u2019s technological literacy, pointing to congressional hearings in 2018\u2014which featured Zuckerberg\u2014as an example of \u201cpeople in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing.\u201d\n\nPoliticians, Buttigieg told the Mercury News, \u201cneed some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly,\u201d although he added that the critique was \u201cnot necessarily an age thing.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s working relationship with Big Tech extends to before his run for the White House. When Zuckerberg set off on a much-hyped tour of the United States following Trump\u2019s inauguration, he joined Buttigieg in his hometown, streaming live video from the dashboard of Buttigieg\u2019s car as the pair toured the city and discussed proposals intended to lure tech startups to revitalize downtown South Bend.\n\n\u201cLike everybody else, I\u2019ll be very interested to hear what he makes of what we\u2019ve shown him,\u201d Buttigieg said at the time.\n\nBut Buttigieg\u2019s campaign denied that his support from Facebook employees and the tech industry more broadly means he\u2019s any softer on Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the campaign, we\u2019ve built a top-tier operation with more than 430 staff in South Bend and around the country,\u201d said national press secretary Chris Meagher in a statement. \u201cThe staffers come from all types of backgrounds, and everyone is working hard every day to elect Pete to the White House.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that passing along the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u201cshouldn\u2019t be taken as an endorsement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a number of colleagues who I\u2019d worked with at Facebook or my philanthropic foundation were interested in working there, they asked me or my wife Priscilla to send over their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, so I did that,\u201d Zuckerberg said on a press call on Monday, during a conversation about election security. \u201cI think that this probably should not be misconstrued as if I\u2019m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or anything like that.\u201d", "description": "The relationship between the world\u2019s most influential corporation and Buttigieg has come under scrutiny after Mark Zuckerberg passed along two r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to the campaign.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571706164/191021-bixby-pete-facebook-tease_ywpk5n", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
