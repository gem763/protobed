However, it will be treated as an entry point into the European single market.\n\nBritish authorities will apply UK tariffs to products from countries outside the EU as long as those goods entering Northern Ireland do not enter the single market, but EU tariffs will apply if those goods do head for the single market.\n\nBoth sides have agreed a mechanism overseen by a joint committee to assess the risk that goods entering Northern Ireland either from other countries outside the EU or from mainland Great Britain will then enter the EU via Ireland.\n\n191017094418680\n\nVAT\n\nAmong other things, negotiations have centred on the need to maintain the consistency on VAT rates in order to maintain the integrity of the EU single market for goods while providing certainty for business.\n\nUnder the new deal, a mechanism has been agreed to ensure consistency on VAT within Northern Ireland, while respecting the UK\u2019s ambitions to diverge in the digital market.\n\nThe role of the Northern Ireland Assembly\n\nA key demand of the DUP has been for the Northern Ireland Assembly in Stormont to have a mechanism by which it can continue to consent to the arrangement after the transition period following Brexit \u2013 in effect giving it a veto over the new arrangements.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s anti-Brexit arrangements argued that this would not only put too much power in the hands of pro-British unionists in the assembly, but was unrealistic given that the assembly has not convened for more than two years.\n\nUnder Johnson\u2019s new deal, there will be a consent mechanism that enables the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide by a simple majority if the arrangements stay four years after the end of the Brexit transition period \u2013 in effect removing the automatic veto from the DUP.", "description": "Boris Johnson and the EU have released a new withdrawal agreement that addresses four key sticking points.", "authors": ["Gavin O'Toole"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/6e7e9475a5ba49248786c135341277c8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
