REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n\nBy meeting Father James Martin during the morning, when the pope\u2019s meetings are part of his published schedule, instead of privately in the afternoon, Francis appeared to be defending Martin pointedly from the attacks.\n\nIn the last two years, a number of Catholic seminaries and universities have canceled lectures and appearances by Martin, often after pressure from conservative groups.\n\nMartin, a Jesuit like the pope, is the author of the 2017 book \u201cBuilding a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity\u201d.\n\nIn a Tweet after meeting the pope, Martin said he \u201cshared with him the joys and hopes, and the griefs and anxieties, of LGBT Catholics and LGBT people worldwide. I was so grateful to meet with this wonderful pastor\u201d.\n\nDescribing the meeting as one of the highlights of his life, Martin said he felt \u201cencouraged, consoled and inspired\u201d and that the 30-minute audience was \u201ca clear sign of (the pope\u2019s) deep pastoral care for LGBT Catholics and LGBT people\u201d.\n\nRorate Caeli, one of the conservative blogs that has often criticized Martin, Tweeted after the audience was made public: \u201cIt\u2019s the feast of St. Gay Rome.\u201d In another Tweet, Rorate Caeli said: \u201cIf that\u2019s not an endorsement, nothing is.\u201d\n\nFrancis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, which calls for reconciliation between the Church and gays, praised the pope.\n\nDeBernardo said in a statement that the meeting \u201crefutes the unjustified barrage of criticism he has received from a minority of Church leaders and other anti-LGBTQ sectors of the Church\u201d.\n\nHe called it \u201ca clear signal that Pope Francis is calling the Church to conversion away from the negative messages it has sent in the past about LGBTQ people. It is a day of celebration for LGBTQ Catholics who have longed for an outstretched hand of welcome from the Church that they love\u201d.\n\nThe Church teaches that homosexuals should be respected and their human dignity must be defended. It teaches that same-sex attractions are not sinful but homosexual acts are.", "description": "Pope Francis on Monday gave a high-profile private audience to a prominent American Jesuit priest who has been attacked repeatedly by conservative Catholics and media outlets for ministering to homosexuals.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435623437&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T17I-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
