The closed-door meeting was described as an avenue for Johnson and Varadkar to hold more detailed discussions on a possible alternative to the backstop \u2014 the guarantee of a \u201csoft\u201d trade border between EU-aligned Ireland and British-held Northern Ireland after Britain departs the European Union.\n\nVaradkar described the meeting as \u201cvery positive and very promising.\u201d He called for further negotiations.\n\n\u201cI do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. A spokesperson from Johnson\u2019s office said both leaders desire future talks.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting occurred amid ongoing discussions in Belgium among Brexit leaders that include EU negotiator Michel Barnier and British Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. Talks on the issue broke down in Brussels Wednesday.\n\n\u201c[We are] not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement,\u201d Barnier said.\n\nBarclay, who plans to meet with Barnier on Friday, said there\u2019s still hope for an agreement before two significant deadlines \u2014 Oct. 19 and Oct. 31. British law requires Johnson to seek a three-month extension if no agreement between the EU and London exists by the 19th. Britain is scheduled to leave the 28-nation block on the 31st.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put forward serious proposals and have been willing to be flexible,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the EU to do the same.\u201d\n\nJohnson has proposed replacing the backstop with customs stations on each side of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border, but it\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been wholly rejected by leaders in Dublin. The EU has also said the proposal is unworkable.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 With his promised EU departure date three weeks away, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Irish leader Leo Varadkar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
