Almost two thirds of adults in England were overweight or obese in 2017. The NHS recorded 10,660 hospital admissions in 2017/18 where obesity was the primary diagnosis.\n\nIn the US, the situation is starker still. More than 70% of adults over 20 are overweight or obese, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @GreekGodOfHops Fat shaming might not be healthy for all but I owe my whole entire career to being fat shamed. Coaches and scouts passed on me because of my body type for years. So I went out and did all the necessary things in order to prove them wrong. Wasn\u2019t easy but nothing is in life! https://t.co/YHWyhv3WzI \u2014 Kevin Youkilis (@GreekGodOfHops) September 14, 2019 Report\n\nOn Twitter, the former professional baseball player, Kevin Youkilis, claimed he owed his \"whole entire career\" to fat shaming, having initially been overlooked by scouts because of his weight.\n\nThat experience, though, is atypical, says Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at the University of Surrey.\n\n\"Shaming is the wrong way forward,\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Monday.\n\n\"All of the evidence is that fat shaming just makes people feel worse. It lowers their self-esteem. It makes them feel depressed and anxious and as a result of that what they then do is self-destructive.\"\n\nA study by behavioural scientists at University College London found rather than encouraging people to lose weight, fat shaming led people to put on more weight.\n\nImage copyright Victoria Abraham\n\nVictoria Abraham, 19, lives and studies in New York city, but grew up in Florida.\n\nShe says that her first hand experience shows Mr Maher is wrong about fat shaming.\n\n\"I have been shamed my entire life for my weight and I am still fat. When nasty comments were made to me as a child I used to go home after school and eat food to make myself feel better.\n\n\"It's not like people were saying these comments from a place of caring. They just wanted to make me feel small and negative about my body.\n\n\"The people who cared about my health were my parents and my doctor and that's it. They were the only people who had the right to talk to me about my body. The kids on the street were just teasing me for being different.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @ChloeInCurve If fat shaming actually worked there would be no fat people, because we have ALL been shamed at some point. \u2014 Chloe Elliott (@ChloeInCurve) September 16, 2019 Report\n\nVictoria stresses that she is now very confident about her body and reflects that if her younger self could have seen her now then her childhood would have been much happier.\n\n\"Back then you weren't allowed to be fat and happy,\" she said. \"You weren't allowed to love yourself no matter what you looked like\".\n\nIt was changing the media she consumed that made all the difference.\n\n\"After I finished middle school I started reading books with fat characters and watching TV with fat women which started to change the way I viewed myself. If you only see media with thin white women then you think something is wrong with you. But when you see beautiful fat women you start to see the beauty in yourself.\"\n\nVictoria also acknowledges the health impacts of obesity.\n\n\"Losing weight is good for your health but I am anti-diet. I have tried most of them and you just put the weight back on after the diet. Now I just try and do more exercise and eat healthier things.\"\n\n\"It's a very hard conversation to have,\" Professor Ogden told the BBC.\n\n\"The evidence out there for the impact of excess bodyweight and obesity - on cancer, on diabetes, on heart disease - is very clear. And that's education we need to have out there.\n\n\"But because the line between getting that message out there and then actually making someone feel ashamed of who they are is so fine, those conversations are very difficult.\"\n\nImage copyright Will Mavity\n\nEven if you do lose weight, fat shaming can negatively impact health in other ways.\n\nWill Mavity, 25, lives in Los Angeles. Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, he was, he says, \"extremely chubby\".\n\nIt is not a description you would use about him today.\n\n\"They would call me double d, and this stuff added up. When I started high school I decided the only way I could avoid this was to never be fat again,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBut Will developed an eating disorder.\n\n\"Fat shaming caused me to lose weight, but not in a healthy way. I started to purge after every meal,\" he said.\n\n\"I injure myself over and over again because of over-exercise. I feel I have to. I start getting angry whenever I cannot work out. I can't shake it. Because of the fat shaming, I associate my value as a human being with the way I look.\"\n\n\"Shaming anybody for anything doesn't help you - whatever the thing is that is being shamed,\" Professor Ogden explained.\n\n\"It's just not a positive way to run a society.\"", "description": "Fat chance - the evidence says fat shaming is more likely to lead people to put on weight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4563/production/_108836771_gettyimages-461448478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
