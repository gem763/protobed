It revealed some of its original programming plans and explained ways users could access all of its classics, like old Disney movies and Disney channel TV shows.\n\nThe company confirmed that Disney+ will be ad-free, and that it may be sold as a part of a bundled package along with Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nDisney says consumers will be able to download all of the content from Disney+ on an unlimited basis so long as they are subscribers.\n\nIt confirmed that the service will launch in late 2019 in North America. It says it will launch shortly after in Asia Pacific and will launch in Latin American in 2020.\n\nBetween the lines: With its acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets this year, Disney now owns a sizable content library, as well as a majority stake (60%) in Hulu. The company said it will push Hulu internationally (it's currently only available in the U.S. and Japan) and touted Hulu's success as a digital ad platform.\n\nIt otherwise didn't reveal many new details about ESPN+ (ESPN's new digital subscription service) or Hotstar, the biggest subscription streaming service in India. But executives from both companies still appeared and touted lots of user numbers.\n\nBe smart: The merger will go down as one of Bob Iger's defining moments as CEO and Chairman of the company. Iger announced Thursday that he will exit Disney after many years once his contract expires in 2021, although he joked that he's said that before.\n\nBottom line: Disney conquered the 20th century world of entertainment with great programming. Its message to investors Thursday was that it knows moving forward that great programming alone won't cement its dominance in entertainment. Distribution is just as important.", "description": "Iger announced Thursday that he will exit Disney after many years once his contract expires in 2021.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Yj_gjYpnon_eXhbpGSmKDpSKpUU=/0x0:2279x1282/1920x1080/2019/04/12/1555034486830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-12"}
