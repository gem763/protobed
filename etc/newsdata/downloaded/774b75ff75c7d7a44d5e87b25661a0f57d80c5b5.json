I think it\u2019s beautiful on every level.\u201d\n\nWhile Neale was speaking, Shaynna, still semi-speechless, began to cry.\n\n\u201cI just think you know when a house is built with love and I think that\u2019s what I am connecting with, there is something very healing about this interior,\u201d she said, while taking a seat next to Darren to try compose herself.\n\nDarren then felt he needed to be the pragmatic one \u2014 especially with Shaynna in tears and Neale completely blinded by the room\u2019s beauty.\n\n\u201cAndy and Deb had to decide whether to commit and spend their money wisely with the most impact they could possibly get,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think they have done that in spades.\n\n\u201cBecause what they have delivered is perfect, however from a judging point of view, house one (Mitch and Mark) and house two (Tess and Luke) have more value out of their floor plan than house three (Andy and Deb), so that adds another facet of judging for me.\u201d\n\nShaynna found her voice again and totally agreed: \u201cI think when we get to the end that\u2019s where our heads go because we are all about practicality.\u201d\n\nNeale still couldn\u2019t fault it, saying the couple have created a house that takes a buyer on that emotional journey.\n\n\u201cYou walk in and you fall in love with it. It\u2019s so beautifully balanced.\u201d\n\nStyle-wise, the judges said it had gone to an even higher level with Deb getting another pat on the back for her skills. A few weeks ago, Shaynna gave her the ultimate compliment, saying she has the capacity to be a great interior designer.\n\n\u201cNeutral doesn\u2019t equal boring and this room is a perfect example of that,\u201d Neale said.\n\nAesthetically, it was a perfect room, but it still wasn\u2019t enough to earn them the top spot with a score of 28.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Kitchen and butler\u2019s pantry reveal\n\nHOUSE 1: Mitch and Mark\n\nLast week Mitch and Mark\u2019s courtyard missed out on top spot by half a point, with the same thing happening this week.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take away from how impressed the judges were with their master ensuite and walk-in wardrobe.\n\nThey didn\u2019t get one piece of criticism except when Darren brought up their overall risk-taking floor plan changes, but even then Neale defended them.\n\n\u201cLook at the size of this,\u201d was the first thing Neale said when he walked into the ensuite.\n\nShaynna was just blown away, describing it as \u201csass personified\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a walk-in robe, I think it\u2019s a strutting-robe,\u201d Darren said.\n\nThen both he and Shaynna decided to strut while Neale watched on awkwardly.\n\nAccording to Shaynna, it had a \u201cSex in the City\u201d vibe.\n\n\u201cI like nothing better than having a few good pieces on display when you have got a space like this,\u201d she said while grabbing designer items off the glass shelves.\n\nAll three judges agreed every bit of styling suited the boys\u2019 entire house.\n\nShaynna then diverted her very excited attention to the cupboards and make-up table.\n\n\u201cLook at that dressing table, they have all the make-up laid out. You\u2019ve got your seat, you\u2019ve got natural light with the shutters. I think getting dressed in here would be joyous. I really do,\u201d she said.\n\nNeale was worried the bedroom lacked the boys\u2019 trademark pizzazz, but \u201cthey have more than compensated for it\u201d.\n\nShaynna was beside herself before seeing the ensuite\n\n\u201cOh my God I can\u2019t imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said again. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at that bath, that is just so beautiful and it\u2019s angled toward the natural light.\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to yell, \u201cI LOVE THIS, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Master ensuite reveal\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Formal lounge reveal\n\nNeale\u2019s first reaction was \u201chello luxury\u201d when he got a chance to speak above Shaynna\u2019s screaming.\n\nHe was drawn to the vanity walls, the tiles and the massive chandelier in the bathroom.\n\nOf course there was a chandelier in the bathroom, it\u2019s Mitch and Mark.\n\nDarren then brought up the change in floor plan, which was a touchy subject in the past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk having three bedrooms, not four,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then Neale interrupted, saying when one of those rooms looks like this \u201cyou got to be onto a winner, surely\u201d.\n\nThe Bondi boys came equal second with Jesse and Mel.\n\nHOUSE 2: Tess and Luke (Winners)\n\nEven though the judges were captivated by Andy and Deb\u2019s ensuite and the luxury oozing out of Mitch and Mark\u2019s room, Tess and Luke nabbed the top spot with their impressive, self-contained apartment.\n\nThe last time Tess and Luke won a room reveal was five weeks ago, so you can imagine how happy they were to steal first place.\n\nThey used a point they had won in a previous challenge to take out the winning spot by half a point.\n\nNonetheless, the judges loved their budget studio apartment (they were running out of money).\n\nTess and Luke split their floor plan into a bedroom, bathroom and kitchenette.\n\n\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s a really big floor plan change,\u201d Shaynna said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good solution to this space,\u201d Darren added.\n\nShaynna had to check the wardrobe and was impressed to find ample storage and even a television in there.\n\n\u201cSo you have got your marble top, your drawers which are practical, but it actually feels like a living room space with the television there,\u201d she said.\n\nThen into the kitchen and \u201cwow\u201d, Neale said, \u201cit\u2019s luxury of a compete different kind\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis a luxury based on functionality which will please a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nShaynna ticked off all the amenities by literally listing everything in her sight from the stove, oven and fridge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s compact, but it works,\u201d Neale added.\n\n\u201cThey have really thought it through. They have gone through the checklist of what the space requires to be self-sufficient and I think there will be plenty of buyers.\u201d\n\nThen into the bathroom they agreed it had great space and the styling was consistent with the bedroom and kitchen.\n\nThe only criticism was Shaynna saying \u201ccontinuity wasn\u2019t their thing\u201d.\n\nBut Neale disagreed, saying Tess and Luke made the rooms (in this reveal) different to the rest of the house on purpose to give off that \u201cself-contained apartment\u201d feel.\n\nHe found it hard to fault. \u201cI think they have really, really thought about the detail of the person using this space,\u201d he said.\n\nThey finished with a score of 29 (technically 28, had they not used their extra point).\n\nHOUSE 4: Matt and El\u2019ise\n\nEven though the judges had a lot to like about Matt and El\u2019ise\u2019 ensuite, it still wasn\u2019t enough compared with the other homes. They came last with a score of 27.5\n\nThe judges said their room had a glamorous vibe but felt the ensuite let it down due to their being no natural light.\n\n\u201cLook at the colour in here,\u201d Shaynna said upon walking into the bedroom. \u201cThey know how to do colour this couple.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreen on green on green. It\u2019s quite regal,\u201d Neale added.\n\nDarren was impressed with the consistency Matt and El\u2019ise achieved with their bedrooms throughout the entire home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a replay of the front bedroom and I think that\u2019s a good thing. It definitely has elements that are very similar, but I think how it comes across the entire floor is very wise,\u201d he said.\n\nNeale loved that it had a nice contrast with classic and ultra-modern feels.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the artwork, they\u2019re really cool and very contemporary, but there is a sense of classicism about the other choices,\u201d he said, referring to the bedside table, lamps and button back, velvet headboard.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s a lovely balance. I was never a big fan of these large, overblown wallpaper artworks, but they\u2019re growing on me.\u201d\n\nShaynna was a big fan of the layout, saying it was absolutely beautiful and felt \u201crestful\u201d because of the natural light. She was all about he natural light in this reveal.\n\nWalking into the walk-in wardrobe, she also loved the amount of storage. \u201cIt\u2019s classy, classic and very simple,\u201d Shaynna said before adding the room had no natural light. There it is again.\n\n\u201cI myself like a bathroom that has natural light, so I have to say even though it looks good, it\u2019s a bathroom I might feel a little claustrophobic in.\u201d\n\nBut on the plus side she liked the wall, floor tiles and the grey basin.\n\nHowever, Matt and El\u2019ise ran out of time to put in ventilation, which was a big no, no and illegal.\n\n\u201cSurely they would realise nobody would put in a bathroom without ventilation,\u201d Neale asked.\n\nWhile he said aesthetically it was a good-looking bathroom, \u201cit\u2019s not exciting\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s slightly generic, but it ticks the boxes,\u201d he said.\n\nIt definitely wasn\u2019t a room that made Shaynna cry.\n\n\u201cBut I do feel good in that bedroom and in the walk-in robe,\u201d she said.\n\nJust not so much in the ensuite.\n\nHOUSE 5: Jesse and Mel\n\nThey were very close to making it a trifecta of wins, but they missed out by half a point, joining Mitch and Mark in second place with a score of 28.5.\n\nThe judges started their tour in the wardrobe where they found some \u201cstunning joinery\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can easily move around in there, there\u2019s lots of storage space and you get a desk/ dressing table,\u201d Darren said looking rather impressed.\n\nShaynna also loved their massive mirror, with Neale saying, \u201cI dare say it, but it spells luxury\u201d.\n\nHeading into the bedroom, Darren loved the ample space.\n\n\u201cWe have got a loungeroom, bedroom area and a massive walk-in wardrobe and ensuite,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a self-contained hotel room. It has broad market appeal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not something you often hear coming from Neale but he said \u201cJesse and Mel are becoming the masters of modern luxury\u201d despite having blasted their style in the past for looking too \u201ccorporate\u201d.\n\nFor Darren, the room lacked the same emotional pull that Andy and Deb\u2019s had \u2014 that is, bringing Shaynna to tears.\n\n\u201cWhile this space is really smart and ticking so many boxes, there\u2019s only going to be a few people lit up emotionally by this aesthetic,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut what it does do is beautifully demonstrate what the space could be, according to Neale.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very good at showing you \u2018look, you can have all this, this can be whatever you want it to be\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat drove Shaynna crazy (her words) was Jesse and Mel\u2019s use of mixed metals, from chrome to brass finishes. It\u2019s something she has been trying to get them to change, but 10 weeks in, it\u2019s safe to say Jesse and Mel are really not taking on-board her feedback.\n\nWhat all three judges did agree on was that the couple\u2019s house was going to appeal to the most number of buyers compared with the other four homes.\n\nSCOREBOARD:\n\nMitch and Mark: 28.5\n\nTess and Luke: 29 used gnome for one point (Winners)\n\nAndy and Deb: 28\n\nMatt and Elise: 27.5\n\nJesse and Mel: 28.5\n\nThe Block airs tomorrow at 7pm on Channel 9", "description": "It\u2019s not a sight you often see \u2014 Shaynna Blaze speechless and in tears \u2014 but there was one room during Monday night\u2019s Block reveal that pulled at the heart strings so bad, she had to take a seat.", "authors": ["Shireen Khalil"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d701fca29bffadb69e2bfca3ae41b425?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
