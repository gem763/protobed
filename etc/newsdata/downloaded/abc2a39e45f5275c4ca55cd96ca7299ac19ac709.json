U.S. and Afghan officials were looking into reports that 40 civilians, including children, were killed in an airstrike that hit a wedding celebration in southern Helmand province. Getty\n\nThe agency went on to say that it had also received \"credible information\" about an additional 30 deaths \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 and was working to further verify these claims.\n\nUS Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) blasted the UNAMA findings, questioned the agency's methodology and insisted its \"precision\" strikes had accurately targeted meth labs.\n\n\"In addition to imagery collection during the precision strikes, USFOR-A conducted exhaustive assessments of the facilities and surrounding areas after the strikes,\" the command said in a statement.\n\n\"Combined assessments determined the strikes did not cause deaths or injuries to non-combatants.\"\n\nTaliban claims deadly attack on hospital\n\nThe US military in 2017 and early 2018 carried out multiple strikes against Taliban opium processing plants, but the efforts had little impact on the insurgents' revenue stream and were unpopular among Afghan farmers, many of whom rely on the poppy crop.\n\nThe military then switched its focus to the more lucrative meth industry.", "description": "UN agency says at least 30 civilians, including 14 children, killed in airstrikes.
