Seconds later, the second teenager wearing a white sweatshirt begins violently punching Bonaventure as he lies on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cHim, who said \u2018get him,\u2019 is in front of me, like, you know, and the two other on the side and punching, but I\u2019m trying to block the punches,\u201d the victim told CBS New York.\n\nBonaventure said he was trying to enter the Cambria Heights Public Library on Linden Boulevard when he noticed the young men standing outside the building.\n\nThat was when they began to chase him. \u201cI fall on the sidewalk and they keep on kicking me on the left side, ribs side there, on the right side and get to my hip, then kicking in my head,\u201d he recalled.\n\nThe victim said he believes the incident was part of a gang initiation because they did not steal his keys, cell phone, or wallet.\n\nEven though the assault happened earlier this month, doctors at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital said Bonaventure is still healing from a broken femur and ribs.\n\nHowever, the Haitian immigrant said he hopes the teenagers will change their ways.\n\n\u201cThis type of action could destroy their tomorrow. I just wish them good luck because I may be living for another two or one decade, one more decade or two decades, but themselves, they have a lifetime in front of them,\u201d he concluded.\n\nOfficers with the New York Police Department (NYPD) are looking for the young men and asked anyone with information regarding the incident to call the Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). For Spanish, call 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).", "description": "An elderly man is still recovering after two teenagers allegedly attacked him outside a library in Queens, New York, on October 10.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/NYPD-officer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
