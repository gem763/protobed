Chang's wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Fox News, a spokesperson for P.F. Chang's said, \"Bill\u2019s right, our team members really do have a good time working at P.F. Chang\u2019s. And while we haven\u2019t been able to locate his application yet, we decided to offer him the job anyway.
