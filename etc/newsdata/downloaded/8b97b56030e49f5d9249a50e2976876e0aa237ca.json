This time on Hack Your City, we got your tips on Barcelona, capital of Catalonia, Spain. There\u2019s some disagreement over just how tourist-friendly the area is; like many popular destinations, there\u2019s some pushback from the locals. So behave respectfully and learn some phrases in Catalan (not Spanish) \u2014 speaking the language charms locals everywhere. Now let\u2019s look at the best tips of the week.\n\n\u201cGet tapas at Bar jai-ca in Barceloneta, then walk around the block and get anything from the bakery Forn Balboa. Maybe the best croissant i have ever had.\u201d \u2014 axleisms\n\n\u201cBe prepared to have lunch at 3pm and dinner at 10pm. Portions are immense and Catalans really take time to enjoy where they are. You can enjoy shopping until 9pm or even 10pm in some places.\u201d \u2014 ted92\n\n\u201cI found a place in the old town called Spritz that just makes Aperol spritz cocktails to go. Not authentic Catalan cocktails by any means, but delicious nonetheless.\u201d \u2014 HappyInParaguay\n\n\u201c Rekons Urgell has really really great empanadas, and lots of different varieties.\u201d \u2014 bartoloscopy\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re there over a whole weekend, start thinking about your Sunday now! Especially, where you\u2019re going to eat. The Catalans have managed to preserve the idea of Sunday as a day to spend with your family so outside of the main museums, the town is closed all day. If a restaurant takes bookings, it\u2019s probably already booked out! And if it doesn\u2019t, you can expect to queue.\u201d \u2014 PooJavelin\n\n\u201cIf you really want that European \u2018superclub\u2019 experience, hit up Razzmatazz. This place is more like a compound than a club, spread over five huge rooms that cater to different genres of music. They also bring in really awesome feature artists. But, fair warning: the doors don\u2019t open until after 2am. and things didn\u2019t even get busy until after 3am.\u201d \u2014 MustardTiger\n\n\u201cSagrada Familia is worth it, but be warned the elevators in the steeples only take passengers up. Be prepared for a lot of stone stairs on the way down.\u201d \u2014 HappyInParaguay\n\n\u201cWhile the Bunkers offer breathtaking 360 views, try the hill at Tur\u00f3 del Carmel. Views are the same or even better, and it\u2019s just a fifteen minutes walk from the Bunkers but unknown to tourists and locals: you will probably be completely alone.\u201d \u2014 casanovaeduard\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thriving English language comedy scene. Check out Hush Hush Comedy\u2019s (generally) twice monthly shows featuring local and touring comedians. And there are other shows and open mics, too.\u201d \u2014 JordanBeck\n\n\u201cMake sure you buy your adult beverages at the convenience store close by Barceloneta Beach, as it is much cheaper than buying it at the beach restaurants.\u201d \u2014 ATLien18\n\n\u201cUnderrated? The Museum of Modern Art. No one goes and it\u2019s insanely beautiful.\u201d \u2014 serrini\n\n\u201cPark G\u00fcell entry is free after dusk, wait until the evening and save some money. Also bring your hiking shoes and trek up the hill behind the park for some gorgeous views of the city.\u201d \u2014 FloridaMan\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in any way photographically inclined, hook yourself up with Foto Ruta; I got a Getty-published guide who took me through the city to places I never would have gone alone, and saw things that absolutely set my shot(s) apart from any I\u2019ve taken before or since. In fact, I have some of those shots hanging in my house I\u2019m so proud of them.\u201d \u2014 brianjgeraghty\n\n\u201cI love the archaeology museum. Not a lot in English, but some great artifacts and easy to get by if you know Spanish.\u201d \u2014 MoonJewel\n\n\u201cMonument to Columbus, 60m tall, probably the best panoramic view in the city. Costs about $9. And it\u2019s not very popular (comparatively), which means that you\u2019re going to get great photos and nobody will be in your way.\u201d \u2014 mfusion\n\nRide Medieval Landscapes. We rode horses through the Spanish countryside to different medieval towns. Did it with no prior horseback experience. David, the host, was super knowledgable and patient and a great cook. The day trip includes a bus ride, pickup from the station, and lunch after the ride. It was an amazing experience & his manor was beautiful. Relaxing by the pool with lunch after the ride was the perfect way to top it off.\u201d \u2014 LP22\n\n\u201cGo to the Picasso museum in the Gothic quarter and then go to the nearby Cat Bar for good beer and vegan food.\u201d \u2014 overthejamesnj", "description": "Before you get on the elevator up the Sagrada Familia, you should know: the only way down is the stairs.
