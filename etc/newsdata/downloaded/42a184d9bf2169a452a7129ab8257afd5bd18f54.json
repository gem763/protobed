After the crisis erupted and developed into an international furor, the players were not made available to the media while they were still in China.\n\nThe rhetoric from James, the world\u2019s most powerful basketball player, is certain to inflame the controversy that has engulfed the league since Morey\u2019s tweet on Oct. 4, an image with the words \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The league in recent years has stressed its support for freedom of speech and encouraged its players to be politically outspoken when they feel it\u2019s necessary. But in his comments, James suggested there are limits.\n\n\u201cWe all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself,\u201d James said on Monday after returning to Los Angeles. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word- or sentence-feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nDrawn by the salary, women flock to trucking.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m out\u2019: PG&E blackouts stagger Californians.", "description": "Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James criticized Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for the tweet that set off a crisis between the NBA and...", "authors": ["Ben Cohen"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT285_lebron_ZG_20191014232235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
