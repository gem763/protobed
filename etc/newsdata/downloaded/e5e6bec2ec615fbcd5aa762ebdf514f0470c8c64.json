This meant that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t know either.\n\nThe email was one of a thread of messages that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained from the Justice Department under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\n\nMr. Trump has claimed that the purpose of Mr. Mueller\u2019s May 16 White House visit was to interview him for the vacant FBI director post. Mr. Mueller, a former FBI director, has said the meeting\u2019s purpose was to discuss the bureau in general.\n\nWhatever the purpose, John Dowd, Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney during the ensuing 22-month probe, said Mr. Mueller had a duty not to meet with the president knowing he was likely to be investigating the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cThe most dishonorable conduct I have ever witnessed,\u201d Mr. Dowd told The Washington Times.\n\nNoting Mr. Mueller\u2019s military service, Mr. Dowd added: \u201cCapt. Robert Mueller, USMC, sits in front of his commander-in-chief being interviewed for FBI director knowing he is going to investigate the president and never says a word.\u201d\n\nThat same day, May 16, Mr. Mueller also visited Mr. Rosenstein at the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cI am with Mueller,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said in an email to Mark Filip, a former deputy attorney general now in private law practice. \u201cHe shares my view. Duty calls. Sometimes the moment chooses us.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Mr. Rosenstein shocked the White House. Without consultation, he announced that Mr. Mueller would take over the Russia probe, launching a historic investigation that would attract of staff of mostly Democratic prosecutors. He gave Mr. Mueller wide latitude to investigate Mr. Trump and his campaign associates, saying \u201cany links\u201d with Russia should be probed.\n\nMay 2017 was a particularly tumultuous month inside the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nMr. Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9. The White House cited a memo written by Mr. Rosenstein on how Mr. Comey crossed the line in announcing no charges against Hillary Clinton for her mishandling of State Department emails.\n\nAghast, Mr. Rosenstein almost immediately began a hunt for a special counsel. His inbox filled with demands from liberal nonprofit groups to appoint one. He didn\u2019t believe he had written the memo to justify a firing.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Rosenstein made his first overture to Mr. Mueller.\n\nAn aide emailed Mr. Mueller\u2019s law firm, WilmerHale: \u201cI\u2019m writing to try to arrange a meeting between Mr. Rosenstein and Bob Mueller, hopefully for Friday [May 12] morning \u2014 anytime before 10 a.m. Can you let me know if Mr. Mueller would have any time? Thanks so much!\u201d\n\nA Mueller assistant replied 24 minutes later: \u201cCan we do it at 8 a.m.? Also would it be possible to get a parking spot for Mr. Mueller inside the building.\u201d\n\nThe night of May 12, Mr. Rosenstein sent the boss-doesn\u2019t-know email to Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Mueller wrote to Mr. Rosenstein: \u201cRod if you have a moment would you please give me a call.\u201d\n\nBy May 16, the deal seemed done. Mr. Rosenstein again met with Mr. Mueller and sent the \u201csometimes the moment chooses us\u201d email. Mr. Mueller spent time that same day with the president. Mr. Rosenstein announced the appointment on May 17.\n\n\u201cThese astonishing emails further confirm the corruption behind Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Robert Mueller,\u201d said Judicial Watch chief Tom Fitton.\n\nJudicial Watch released documents in September about another traumatic event unfolding inside the Justice Department that May.\n\nMr. Rosenstein, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and other aides met to discuss the Comey firing \u2014 the same day Mr. Rosenstein met with Mr. Mueller and Mr. Mueller met with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe group\u2019s suspicions immediately turned on Mr. Trump as a target in the Justice Department\u2019s Russia election interference probe.\n\nIn an astounding discussion, Mr. Rosenstein offered to wear a wire during a meeting with the president to record the conversation and ask him his motivations, according to a contemporaneous memo written by Mr. McCabe.\n\n\u201cHe said he thought this might be possible because he was not searched when he entered the White House,\u201d Mr. McCabe wrote. \u201cI told him that I would discuss the opportunity with my investigative team and get back to him.\u201d\n\nThe wire caper apparently never happened.\n\nMr. McCabe, who would be fired the next year for allegedly lying to investigators about a leaked news story, acted on May 16 to investigate Mr. Trump as a possible Russian spy and election collaborator.\n\nA year later, Mr. Rosenstein discussed how to respond to a 2018 New York Times story about the wire and about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove an incapacitated president.\n\nThe story apparently came from the fired Mr. McCabe. He talked about the incident while selling his book, \u201cThe Threat.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenstein ended up issuing a statement: \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the Department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u201d\n\nMr. Mueller completed his final report in March. While Mr. McCabe implied that Mr. Trump is a Russian spy, the 448-page report offers no such evidence. Mr. Mueller was assigned to find \u201cany links\u201d with Russia by any Trump associate or Mr. Trump himself.\n\nThe Mueller report said: \u201cThe evidence we obtained did not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.\u201d\n\nIn July, Mr. Mueller appeared before two House committees at the insistence of Democrats.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, Texas Republican, asked him about his May 16, 2017, meeting with the president.\n\nAsked whether he planned to investigate Mr. Trump for firing Mr. Comey at the time he was appointed special counsel, Mr. Mueller answered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that. Internal deliberation from the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you talking to him about FBI director position,\u201d Mr. Gohmert asked.\n\n\u201cNot as a candidate,\u201d Mr. Mueller said.\n\n\u201cDid he mention the firing of James Comey in your discussion with him?\u201d the congressman asked.\n\n\u201cCannot remember,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so, but I\u2019m not going to be specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he did, you could have been a fact witness as to the president\u2019s comments and state of mind on firing James Comey,\u201d Mr. Gohmert said.\n\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr. Mueller said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
