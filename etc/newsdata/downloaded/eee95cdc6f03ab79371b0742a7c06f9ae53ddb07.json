His body language screamed \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be here listening to you people\u201d. It was a pose designed to suggest this debate shouldn\u2019t have taken place at all. But it was a mistake \u2013 and one that will haunt him and his party for decades.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, Elector of Hanover (1683 to 1760) Boris Johnson is a Hanoverian, and, thus distantly related to the Queen, David Cameron (via William IV) and Danny Dyer (via Edward III), among others. Boris's paternal grandmother, Yvonne Eileen Williams, known in the family as \"Granny Butter\" and whose family name was de Pfeffel, was a descendant of Prince Paul Von Wurttemberg. The German prince was, in turn, a direct descendant of George II. Discovered by genealogists f other BBC\u2019s Who Do You Think You Are, Johnson commented, in 2008: \"I felt I was the product of newcomers to Britain so it is totally bizarre, surreal in fact, to be told that in fact my Great x 8 Granddad is George II. But don't neglect the point that he shares that distinction with 1,023 others \u2013 there must be several thousand other people out there in the same position.\u201d National Portrait Gallery 2/11 2. The \u201cMummy of Basel\u201d, Anna Catharina Bischoff (1719 to 1787) Last year, scientists in the Swiss city of Basel solved a decades-old mystery over the identity of a mummified woman. DNA extracted from the mummy\u2019s gig toe indicates that the female is a great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of Boris Johnson. The body was uncovered in 1975 while renovations were being done on Basel's Barf\u00fcsser Church, and was buried at the altar, wearing fine clothes, indicating she was at least well-to-do if not nobility. High levels of mercury in her remains suggested she had been treated for syphilis (the metal also helped preserve her). National Gallery of Basel 3/11 3. Ali Kemal (1867 to 1922) (Pictured with wife Winifred Brun) For a man who made so much capital in the 2016 referendum on the prospect of Turkey joining the EU and its 80 million citizens thus enjoying free movement to the UK, Boris Johnson sometimes makes a surprisingly big deal of his Turkish Muslim great-grandfather on his father\u2019s side, who he claims was an asylum seeker. Ali Kemal, according to his famous descendant, came to Britain because it was \u201ca beacon of generosity and openness\u201d. I t might be overstating it, but he did live in exile in England for a time. Unknown 4/11 4. George Williams (1821 to 1905) Sir George, as he became, is the great (x4) grandfather of Boris Johnson, and was one of the founders of the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association or YMCA, in 1841. An evangelical apostle of \u201cmuscular Christianity\u201d, George took it upon himself to organise some fellow drapers and establish a safe place for young men where they could be shielded from the debauchery and the temptations of the flesh and the grape. No sofas would suffer red wine stains in the hostel. Since then it has gone global, today assisting 58 million people across 119 countries, which is almost as many as Boris helps. A social visionary of his time, George was knighted for his works by Queen Victoria in 1894. National Portrait Gallery 5/11 6. King Friedrich of Wurttemberg (1754 to 1816) Though stocky of build, and handy in a game of rugger, Boris Johnson is not especially heavy or tall. This ancestor was. King Friedrich stood 6 foot 11 inches, and weighed 31 stone (2.12 metres/200 kilograms). Napoleon remarked that God had created the Prince to demonstrate the utmost extent to which the human skin could be stretched without bursting. There are rumours that he was bisexual and enjoyed the close companionship of young noblemen. This added to the strains on his marriage to Augusta, who was the granddaughter of King George II. One of their four children, Prince Paul is the link to the Johnsons, via an illegitimate daughter he fathered in Paris with an actor named Friederike Margrethe Porth. Ludwigsburg Castle Archive 6/11 7. Professor Elias Lowe (1879 to 1969) Elias is Boris Johnson\u2019s mother Charlotte\u2019s great grandfather. The distinguished Princeton scholar and student of ancient scriptures (palaeographer) , Elias arrived in the United States as a refugee from Lithuania in 1891, and was affine of Albert Einstein. Jewish, Lowe came for a line of revered rabbis. Although he cannot be counted Hallachially Jewish, the Jewish Chronicle makes him 5 per cent Jewish on their reckoning. Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences 7/11 8. Helen Lowe-Porter (1876 to 1963) Helen Tracey Lowe-Porter. is Boris Johnson's mother Charlotte\u2019s great grandmother. An American, she married the Lithuanian-born academic Elisa Lowe, and is said to have been probably the most prominent literary translator in the English-speaking world working from German to English in the twentieth century. However, not necessarily the best and in such circles her reputation is contested. In any event, she retained for 50 years the exclusive rights to translate the works of her friend Thomas Mann. Her and Elias\u2019 daughter Beatrice is Charlotte Johnson (nee Fawcett\u2019s) mother. Lowe-Porter family 8/11 9. Sir Henry Fawcett MP (1833 to 1884) Before Boris and Jo Johnson became MPs and minsters, there was Sir Henry Fawcett \u2013 Britain\u2019s first blind MP. He was the husband of the famous suffragette Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and thus an ancestor of Boris on his mother\u2019s side - though the family tree isn\u2019t clear on how close they are related. Glasgow University 9/11 10. Prince Paul of Wurttemberg (1785 to 1852) Odd looking, an amusing womaniser (remind you of anyone?), this minor German aristocrat was the progenitor of the Johnson\u2019s posh pedigree, such as it is. His affair with an actress is Paris, Fredericke Porth, gave rise to a daughter (out of wedlock as they used to say) provided the link back to the royal families of Wurttemberg and Hanover, and thus of Great Britain. By the same token it means that Stanley, Boris, Rachel, Leo and Jo, and the rest of them along that branch of the tree, are also distantly related to most of the royal families of Europe including the Russian Romanovs \u2013 Johnson stands connected, albeit tenuously, to the Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Luxembourg, Norwegian and Swedish families, plus the German Kaiser. Paul had five declared children, and two illegitimate ones, at least that are known about. National Archive Holland 10/11 11. Fredericke Porth (1777 to 1860) When, on the BBC show Who Do You Think You Are? Boris Johnson discovered the identity of his 4x Great Grandmother, Fredericke, he was just a touch chauvinist: \u201cAn actress, could be a euphemism we may be about to turn up a prostitute here. Not that I mind. I want you to know they can get up to anything, my ancestors, they have carte blanche to commit whatever acts of fornication they want as far as I am concerned, but I want to know\u201d. It seems Fredericke Margarethe was indeed an actress for most of her life, and was widowed by the time her illegitimate daughter, the product of her affair with Prince Paul of Wurttemberg was born, in 1805. Born Porth, Fredericke was married to a man named Vohs until 1804, and, in 1818, remarried to a man named Werdy. She was described as a \u201cRoyal Saxon Court-Actress\u201d. Alamy Stock Photo 11/11 12. Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847 to 1929) Disappointingly, the ancestor who is sometimes mentioned as a stands as a standing genealogical reproach to Boris Johnson may not be a related at all. As a pioneering feminist and suffragette, she\u2019d surely disapprove of Boris\u2019 attitudes towards womankind. As President of the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), the largest component of the suffragette movement, she did as much as anyone to get women into the political life of the nation, and the Fawcett Society, still fighting for equal human rights, is named in her honour. Millicent lived just long enough to see the vote being granted on an equal basis to all women, and said this when it was finally enacted in 1928: \u201cIt is almost exactly 61 years ago since I heard John Stuart Mill introduce his suffrage amendment to the Reform Bill on May 20th, 1867. So I have had extraordinary good luck in having seen the struggle from the beginning.\u201d Bain News Service/Elliott & Fry 1/11 1.

Every time we\u2019re told how seriously the Conservative Party take the sovereignty of parliament, out it will come. Every time a Tory is accused of lying in parliament, there it will be.\n\nIf you ever got bored of seeing Ed Miliband eat a bacon sandwich, just wait until you see the mileage people will get out of this one. That one picture sums up every prejudice \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 about Rees-Mogg and his Conservative Party: that they are out of touch; that they don\u2019t care about the concerns of \u201clittle people\u201d; that they are lounging on the job while the rest of the country works hard and still suffers. After all, no boss I\u2019ve ever had would take kindly to me adopting a pose like this in the office.\n\nBoris Johnson wants to run his long-planned election as parliament against the elites. What could look more elitist than appearing to refuse to take the job of representing the British people even remotely seriously?\n\nAnd what if Rees-Mogg gets what he wants, as Johnson manages to take Britain out of the European Union without a deal? If that is even one tenth as tough as even the most optimistic positions, his supine figure will be the defining image of a government that put its own desires before the economic health of the nation it led.\n\nIn political campaigns images are essential.
