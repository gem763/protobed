Some explanations for the dinosaurs' disappearance blame clouds of debris and soot that blotted out the sun and cooled the planet, while others say it was noxious gases from worldwide volcanic eruptions, or even a great plague.\n\nasteroid meteor More\n\nAccording to a new study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, global cooling was the culprit.\n\nOn impact, the research found, the Chicxulub asteroid \u2014 which was more than 6 miles wide \u2014 sparked wildfires that stretched for hundreds of miles, triggered a mile-high tsunami, and released billions of tons of sulfur into the atmosphere. That gaseous haze blocked the sun, cooling the Earth and dooming the dinosaurs.\n\nThe dinosaurs fried and then froze, Sean Gulick, the lead author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nExamining the Chicxulub crater\n\nChicxulub_impact asteroid More\n\nDonald Davis/NASA\n\nTo better understand what happened on that fateful day in our planet's history, the scientists behind the new study conducted an in-depth examination of the Chicxulub impact crater \u2014 a challenging feat, given that the crater extends 12 miles into the depths of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nGulick and his colleague Joanna Morgan collected rock samples there in 2016, from a part of the crater in which rock and debris were deposited just after the asteroid's impact. No rocks from that area had ever been extracted before.\n\nGulick and Morgan then spent the next three years analyzing the samples to geologically reconstruct a timeline of what happened after the impact.\n\ncore samples More", "description": "The dinosaurs' extinction was spurred by an asteroid that struck Earth.
