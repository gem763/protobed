Boo.\n\nRed Night Frappuccino\n\nJapan\u2019s copped two (2) limited edition Halloween bevs this year, the Red Night and the Dark Night frappuccino. It comes with a little straw with a tiny masquerade mask (!!!) and the red one kinda looks like you\u2019re sipping on a really heavy strawberry thing, and the dark night actually just looks like a dark choc. I could probably knock these back and not feel like my teeth were going to fall out of my head.\n\nFranken Frappuccino\n\nIt\u2019s choc mint, I\u2019m about it. I\u2019m very about it. Would drink. I\u2019ve seen some people switch out the green tea base with matcha (another green tea but diff flav) and I simply don\u2019t know how to feel about it.\n\nZombie Frappuccino\n\nThe cream whip looking like brains is very cute, but something about it that makes my teeth hurt a little. Apparently it\u2019s a \u2018Green Caramel Apple\u2019 flavour which just seems\u2026wrong? Whatever, I\u2019d give this a go but probably couldn\u2019t get through the whole thing.\n\nWitches Brew Frappuccino\n\nThis one amps up the grot by putting in a clump of chia seeds and I just, wow. No. No thank you. That takes it into a texture land that I simply did not want tickets to.\n\nAlso, why is it bloody PURPLE? Delete this from the secret menu right now.\n\nPhantom Frappuccino\n\nLiterally, nothing about this looks edible. Nothing.\n\nTie-Dye Frappuccino\n\nThere is nobody that\u2019s going to make a tooth-achingly offensive drink better than the Americans. Truly. The Tie-Dye frappuccino from their secret menu is a perfect example of that.\n\nIt looks like it\u2019ll give you an instant headache while also tapping into your long-lost love, the Rainbow Paddlepop. Bet it tastes only like caramel, too.\n\n(Apparently it\u2019s banana flavoured, and that\u2019s fucken DESTROYED my day.)\n\nUnicorn Frappuccino\n\nJust fucken, no. None of this.
