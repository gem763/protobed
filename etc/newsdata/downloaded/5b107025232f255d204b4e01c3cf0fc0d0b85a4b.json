I have felt for many years that AO observations could contribute a lot to this effort.\u201d\n\nThe results have been published in the latest issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nTo ensure that the results were reliable, the researchers went into the research blind: ensuring that they kept the final conclusions hidden as they worked to ensure their measurement was as accurate as possible. That meant that the researchers could avoid the worry that they would unconsciously adjust the findings to ensure that they lined up with expectations.\n\n\u201cWhen we thought that we had taken care of all possible problems with the analysis, we unblind the answer with the rule that we have to publish whatever value that we find, even if it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s always a tense and exciting moment,\u201d said lead author Geoff Chen, a graduate student at the UC Davis Physics Department.\n\nWhen they finally looked at the result, they found that the numbers showed the universe is expanding more quickly than they had thought.\n\nThat in turn could complicate our understanding of the universe under the standard model of cosmology. Researchers generally think that the expansion of the universe was very quick when it first formed, then slowed down as dark matter pulled on it, and is now getting faster because of dark energy.\n\nThat was created by looking at very distant objects, looking into the cosmic microwave background or the radiation that is leftover from the Big Bang whent he universe began.\n\nBut the new study looks at more local objects. Numerous studies have found that there is an unexplained difference between the speed measured from those local objects and the results found when examining distant ones.\n\n\u201cTherein lies the crisis in cosmology,\u201d says Fassnacht. \u201cWhile the Hubble Constant is constant everywhere in space at a given time, it is not constant in time. So, when we are comparing the Hubble Constants that come out of various techniques, we are comparing the early universe (using distant observations) vs. the late, more modern part of the universe (using local, nearby observations).\u201d\n\nThat suggests either that there is a problem with our understanding of the Cosmic Microwave Background \u2013 which researchers think is unlikely \u2013 or that there is something profound and fundamental wrong with our understanding of physics.", "description": "The universe is expanding faster than scientists thought, potentially re-writing our model of the universe.
