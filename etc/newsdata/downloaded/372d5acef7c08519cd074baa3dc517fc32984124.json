The temperature was above 50 degrees Celsius as it was not being cooled with air pumps.\n\nParts of the mine that are considered unsafe were supposed to be cordoned off.\n\nWith an official investigation underway, Fin24 outlines the reactions so far to the deaths of the five miners.\n\nSibanye-Stillwater\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of news of the deaths of five miners, Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s James Wellstead inspired an backlash when he seemingly blamed workers for the spike in deaths at the company and claimed that people were \u201ctaking risks and not following safety procedures,\u201d according to the Bloomberg.\n\nCriticised by trade unions and MPs in the mineral resources oversight committee, the company has softened its stance.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, CEO Neal Froneman said the company was \u201cappalleld\u201d by the loss of life.\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot rectify the harm that has occurred, we will continue to support the families as best we can in their grief. The safety of employees is our primary concern and, if it is not safe to operate, we expect conditions to be fixed before work can resume at a working place,\u201d said Froneman.\n\nHe added that the recent spate of deaths was \u201cunparalled\u201d in the firm\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept that lives are lost in extracting minerals from the earth, and we will leave no stone unturned in restoring a safety performance that meets our expectations,\u201d Froneman promised\n\nTrade Unions\n\nAccording to trade unions, Froneman is the reason for Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s dismal safety record, with the Association of Mineworkers & Construction Union (Amcu) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) accusing him of arrogance.\n\nThe NUM has asked for the Department of Mineral Resources to suspend Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s license, with its spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu blaming Froneman\u2019s \u201cholier-than-though attitude\u201d.\n\nAMCU, meanwhile, has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene and wants to see the Health and Safety Act amended to give more power to miners and trade unions to address safety issues.\n\nMineral Resources Committee\n\nMPs visited Sibanye-Stillwater on Tuesday to hold discussions with the management, trade unions and the officials from the Department of Mineral Resources.\n\nMineral Resources Committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo told Fin24 \u201cthe way things are now, Sibanye [is] becoming a threat to the right to life\".\n\nThe four unions at Sibanye-Stillwater - NUM, AMCU, Solidarity and the Uasa union - will work on crafting a consolidated report of the reasons they believe are behind the fatalities. They will present it to the oversight committee on July 19, without management present.\n\nLuzipo also expressed concern about the \u201cattitude of management\u201d saying they need to find a system which ensures owners and shareholders are held accountable for the loss of life, not just operational executives.\n\nDepartment of Mineral Resources\n\nAfter a press briefing on Sunday where he unveiled the revised Mining Charter, Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe tweeted \u201cit cannot be business as usual\u201d with regard how the department - as the regulator of the mining industry - responds to the spate of fatalities.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about rocks, it\u2019s about people\u2026if you ignore human beings, you\u2019ll have no mining,\u201d Mantashe warned.\n\nHe promised to provide updates once the investigation has been completed. Spokesperson for the department Ayanda Shezi confirmed on Tuesday that the probe was still underway.", "description": "With the death toll this year alone at Sibanye-Stillwater operations reaching 20, Fin24 looks at the reactions to the deaths of five miners at the Kloof Ikamva shaft near Westonaria.", "authors": ["Tehillah Niselow"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7097/773999d1b4cc4833b4758c203aa66936.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-21"}
