Leaving the house is a MAJOR thing for me. Evenings, into London, really difficult...\n\n'It\u2019s an anxiety thing and maybe I\u2019ve always been like it (not ideal for the showbizzyb*****ks-thing, admittedly). It can hardly be called work when people invite you and are super bloody lovely and kind...\n\n'But it\u2019s how it is). Having my hair down because it was the compromise in my Brexit negotiations with one of the Ungratefuls, in exchange for wearing a giant, black bin bag and no heels. #thekidsareincharge'.\n\nGood night? The Gladiator presenter, 52, donned a all-black ensemble yet ruined her chic look by pulling a host of animated expressions while leaving the venue just hours\n\nShe recently caused shockwaves when she discussed having sex only one time with ex-husband Brian Monet during eight years.\n\nAnd discussing the shock admission further as she appeared on the Tuesday instalment of Loose Women, Ulrika confessed that the situation escalated to the point that she feared she would 'die without being intimate again.'\n\nThe presenter, who finalised her divorce from her third husband in June, also revealed she only tried to 'instigate' intimacy 'few times because she couldn't bear the rejection.'\n\nSpeaking to the panel, Ulrika explained her previous confession that she only had sex with Brian once during eight years\n\nHappy days! She was beaming as she stepped out in the chic black ensemble but appeared to have overindulged\n\nShocker: The presenter, who finalised her divorce from her third husband Brian Monet in June, also revealed she only tried to 'instigate' intimacy 'few times because she couldn't bear the rejection'\n\n'I was obviously profoundly affected by it and, to be quite honest, wondered if there was other people going through similar things. Mine, I guess, also coupled with going through the menopause and feeling different about my own body.'\n\nWhen asked if they were both disinterested in sex, she admitted that was certainly interested.\n\nShe said: 'Obviously my ex-husband is not here to defend himself. I tried very, very hard at increasingly regular intervals to bring the subject up, it was of great concern to me.\n\n'We worked really well as a couple and as parents and as a family, I think it was amazing. It was 100% the reason I wanted to stay in the marriage and keep going.'\n\n'Thought he was having an affair': Ulrika explained she also tried to instigate conversation as to why he didn't want to be intimate (Pictured 2009)\n\nEarlier on: She posed up a storm inside the venue while rocking her leather look\n\nHowever, Ulrika detailed her concerns about being knocked back.\n\n'I probably only instigated it a few times because I couldn\u2019t bear the rejection. When you sort of hope that something might happen, it could just be that those signals weren\u2019t picked up on \u2013 maybe I wasn\u2019t crazy raunchy enough or whatever it is \u2013 for me it genuinely wasn\u2019t about sex, it was about intimacy.'\n\nUlrika explained she also tried to instigate conversation as to why he didn't want to be intimate: 'No, I don\u2019t know [what his reasoning was].\n\nStruggle: Prior to the event, Ulrika took to social media to detail her outing as she penned: 'So, here\u2019s the deal. Leaving the house is a MAJOR thing for me'\n\n'For me that genuinely feels like I don\u2019t know whether he didn\u2019t want to tell me, I don\u2019t know, he might have gone off me, or whether he didn\u2019t know himself. I genuinely don\u2019t know. I definitely haven\u2019t had an answer on that.\n\n'The fleeting thought that you mentioned that I thought about asking my husband for an affair, I had that mad thought in absolute desperation.\n\nWhen asked directly if she did go ahead and look into the possibility of an affair, Ulrika expressed: 'No, I didn\u2019t feel that. That sounds really arrogant doesn\u2019t it, like, \"Of course not\".", "description": "The Gladiator presenter, 52, donned a all-black ensemble yet ruined her chic look by pulling a host of animated expressions while leaving the venue", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/07/19775310-0-image-a-15_1571208753938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
