As long as the intermediate-term indicators are not overbought or are still rising, that should be the case.\n\nAnother aspect of this view is that it is unusual for the intermediate-term indicators to roll over concurrent with the major indexes. What is more common is that we rally into a short-term overbought condition, then we pull back and rally again. It is during that subsequent rally that, if there are divergences in the market, they will show up.\n\nWill breadth stay strong? Will the intermediate-term indicators continue to rise? Those are some of the things I look for on that subsequent rise. Not to mention what sentiment will do.\n\nIn March, the market got short-term overbought and we pulled back and rallied again into late April. In late April, the intermediate-term indicators began to diverge by going down, while the big cap stock indexes rallied. Then came May's decline.\n\nIn mid-July, the major indexes continued to rise while the intermediate-term indicators rolled over. Then came August's decline. It's not always that easy or precise, but that's the general gist of how the indicators ought to work.\n\nSo where are we now? Well, I left earlier this week, and the S&P 500 was at 2992 and it is now at 2984, which would seem like not much of anything. But the McClellan Summation Index stopped going up for the first time in a month. It will only require a net differential of positive 500 advancers minus decliners to turn it back up, but it is now possible we could start to see the first negative divergence with this indicator.\n\nWhat also happened was that the number of stocks making new lows on Nasdaq moved up to triple digits. The only good news is that Nasdaq had 102 new lows on Tuesday and on Wednesday Nasdaq traded about 30 points lower (than it did on Tuesday) on an intraday basis and the number of new lows remained at 102. So what's the problem? Take a look at the 10-day moving average of new lows for Nasdaq: it's rising.\n\nYou can see the mid-July rise in this indicator, as well as the gradual rise off the March low.\n\nThe final issue is sentiment. The Investors Intelligence bulls crawled over the 55% level to 55.1% this week. Now this survey is as of last Friday, so it is entirely likely that it comes right back down next week, but once over 55% it is in complacent territory. What's more is that bears fell to 16.8%, which is the same low level they were at in mid-July.\n\nWe will see the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey on Thursday morning.\n\nI expect the bulls to fall this week since this survey should encompass Tuesday's decline. Either way, it's not as though the sentiment numbers show much fear right now.", "description": "The S&amp;P numbers may appear like nothing much is happening, but look below the surface at the new lows and the McClellan Summation Index, for the full story.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Here Are Indicators You Should Be Watching", "The S P Numbers May Appear Like Nothing Much Is Happening", "But Look Below The Surface At The New Lows", "The Mcclellan Summation Index For The Full Story.", "Bruce Kamich", "Ed Ponsi", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d6f60b16-cdee-11e9-848d-2d179648d2b7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
