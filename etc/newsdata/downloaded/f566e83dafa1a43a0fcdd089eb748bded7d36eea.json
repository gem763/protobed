A recent gut renovation to this West Village, Manhattan, apartment also removed the dining room walls and floor-to-ceiling built-in shelves (along with the tower of knick-knacks required to fill them).\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s left is a decluttered, loft-like space styled with owner Shawn Henderson\u2019s particular brand of restrained sophistication. Mr. Henderson, a New York-based interior designer who has decorated homes for Will Ferrell, Glenn Close and filmmaker Tate Taylor, is putting the one-bedroom co-op apartment on Greenwich Street up for sale this week, asking $1.6 million.\n\n\n\nMore: A 1,086-Acre Estate in the Heart of Connecticut\u2019s Rural Litchfield County\n\n\u201cVirtually every surface in the apartment was touched,\u201d said Mr. Henderson, 47. \u201cThe only thing original to this space are the pine floors.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even those the designer restored to their knotty natural state by stripping away a layer of orangey lacquer.\n\n\n\nDesigning his own place offered an opportunity to experiment in a way he can\u2019t with clients, said Mr. Henderson\u2014who purchased the unit three years ago for $1.15 million, according to property records.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a little laboratory,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA wall of floor-to-ceiling closets in the bedroom offered one such test, where he installed an in-unit washer and dryer that needed some form of ventilation. The solution was to build the wall of closets with louvered doors, a scheme he\u2019s now replicating for a client, he said.\n\n\n\nThe biggest structural change was knocking down a wall between the living and dining rooms.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had anticipated putting that back up,\u201d Mr. Henderson said. \u201cBut when I came for a site inspection, I saw how wide open that was.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also carved up what used to be an awkwardly placed den between the kitchen and bedroom into a powder room for guests, a small office and a sizeable walk-in closet.\n\n\n\nA walk-in closet Michael J. Franco//Compass Real Estate\n\nThe final result is an airy open-floor plan suited to entertaining in the front two-thirds of the apartment and an amenity-rich bedroom suite at the back, which can be hidden away via a sliding pocket door.\n\n\n\nHe chose a mixture of textures to break up the otherwise clean white walls, including painted exposed brick, grey oak cabinets and honed marble countertops, according to information from the listing agent, Michael J. Franco of Compass Real Estate.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: How Wealth Managers Are Attracting the Ultra Rich\n\nThere are also exposed wood ceiling beams and a strictly decorative fireplace in the living room. The master bathroom also features marble finishes and unlacquered brass taps.\n\n\n\nMr. Henderson said he\u2019s selling as part of a move to the Gramercy Park area. He\u2019s found a new apartment with a large outdoor space where he intends to hone a \u201csecret\u201d obsession with landscaping.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a gratifying thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can work on it for a few hours and have a finished product, unlike designing a couch and having to wait 12 weeks.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-116847?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
