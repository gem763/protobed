(Photo: Paras Griffin, Getty Images for Tyler Perry Stu)\n\nTamron Hall is clearing the air after it was reported she revealed she used to \"facilitate\" selling cocaine as a teenager with her college boyfriend.\n\nU.K. tabloid The Daily Mail first reported that Hall made the comment during a taping of her talk show on Tuesday, which producers edited out.\n\nThe former \"Today\" host issued a statement to People and Entertainment Weekly in which she denied dealing drugs.\n\n\"I never dealt drugs,\" Hall said. \"I am now nearly 50 years old and was reflecting on a bad judgement call that could have turned worse.\"\n\nShe said that she was sharing a story from her teenage years about a bad situation she got herself into during an interview with prison rights advocate, Topeka Sam. Hall's interview with Sam aired on Wednesday as part of a segment on Cyntoia Brown.\n\n\"It was part of an open and honest conversation about women, incarceration and mistakes made,\" Hall added.\n\nShe said a portion of her segment was edited from the show for \"legal reasons.\"\n\n\"I hope my show can be a forum for sharing stories without shame or judgment, including a conversation we\u2019re having Friday on opioid addiction,\" Hall said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hall's representatives for comment.\n\n\"The Tamron Hall Show\" premiered Sep. 9 two years after she left NBC's \"Today\" show after losing her 9 a.m. hour with Al Roker to make way for the short-lived \"Megyn Kelly Today.\"\n\n\"I was heartbroken,\" Hall says of her decision to exit. \"(Imagine) you've been putting in the work, and suddenly your employer says they're phasing you out. I had some suspicions, because I'm a reporter and I'm pretty intuitive, but no one wants to lose their job. It wasn't about who I was losing it to \u2013 it was like a relationship where you're putting in 100% and the person who's putting in less has the nerve to break up with you.\"\n\nTamron Hall talks 'Today' show exit: Tamron Hall was 'heartbroken' by 'Today' exit, promises 'authentic' daytime talk show\n\nContributing Patrick Ryan\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/18/tamron-hall-denies-selling-cocaine-teenager-following-tv-segment/4020177002/", "description": "Tamron Hall issued a statement in response to the Daily Mail reporting that she confessed to facilitating the sale of cocaine as a teenager.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
