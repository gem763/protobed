Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, according to the three people who have been briefed on it.\n\nMr. Volker spent Thursday on Capitol Hill being questioned by House investigators as Democrats pursued their impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. He disclosed a set of texts in September in which Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, alluded to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision earlier in the summer to freeze a military aid package to the country. He told Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d", "description": "Two American diplomats drafted a statement for Ukraine\u2019s new leader that would have committed him publicly to the inquiries Mr. Trump has been seeking into political rivals.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
