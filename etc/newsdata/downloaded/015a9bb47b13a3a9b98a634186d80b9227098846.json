They got a game worth watching, too, the first upset of the World Cup, as Uruguay beat Fiji 30-27, despite being nine places below them in the world rankings.\n\nIt was Uruguay\u2019s first World Cup win in 16 years, and only their third ever. Given the others were against Georgia in 2003 and Spain in 1999, this must rate as the greatest game they\u2019ve ever played.\n\nFiji, on the other hand, are now all but out of the World Cup after two defeats in five days. Only two teams in the tournament\u2019s history have ever made it through to the quarter-finals after losing two pool matches. They were abject, tired, sloppy, and complacent. They made almost as many handling errors as they managed to score points.\n\n\n\nUruguay led 24-12 after a ring-a-ding first half. They scored three tries in that time, and were within an inch of securing a bonus point with a fourth, too. Fiji, who\u2019d made 12 changes to team that lost to Australia on Saturday, scored two of their own, both from short range off the back of scrum penalties which they kicked into touch.\n\nScott Fardy on rugby in tsunami-hit Kamaishi: \u2018It was like the end of days\u2019 | Andy Bull Read more\n\nIn between, Uruguay scored their first after they swept up a loose ball, spilled by Leone Nakarawa as he tried a wildly ambitious offload. Scrum-half Santiago Arata wriggled, slipped, and squirmed through three tackles on his way to the try line.\n\n\n\nManuel Diana scored Uruguay\u2019s second off the back of a line-out, after Juan Manuel Cat had charged down Alivereti Veiotakani\u2019s clearance. Cat got the third himself, after a spectacular offload by Rodrigo Silva.\n\nThe move started with another bit of poor play by the Fijians, after Semi Radradra left a high kick that was seized by Uruguay\u2019s full back, Gaston Mieres. Radrada almost gifted them a fourth with another loose pass, which Andres Vilaseca hacked downfield. The two of them raced each other to the ball as it bobbled over the line, but the replays showed Vilaseca had just knocked on as he dived for it.\n\nFiji made a worse mistake right after the half, when Tevita Ratuva blew a three-on-one by passing the ball straight to Uruguyan instead of a teammate. Then Josh Matavesi missed a simple penalty attempt.\n\nHe missed a conversion minutes later, after Api Ratuniyarawa bullied his way over for Fiji\u2019s third, was even worse. Uruguay never did get that fourth try. But it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe two penalties Felipe Berchesi kicked in the second half put them eight points ahead, even after Nikola Matawalu scored a fourth try for Fiji. Even though Matawala got a fifth in the very last minute, it still wasn\u2019t enough to prevent defeat.", "description": "The South Americans collected their first World Cup win in 16 years while Fiji were left staring down an early exit after two defeats", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a7ae152353308d4f42ecc50c9ef676c39097c7/0_150_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1dbd8448db268227207f98e94e27654", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
