I love you too.\"\n\nFans were gutted by the twist, but were happy to have mention of Stacey after so long.\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays at 8pm, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One .", "description": "EastEnders' Stacey Fowler is yet to return to Walford, but was heard talking in a scene in the latest episode", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Warning", "Use Of This Copyright Image Is Subject To The Terms Of Use Of Bbc Pictures' Digital Picture Service", "Bbc Pictures", "As Set Out At Www.Bbcpictures.Co.Uk.
