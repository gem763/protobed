It was the 314th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.\n\nAs part of the country's high-definition Earth observation project, the microwave remote sensing satellite is capable of providing photographs with a ground-level resolution of less than a metre.\n\nGaofen-10 will be used in land survey, urban planning, road network design, crop yield estimate, as well as disaster relief. It can also serve key national strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe satellite and the carrier rocket were both developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.", "description": "China has successfully launched an observation satellite from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/89/16/1000x563_cmsv2_4914849f-bdbc-5391-ab51-70c6a30ebf2b-4208916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
