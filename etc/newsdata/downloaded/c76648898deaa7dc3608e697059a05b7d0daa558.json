To earn the full 200,000 miles, your business needs to spend $50,000 in the first six months. If you're a freelancer or have a smaller business, that might not be realistic, but for larger enterprises it could be easy \u2014 in which case this offer is a great way to maximize your spending.\n\nOnce you sign up, you'll need to spend $5,000 within three months of account opening to earn 50,000 miles worth $500 in travel.

Since this card offers flexible travel credit, you can use your rewards to \"erase\" travel purchases from your bill at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nIn other words, you would simply use your credit card to pay for travel purchases like hotels or flights, then cash in your rewards to cover all or part of your travel purchases. However, the rules state you have to redeem points for travel expenses within 90 days of the purchase being made.\n\nAlso note that, like the Capital One\u00ae Venture Rewards\u00ae Credit Card, the Spark Miles for Business now lets you transfer points to 15 different airlines.
