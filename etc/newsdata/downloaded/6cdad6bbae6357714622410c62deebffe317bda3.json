Johnson took over from her six weeks ago with a promise that his more robust approach would force a better deal out of the EU that would satisfy parliament.\n\nThe 21 Conservative rebels who now face expulsion from the party include Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Britain\u2019s World War Two leader Winston Churchill, and two former finance ministers - Philip Hammond and Kenneth Clarke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an election, but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop negotiations and compel another pointless delay to Brexit, potentially for years, then that would be the only way to resolve this,\u201d Johnson told parliament after the vote.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that we are tonight tabling a motion under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.\u201d\n\nECONOMIC DISRUPTION\n\nIn an historic showdown between prime minister and parliament, Johnson\u2019s opponents said they wanted to prevent him playing Russian roulette with a country once touted as a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability.\n\nThey argue that nothing can justify the risk of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit that would cut economic ties overnight with Britain\u2019s biggest export market and inevitably bring huge economic dislocation.\n\nJohnson cast the challenge as an attempt to force Britain to surrender to the EU just as he hopes to secure concessions on the terms of the divorce, helped by the threat to walk out without one. Ahead of the vote, he said would never accept another delay to Brexit beyond Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cParliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause tomorrow\u2019s bill would hand control of the negotiations to the EU.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s government will now seek to hold a vote on Wednesday to approve an early election, most likely on Oct. 14. This would pit the avowed Brexiteer against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran socialist.\n\nIn the Brexit maelstrom, though, it was unclear whether opposition parties would support such a move - which requires the support of two-thirds of the 650-seat House of Commons.\n\nCorbyn has long demanded an election as the best way out of the crisis, but many of those seeking to prevent a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit say Johnson could time the poll to ensure that parliament cannot prevent an Oct. 31 departure - with or without a deal.\n\nAfter the vote, Corbyn told Johnson that he must get the Brexit delay bill that will be discussed on Wednesday passed before trying to call an election.\n\nDIVIDED KINGDOM\n\nThe 2016 Brexit referendum showed a United Kingdom divided about much more than the European Union, and has fuelled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and modern Britishness.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons in London, Britain September 3, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Roger Harris/Handout via REUTERS\n\nIt has also triggered civil war inside both of Britain\u2019s main political parties as dozens of lawmakers put what they see as the United Kingdom\u2019s fate above that of party loyalty.\n\nJust as Johnson began speaking, he lost his working majority in parliament when one of his own Conservative lawmakers, Phillip Lee, crossed the floor of the House of Commons to join the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe pound, which has gyrated to the twists and turns of Brexit since the 2016 referendum and is highly sensitive to the prospect of a 'no-deal' exit, had briefly dipped as low as $1.1959 GBP=D3 before the vote in parliament. Barring a minutes-long \"flash crash\" in October 2016, sterling has not regularly traded at such low levels since 1985. [GBP/]\n\nFears of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit were rising elsewhere.\n\nThe European Commission said such a scenario was a \u201cvery distinct possibility\u201d and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was the most likely scenario.\n\nIn a document seen by Reuters, the European Commission set out proposals to be published on Wednesday to provide financial help for EU businesses, workers and farmers if Britain crashes out of the bloc without any agreement.\n\nIt restated its view that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 divorce would hit the British economy much harder than that of the EU.\n\nThe U.N. trade agency UNCTAD said it would cost Britain at least $16 billion in lost exports to the EU, plus a further substantial sum in indirect costs.\n\nThe U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said an election would make a no-deal Brexit more likely.\n\nGraphic: Parliament\u2019s active sitting days (here)\n\nGraphic: Process of no-confidence vote (here)\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nGraphic: Plummeting pound (here)", "description": "British lawmakers defeated Boris Johnson in parliament on Tuesday in a bid to prevent him taking Britain out of the EU without a divorce agreement, prompting the prime minister to announce that he would immediately push for a snap election.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425879574&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821W6"}
