Boris Johnson\u2019s ruling Conservatives have lost their majority, and with it their ability to govern; Parliament has been suspended; and the country is weeks away from crashing out of the European Union, its closest neighbor and largest trading partner, without a withdrawal deal. In normal times, this moment would present a prime opportunity for a united and organized opposition to step in. But these are not normal times, and there is no such opposition party waiting in the wings. Instead, there is the Labour Party\u2014and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cOur movement is strong, our movement is vibrant,\u201d Corbyn told hundreds of party faithful at an opening rally of Labour\u2019s annual conference in this English coastal town over the weekend. The Labour leader pledged to lead the party into an election \u201cagainst a prime minister who wants to take us over the cliff out of the EU and into the arms of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having any of that,\u201d he said amidst roaring cheers. \u201cYou\u2019re not having any of that.\u201d If ever an opposition was needed in Britain, it\u2019s now. Still, voters remain largely wary of the Labour leader, and what his elevation to the country\u2019s highest political office could mean for its future. Corbyn is the most left-wing leader the Labour Party has seen in decades, and his plans for the country, if elected, are equally as radical: The 70-year-old has pledged to oversee a revolution of the British economy, complete with the nationalization of public services such as intercity rail, water, and mail delivery, as well as the reversal of a decade of painful public-spending cuts imposed following the 2008 financial crisis. The Financial Times concluded that this program would cost hundreds of billions of pounds, and constitute \u201ca fundamental redistribution of income and power.\u201d But for all the attention that has been given to what a Corbyn government would mean for the future of Britain\u2019s economy, relatively little has been paid to the potentially seismic impact it would have on Britain\u2019s role in the world. Corbyn\u2019s foreign-policy views are unlike those held by any other Labour leader, and are in many ways outside the mainstream of his own party, let alone the country. While any major economic plan would require Parliament\u2019s consent, as prime minister, he would have significant sway over the country\u2019s foreign agenda at a time when Britain\u2019s global standing post-Brexit is still mired in doubt.\n\nCorbyn ascended to the Labour leadership in 2015, after more than 30 years on the backbenches of British politics. More a political activist than a career politician, he spent much of that time establishing himself firmly within the far left of the Labour Party, advocating on issues ranging from nuclear disarmament (which he supports) to unilateral military intervention (which he has long opposed). Considered among the party\u2019s most rebellious members, Corbyn has voted against the Labour Party in Parliament more than 500 times. His transition from the fringes of the party to the very top came as a surprise to many, including Corbyn himself, and heralded a significant leftward shift in what had otherwise been a center-left party. Corbyn was boosted by thousands of new (mostly young) voters attracted to his message against public-spending cuts, as well as his decades-long tenure as an anti-war activist, including his opposition to Britain joining the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. It also marked a rejection of the more centrist \u201cBlairite\u201d politics ushered in by former Prime Minister and Labour leader Tony Blair, with whom Corbyn has long been at odds. It was precisely because of Corbyn\u2019s far-left credentials that many presumed his leadership bid didn\u2019t stand a chance. Commentators dismissed him as a \u201cmaverick\u201d candidate of the \u201cloony left,\u201d while Conservatives cheered his candidacy as a way of ensuring that Labour would be consigned to \u201celectoral oblivion.\u201d Even those within Labour who helped get Corbyn onto the ballot admitted they had no intention of voting for him, with several lawmakers saying they only lent him their support to broaden the leadership debate. In the end, Corbyn secured the backing of nearly 60 percent of party members, but only 10 percent of Labour parliamentarians.\n\nRead: Why Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t fighting Brexit Since then, Corbyn has transformed Labour into a party in his own image: one that is unwaveringly anti-austerity, antiestablishment, anti-war, and crucially, stronger in number. Labour membership swelled from 200,000 members at the time of Corbyn\u2019s election to upwards of half a million\u2014nearly four times that of the Conservatives\u2014in just two years. Though the surge in members didn\u2019t prove enough to secure Labour\u2019s electoral victory when former Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election in 2017, the party was able to deny the Tories the outright majority May had been hoping for. \u201cWhatever the final result,\u201d Corbyn declared at the time, \u201cour positive campaign has changed politics for the better.\u201d Things haven\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing for Labour since the election, though. Over the past year, the party has suffered a string of resignations by its more centrist lawmakers and the loss of tens of thousands of card-carrying Labour members over its handling of anti-Semitism allegations within its ranks, as well as the party\u2019s ambiguous position on Brexit. Though the Labour Party formally backed the campaign to remain in the EU during the 2016 referendum, Corbyn\u2019s own efforts to campaign in favor of EU membership were regarded as considerably lackluster. After all, the Labour leader had a long history of skepticism toward the EU, which is viewed by many on the far left as a capitalist club. Indeed, Corbyn voted against Britain\u2019s entry to the European Economic Community (the precursor to the modern bloc) in 1975, and opposed the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties in 1993 and 2008, respectively, which established the EU\u2019s further powers.\n\n\u201cHis instincts are much more euroskeptic than that of even [his] close allies,\u201d Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, and a former senior special adviser to previous Labour Foreign Secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett, told me. Corbyn\u2019s differences with party colleagues highlight the gulf within Labour over its Brexit policy\u2014between those like the leader, who view the EU with suspicion, and those who see the bloc as guaranteeing some measure of basic workers\u2019 rights and regulatory standards. The party was finally able to coalesce around a position this month, pledging to hold a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal (including, were it able to form a government, one of its own), with an option to remain in the EU on the ballot. But there is less consensus on which side the Labour Party would ultimately support. While several of Corbyn\u2019s colleagues have already come out in favor of backing remain regardless, Corbyn himself has signaled he will stay neutral. The first time I saw Corbyn in person, I very nearly didn\u2019t. It was the eve of Labour\u2019s 2018 party conference, in Liverpool, and a group of approximately 50 people had gathered outside the conference venue in Royal Albert Dock to hold a vigil for those affected by a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Standing in the center of them all was Corbyn, who\u2014flanked by Labour\u2019s foreign-affairs spokesperson, Emily Thornberry, and the comedian and political activist Eddie Izzard\u2014decried the Conservative government\u2019s continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which has led a years-long bombardment of Yemen. (Such arms sales have since been ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal in London.)\n\n\u201cIf it were a Labour government \u2026 we would bring about an end to that conflict,\u201d Corbyn told the crowd, which enthusiastically gathered around the Labour leader for a photo. With no security, no police, and minimal press, the gathering was evocative of classic Corbyn: the lifelong anti-war activist, campaigner, and trade-union organizer. And in many ways, through years of challenges to his leadership, accusations of anti-Semitism, and criticism of his Brexit policy (or lack therof), that is the Corbyn who remains in place to this day. Those who know the Labour leader say that many of his views, particularly on issues of foreign policy, haven\u2019t fundamentally changed since he joined Parliament, let alone since he became Labour leader. \u201cWhen I think back, I changed my position on some issues when I learned more about them or as the circumstances changed,\u201d Mike Gapes, a former Labour lawmaker who entered Parliament with Corbyn in 1983, told me. \u201cMost of Corbyn\u2019s foreign-policy positions are identical today to what he always had: A pro-Castro, pro-Ch\u00e1vez, anti-imperialist view of the world.\u201d Read: The implosion of Jeremy Corbyn Gapes was among the group of Labour parliamentarians who resigned en masse in February to protest the party\u2019s lack of leadership on Brexit, and its failure to tackle its anti-Semitism crisis, as part of a largely stillborn attempt to form an independent political grouping. But Gapes, who previously represented Labour in Parliament\u2019s foreign-affairs committee, said he had another reason, too: opposition to Corbyn\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe general tenor of British foreign policy since the 1945 Labour government has been to establish the Western alliance, to support NATO, to be very much regarding the United States as our main ally,\u201d Gapes said, adding that a Corbyn government would ensure those principles were \u201cdirectly challenged.\u201d Much of what a Prime Minister Corbyn\u2019s foreign policy might look like is based on views that he has supported throughout his time in Parliament. An early sponsor of the Stop the War Coalition, a British campaign group founded following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Corbyn was a vocal opponent of the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as subsequent military interventions in Libya and Syria. He has voiced support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including a right of return for all Palestinian refugees. He has also expressed sympathy for the reunification of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (a particularly controversial position for a would-be prime minister, because Northern Ireland remains a part of the United Kingdom). Tom Kibasi, the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a progressive London-based think tank, told me many of Corbyn\u2019s foreign-policy views are in line with mainstream opinion. \u201cMost of the public don\u2019t think bombing children in Yemen is a particularly good thing \u2026 Most of the public don\u2019t think oppressing the rights of Palestinians is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour\u2019s foreign policy is controversial to the chattering media class, but to normal, ordinary people, it\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nBut some of the Labour leader\u2019s views have gotten him into trouble in the past. Corbyn has referred to the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u201cfriends\u201d (comments he has since disowned) and likened the actions of the Israeli government to that of the Nazis (comments that he also later condemned). He has called for the disbandment of NATO, dubbing the international alliance a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein,\u201d and opposed foreign intervention in Venezuela, Syria, and Ukraine, leading critics to suggest he has lent support to oppressive regimes in Caracas, Damascus, and Moscow. More recently, Corbyn faced backlash from both sides of the House of Commons for his reluctance to blame Russia for its role in the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury last year. While many of Corbyn\u2019s views are well established, less clear are his views on some of the biggest foreign-policy challenges Britain will face, from grappling with a rising China to balancing ties between the United States and the EU\u2014though the Labour leader has frequently criticized the Conservative government on matters of domestic policy, he has rarely spoken out on these foreign-policy issues. And then there is the question of how his known views will translate into policy were he to lead Britain\u2019s next government. Though prime ministers have significantly more latitude to make foreign-policy decisions, there are limits to what can be done unilaterally. \u201cThe prime minister has to obtain support from his cabinet and indeed his party in Parliament,\u201d Chalmers, the deputy director general at RUSI, said. \u201cThere are some red lines the parliamentary party would simply not accept, which would threaten the viability of such a government.\u201d\n\nNATO membership would likely be one such red line\u2014even as Corbyn has refashioned Labour, the party apparatus largely remains deeply committed to Western defense and security institutions. (Thornberry has publicly said Labour is committed to the defense alliance.) Continued support for Britain\u2019s nuclear-weapons system, Trident, would be another. (The party\u2019s defense spokesperson, Nia Griffith, has said the party supports maintaining Britain\u2019s independent deterrent.) So far, Corbyn has been willing to acquiesce on those issues. Though he has expressed support for scrapping Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal and has personally opposed the continued funding of Trident, he pledged to honor the party\u2019s decision to maintain the program, a promise that featured in the party\u2019s 2017 election manifesto. Corbyn\u2019s position on using nuclear weapons isn\u2019t simply hypothetical. As prime minister, one of the first things he would be required to do is write his four letters of last resort, handwritten instructions to Britain\u2019s military leaders on what should happen in the event that Britain is hit with a nuclear attack. When asked whether Corbyn could go about limiting the country\u2019s nuclear capacity another way\u2014say, by instructing the military not to employ nuclear weapons under any circumstances\u2014Chalmers said we\u2019ll likely never know. \u201cThe impact of [letters of last resort] can be overstated, not least because the tradition is they\u2019re never publicized,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt would be a test, I think, of whether Jeremy Corbyn was prepared to obfuscate on this in a way which previous prime ministers have done \u2026 It\u2019s more about how he would talk about it, rather than the actual letter.\u201d Related Stories Britain\u2019s Political Chaos Shows Everything Is Okay\n\nBoris Johnson, Brexit, and Britain\u2019s Constitutional Quagmire\n\nWhy a \u2018Brexit Election\u2019 Will Make Things Worse\n\nIt\u2019s Too Late for David Cameron to Apologize But perhaps the greatest impact a Corbyn premiership would have on Britain\u2019s foreign policy is on which direction Britain decides to go post-Brexit, and whether it chooses to align more closely with its allies in Europe, with the Trump administration in the United States, or elsewhere. While both May and Johnson have prioritized courting President Donald Trump with the hopes of securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States, Corbyn has taken a more aggressive stance toward the American president, opting to skip a state dinner during Trump\u2019s visit to Britain this year. (The Labour leader did, however, request a one-on-one meeting with Trump, which the president declined.) Despite the long-standing \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the U.S. and Britain, much divides the two allies\u2014particularly on issues such as climate change, trade, and the Iran nuclear deal. Though these differences haven\u2019t proved enough to hinder the two countries\u2019 deep defense and security partnership, some believe a Corbyn premiership would impose unprecedented strain on the alliance. A recent report by the Washington-based Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, concluded that Corbyn\u2019s apparent willingness to countenance friendlier ties with Russia, Iran, and China would make Britain less of a \u201creliable partner\u201d to the U.S., and called into question the country\u2019s continued membership in NATO and Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance between the U.S. and Britain, as well as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \u201cThere is a serious risk that any information passed to either Corbyn or his close allies could be compromised,\u201d the report said, labeling the concerns a bipartisan issue. \u201cEven a Democratic administration, if it wins the 2020 elections, will find the U.K. has become a less predictable ally.\u201d", "description": "The Labour Party leader could be the country\u2019s next prime minister, and could well redefine its role in the world.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/corbyn_FINAL/facebook.jpg?1569016523", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
