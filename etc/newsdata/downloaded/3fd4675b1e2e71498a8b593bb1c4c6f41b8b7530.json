Get Me Out Of Here! and ITV bosses are hard at work behind the scenes roping in the biggest and best stars.\n\nAnd with the phenomenal success of last year's show - hosted temporarily by Holly Willoughby (who was standing in for Ant McPartlin) and Declan Donnelly - the 2019 series is set to be better than ever with the jungle reunion of Ant and Dec .\n\nFrom the looks of things, the line-up will be a cracker, with Ant and Dec finding out who's going in and sharing their hilarious reactions on social media.\n\nCasting celebrity executive Micky Van Praagh and her team revealed how they go about choosing celebs.\n\n\"It's very early days, but we've already started casting,\" she said at a BAFTA Masterclass for I'm A Celebrity this summer.\n\n\"I think we know what works. I think of our show as a comedy and so I'm looking for people who are funny and high energy as we know those types of things always work.\"\n\nShe added: \"But otherwise you want to do something completely different every year. You're never looking for the next Harry Redknapp or the next John Barrowman or the next Fleur East. You've got to do something different.\"\n\nCreative director Richard Cowles told the same crowd that I'm A Celebrity goes out of its way to create harmony in camp, unlike other shows like Celebrity Big Brother , which focuses on conflict.\n\n\"We have never casted for conflict - if arguments go on for too long it can get a bit dull and relentless,\" he explained.\n\n\"We will always try and cast for warmth and for people to get on. But we want it to be as stressful as it can be because that's when you see people's true colours and how they would react.\"\n\nI'm A Celebrity 2019 rumoured line-up\n\nOlivia Attwood\n\n(Image: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\nThe newly engaged reality star found fame on Love Island 2017, and ever since has been building her career through the likes of TOWIE, Celebs Go Dating and even last year's IAC Extra Camp.\n\n\"There have been conversations with I'm A Celebrity. It's ongoing. It would be my dream to do the jungle. I've made no qualms about that. It's such an iconic show,\" she told the Daily Star.\n\n\"Going out there gave me a taste for it. I got to do a trial, which was amazing. I think if I got to go on the show I would surprise people. I'm more of a tomboy than people think. Just because you look a certain way doesn't mean you can\u2019t eat a spider.\"\n\nWise words.\n\nAmy Hart\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAnother Love Islander who has thrown her cork-covered hat into the ring is Amy Hart, who was part of this summer's crop of Love Islanders.\n\nThe former air stewardess walked out of the villa after being dumped by Curtis Pritchard, who then started making a move on Maura Higgins. Amy was left sobbing after telling the professional dancer she had fallen for him.\n\nAnd, in a recent chat with Heart Dance Breakfast, Amy admitted she'd jump at the chance of going into the jungle.\n\n\"I would love to. I'd absolutely love to. I hate rats. I hate rats. That's the only thing. Like I can deal with the spiders and stuff, I can deal with all the creepy crawlies but it's the rats,\" she said.\n\n\"They put me in that coffin with rats.\"\n\nPeter Crouch\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFormer England footballer Peter Crouch has had quite the year of it, welcoming his fourth child with wife Abbey Clancy in June and releasing his autobiography to critical acclaim.\n\nThe ex-striker already jokingly refers to himself as a \"former footballer\" and seems to be looking for his next big challenge.\n\nHe even joked last year about the show when Harry Redknapp was on it, tweeting: \"Can I just state on record pls . I am not a luxury item #imacelebrity.\"\n\nCould this be the year we finally see Crouchy performing the Robot under the jungle waterfall?\n\nBrendan Cole\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nThe former Strictly Come Dancing professional left the BBC under something of a dark cloud after 14 years.\n\nHe said at the time: \"This is quite hard to talk about. The BBC haven't renewed my contract \u2013 we get renewed year on year \u2013 and they made an editorial decision not to have me back on the show.\"\n\n\"I'm a little bit in shock. I'm quite emotional, a bit raw about it.\"\n\nBrendan was then passed over as Len Goodman's replacement, but the head judge spot eventually went to Shirley Ballas.\n\nHe's currently appearing on The X Factor: Celebrity, but that hasn't ruled him out of jungle speculation.\n\nRonnie O'Sullivan\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe snooker champion turned down a place in the line-up last year, choosing instead to focus on the UK Championship tournament.\n\nBut he wouldn't rule out a stint in the jungle in the future.\n\n\"I was invited but I decided to put it on the back-burner. I'm sure in time I\u2019ll give it a go,\" he said in December 2018.\n\n\"Maybe they can move this tournament. I'll come flying in like Tarzan from Australia to York with my thong on.\"\n\nTheresa May\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBritain's former prime minister is sitting pretty in the wake of being ousted from power - and having to hand over those Brexit negotiations to yet another Tory fool.\n\nBut she may well do a Nadine Dorries and slip away from the beleaguered House of Commons to do the preferable option of chowing down on some exotic genitals for three weeks.\n\nTezza wouldn't be the first politician to sign up for the jungle - but she'd certainly the one with the most f**k-ups under her belt.\n\nNadine Coyle\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nGirls Aloud star Nadine Coyle is the latest signing for the celebrity jungle, according to reports.\n\nThe Irish singer, 34, would be a fascinating watch as she could reveal secrets about the band's acrimonious split and her feud with Cheryl.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Nadine is a big name and ITV was keen to get her.\n\n\"Her link to Cheryl makes her an even more exciting prospect.\n\n\"It's no secret there\u2019s no love lost between them, and Nadine is refreshingly honest about what went on from her perspective.\n\n\"And I'm a Celebrity could well be the start of something big again for her.\"\n\nLove could even be on the cards for Nadine when she enters the jungle, as she recently split from her boyfriend of 11 years, footballer Jason Bell.\n\nUlrika Jonsson\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nFresh from the heartbreak of her third divorce, the 52-year-old TV presenter has been at the centre of I'm A Celeb rumours.\n\nShe appeared on Loose Women in early October wearing a camouflage jacket - which was immediately seized on by the panel.\n\n\"Are you wearing camouflage because you're going into the jungle by any chance?\" asked Kaye Adams\n\n\"I didn't even think about that,\" Ulrika laughed\n\n\"That's the rumour that you're going into the jungle,\" said Ruth Langsford.\n\n\"Yes, the rumour made its way to me as well - somebody said and my kids were really excited and I said, 'Couldn't I do something like Strictly?' And they went, 'No, that's for old people', which is rude, but no, I don't know anything about the jungle, hate to dispel that myth,\" Ulrika added.\n\nHmm!\n\nRoman Kemp\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCapital FM DJ Roman is a strong contender for the jungle and is believed to have saved up his annual leave to cover his time Down Under.\n\nRoman - the godson of George Michael through his mother Shirlie Kemp - has been signed up on the strength of his \"quirky personality\", which bosses believe will make him a great addition to the cast.\n\n\"Roman is a fun, loquacious young star and super-well-connected. He must have countless showbiz tales about his pals,\" a source told the Sun.\n\n\"If he chose to reminisce about George, that could be quite emotional.\"\n\nPiers Morgan\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nPiers has previously announced he'd be only too happy to stroll into the jungle camp - for the bargain fee of \u00a310million.\n\nThe Good Morning Britain host could well take three weeks out of his daytime job of winding up Susanna Reid to chow down on various animal orifices, as Dec has already suggested.\n\nAt the Royal Television Society, Dec told Susanna: \"There is a guy who sits in this seat next to you who has said he would do it for a certain amount...\n\n\"Piers has said he would do it for a certain amount of money, which I think we could meet, but he keeps on wriggling out of it.\"\n\nIf ITV manage to dig around under the sofa and get enough cash to win Piers over, he'll be the most expensive campmate EVER after 2018's series took on Noel Edmonds for a cool \u00a3600,000.\n\nMyles Stephenson\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nSince splitting from girlfriend Gabby Allen, Myles's showbiz star has been... let's say 'on the wane'.\n\nSo if the jungle bosses come knocking, could the X Factor singer snap up the chance to redeem himself in the public eye?\n\n\"Myles is a free agent now and so he can't wait to go to Australia and get away,\" an insider told the Sun.\n\n\"It's a physical and mental challenge and he's really looking forward to testing himself.\"\n\nJames Haskell\n\nBeefy rugby ace James Haskell would provide a big chunk of that much-needed jungle eye candy - only problem is the show could run way over its air slot if the cameras are unable to stop filming him under the waterfall.\n\nJames retired from his pro career in May 2019 and has announced plans to move into MMA fighting from early 2020 - so he could be tight for time if he doesn't want to lose those #gainz.\n\n\"They have made him a decent offer and are hopeful he will sign up,\" a source told the Sun.\n\nAnd with his close relationship with Richard Madeley - he's married to Richard and Judy's daughter Chloe Madeley - there could be a deliciously awkward peek into their inlaw bond.\n\nMaura Higgins\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nMaura won hearts and minds (and probably a few other body parts that a family newspaper will not be naming) in this year's Love Island.\n\nDespite losing out to Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea, Maura was one of the most popular stars in the villa.\n\nShe's currently still coupled up with Curtis Pritchard, but ITV could well be eyeing her up for a stint in the jungle thanks to her huge pull with audiences.\n\nOne cheeky fan even slid into ITV's Twitter DMs asking how many retweets it would take to sign her up - and they replied with an easy \"10,000\".\n\nJennifer Metcalfe\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nThe Hollyoaks bombshell's name has come up as a possible to enter the jungle amid rumours her soap character Mercedes McQueen will be killed off.\n\nThe 36-year-old's Hollyoaks role is the very sassy and glam Mercedes - so it will be a big change for Jen going back to basics and living among the creepy crawlies.\n\nJennifer is no stranger to a challenge and has appeared on Dancing On Ice, lasting seven weeks in the competition and embarking on a relationship with her professional partner Sylvain Longchambon.\n\nThe mother-of-one is now married to Geordie Shore star Greg Lake, who will no doubt be supporting her through all the gruesome Bushtucker Trials if she goes in.\n\nSummer Monteys-Fullam\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe former girlfriend of Paul Hollywood fuelled speculation that she could be starring in this year's series after liking two Instagram posts urging her to make an appearance.\n\nBarmaid Summer was thrust into the spotlight last year when her 30-year age gap romance with the Great British Bake Off judge was made public.\n\nBut since their bitter split in September, single Summer has continued to grab headlines and - according to sources - is hoping to market herself as a social media influencer.\n\nShe even took to Instagram to respond to rumours she might be heading to the I'm A Celeb jungle.\n\n\"Just to set the record straight... I have never contacted or been contacted by the celebrity jungle.\n\n\"Neither have I accepted, received or rejected any offers,\" added.\n\nCould there still be time for bosses to sign up Summer?\n\nAlan Halsall\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nCoronation Street actor Alan had made no secret of his desire to prove himself on I'm Celeb.\n\nJust a few weeks before the show kicks off, Alan teased fans that this could be his year with a less than subtle post.\n\nThe 37-year-old soap star, best known for playing Tyrone Dobbs, shared a snap of him enjoying the great outdoors while dressed in hiking boots, a waterproof jacket and carrying a rucksack on his back looking remarkably similar to one of ITV's famous campmates.\n\n\"It's a jungle out there,\" wrote Alan in the caption - followed up by a telling winking emoji.\n\nIn a Q&A with fans last year, Alan was asked: \"Who are you hoping goes into the jungle?\" one asked him.\n\nHe replied: \"Me, I would smash it.\"\n\nJohn Bercow\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow has the near impossible task of keeping MPs in order - but could he do the same with a group of diva celebs in the jungle?\n\nAfter announcing plans to quit his day job this week, fans of the ITV reality show have been crying out for him to make an appearance.\n\nBookmakers have offered odds as short as 4/5 for the Speaker to attempt to\n\nJohn wouldn't be the first Bercow to brush with reality TV - his wife Sally entered the 2011 Celebrity Big Brother House.\n\nNor would he be the first politician, with Lembit \u00d6pik , Nadine Dorries and Edwina Currie all having competed, as well as Boris Johnson's father Stanley Johnson .\n\nRichard Madeley\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nAfter vehemently denying rumours he'd take up the chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing, bookies have slashed the odds of Richard Madeley cropping up in the jungle to 3/1.\n\nThe veteran presenter said he'd be too embarrassed to appear on national television in full Lycra gear but could he be more comfortable in a Croc Creek camp uniform?\n\nRichard, 63, has already proved himself by attempting replica Bushtucker Trials on spin off show Extra Camp.\n\nIn 2017 he breezed through the trial that boxer Amir Khan famously failed at.\n\nViewers will remember Amir screaming in terror before yelling out: \"I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\" when he grabbed a snake rather than a key during the Critter-cal Rescue task.\n\nBut Richard took the challenge in his stride and completed it with ease - collecting every single key.\n\nDuncan James\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nBlue singer Duncan James would be the third member of the boyband to appear on I'm A Celebrity .\n\nThe singer-turned-actor will head Down Under later this year when the show returns to our screens, according to reports.\n\nBut there's a big problem facing the 41-year-old.\n\nHe has a huge fear of snakes and is well aware that producers will make him come come face-to-face with the reptiles after previously confirming his phobia.\n\nIan Wright\n\n(Image: X01095)\n\nArsenal football legend Ian Wright is said to be in the running for this year's I'm A Celeb.\n\nIt's reported the 55-year-old former striker and football pundit is in \"advanced talks\" for the show.\n\nIt's said if the logistics with Ian's busy schedule can be worked out, then he'll definitely be jetting Down Under.\n\nFrancis Rossi\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nStatus Quo frontman Francis Rossi, 70, is reportedly being lined up by bosses for the show.\n\nExecs are said to believe he'll hit all the right notes with viewers in the same way that last year's champ, football manager Harry Redknapp, 72, did.\n\nA show source said: \u201cFrancis would be the perfect successor to Harry. They are both Londoners with the gift of the gab and a wealth of brilliant anecdotes to tell.\n\n\u201cFrancis has worked alongside all the greats and would win over a new generation of fans by appearing in the jungle.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Jossa\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nEx-EastEnders star Jac hasn't been working much since her shock soap exit, so the Jungle could be the perfect place for her to relaunch her career.\n\nThe mum of two, who is married (somewhat rockily) to former TOWIE star Dan Osborne, is rumoured to have previously turned down stints on Celebrity Big Brother and Strictly Come Dancing so she could focus on raising her daughters.\n\nBut with Dan frequently hitting the headlines for his behaviour in public, perhaps it's time for Jacqueline to spend some time in the spotlight by herself...\n\nJames Lock\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTOWIE star Lockie, who is currently dating his co-star Yazmin Oukhellou, has bragged of his ability to survive the jungle.\n\n\"I'm A Celebrity is something I've always wanted to do and I think I would boss it in there,\" he told OK! magazine this year.\n\n\"Throw it all at me - spiders, snakes, crocodiles. I'll take them all on. The only thing I don't like is rats and tight spaces.\"\n\nCraig Charles\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRed Dwarf and Coronation Street star Craig has already been in the jungle once before, entering in 2014 for just four days.\n\nTragically, the actor was forced to withdraw after learning his brother Dean had died of a heart attack back home in the UK.\n\nCraig was given an emotional send-off by his campmates, with most of them in tears as they hugged him goodbye.\n\nEvery year since, Craig is rumoured to be re-joining the line-up so he can have a proper stint in the jungle.\n\nCould 2019 finally be his year to shine?\n\nGeorgia Harrison\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThis year's IAC line-up could be pretty Love Island-heavy, if these rumours are anything to go by.\n\nGeorgia found fame in the 2017 series where she dated co-star Sam Gowland, and went on to bag herself a role in The Only Way Is Essex and MTV show The Challenge.\n\nShe's previously been linked to Stephen Bear and recently treated herself to a new chin - so the Jungle could be an excellent place to show it off.\n\nJamie Laing\n\nFollowing the success of Georgia 'Toff' Toffolo, who was crowned Queen of the Jungle back in 2017, fellow Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing is tipped to follow in her footsteps.\n\nAccording to a source close to Jamie, he's been telling friends about secret talks with producers about appearing in camp after having been a regular guest on the ITV2 spin off show in the past.\n\nAn insider told The Sun: \"Producers love that he has got a TV following and online fans with his own YouTube channel, as they are trying to snap up a younger audience.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a cheeky chappie and no doubt the public will fall in love with him like they did Toff.\u201d\n\nStacey Dooley\n\n(Image: Phil Lewis/WENN.com)\n\nThe documentary maker has already walked away triumphant from one reality series, and after her recent headline-grabbing antics, ITV bosses could be hoping Stacey proves a winner in the I'm A Celeb ratings stakes too.\n\nStacey, 32, has been dubbed the 'Strictly snake' after ditching her boyfriend of five years and coupling up with her Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton.\n\nBut now she could be meeting the real thing later on this year with her betting odds falling to 3/1.\n\nAs part of her Stacey Dooley Investigates series, the presenter has been plunged into a whole manner of perilous situations, so facing Ant and Dec at the Bushtucker clearing should be no trouble for Stace.\n\nJenny Powell\n\n(Image: 5 STAR)\n\nAfter having been off TV screens for a while, presenter Jenny Powell has admitted she's ready for a new challenge.\n\nAnd what could be more problematic than being thrown into the Aussie outback with a bunch of hungry celebs and creepy crawlies?\n\nIn an interview with Closer magazine, mum-of-two Jenny teased the idea that she'd be heading out to Australia later this year.\n\n\"I was asked to do I'm A Celeb! before and turned it down - however, I'd feel at home with it now,\" said Jenny.\n\nThe telly star said she's hoping to try out more reality TV after a successful stint on Channel 5's Celebs On The Ranch.\n\n\"I just loved the experience. It sounds cheesy, but it was more than making TV. It was a journey and I'm so glad I did it,\" gushed Jenny.\n\nGemma Collins\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nThe GC herself has already had one shot at I'm A Celeb glory, but pulled out just three days into her jungle stint in 2014, citing her \"yellow poo\" and starvation.\n\nShe hadn't even made it into the main camp at the time, and had refused to get in the helicopter as she was scared of heights.\n\nBut the 37-year-old TOWIE star reckons now that she's in a better mindset to face the critters - and said she's ready to try again.\n\n\"I was meant to go back in the jungle the year after I came out,\" she told Loose Women in 2018.\n\n\"Do you know what, if it come back again, why not, why not? I would probably be terrible at all the tasks and all that.\"\n\nIn March 2019, she admitted to Jonathan Ross that she was verging on desperate to be put back in.\n\n\"If I was to go back now... I\u2019ve got a lot more experience. I've got a tougher skin now and I think that\u2019s where The GC came into play.\n\n\"If they asked me back, yes I'd go back.\"\n\nKatya Jones\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nStrictly Come Dancing professionals have a long history of success on I'm A Celeb, and Katya could be set to follow in their elegant footsteps after her conduct on last year's BBC series.\n\nShe and her husband Neil Jones were embroiled in a love triangle after she was papped snogging her partner Seann Walsh in the street - which both of them dismissed as a boozy night out.\n\nBut Seann's then-girlfriend Rebecca Humphries was heartbroken and dumped him days after the pictures emerged. Katya and Seann were voted off Strictly three weeks later.\n\nWhile Katya and Neil have fully made up and say their marriage is back on track, could Katya be yearning for a bit of excitement Down Under?\n\nShe has been included in the list of professional dancers set to return to Strictly this year, but bookies reckon she's got a good chance of throwing in the sequinned towel and hot-footing it over to Australia.\n\nDanny Dyer\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nEveryone's favourite 'ardman Danny Dyer has been rumoured for IAC for years - so could 2019 be his chance to shine?\n\nHe recently admitted to Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain: \"You know me Piers, I've done a bit of reality TV.\"\n\nAnd with his daughter Dani winning last year's Love Island with ex-boyfriend Jack Fincham , Danny Snr could see this as the perfect time to 'ave a little toe-dip in the reality waters.\n\nDani Dyer\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYes - like father, like daughter, as Love Island's newly single pringle could turn her attention to getting her hands on the jungle crown.\n\nUnlike her dad, Dani is more accustomed to the trials and tribulations of reality TV, and by refusing to have sex in the villa set herself up apart from the usual trashy comments levelled at reality stars.\n\nThe 22-year-old aspiring actress has already done Survival Of The Fittest, Celebrity Gogglebox and Danny Dyer\u2019s Right Royal Family - and with Strictly's unwritten ban on inviting reality stars, the jungle could be beckoning for young Dani...\n\nKym Marsh\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nSoap star Kym recently revealed she's leaving Coronation Street after 13 years to concentrate on other projects.\n\nAnd she appeared to heavily hint about an upcoming jungle stint in a Good Morning Britain appearance, cheekily saying \"never say never\" to getting the I'm A Celeb call.\n\nBut Kym has already signed up to perform in Elf the musical later this year, which starts in December, which makes getting to and from the jungle pretty unlikely...\n\nLucy Fallon\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nCoronation Street's Bethany Platt has had a pretty wild couple of years on the soap, but actress Lucy has already bigged up her jungle skills.\n\n\"I think I'd be good at the jungle. I like to challenge myself and that's the most challenging show you can do,\" she said in 2018.\n\nHmm!\n\n\n\nMichael Le Vell\n\n(Image: David Hartley/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nCorrie's Michael was in talks with I'm A Celebrity bosses for the 2018 series, after the sex abuse allegations he was cleared of in 2013 left him with crippling legal fees.\n\nHe didn't make it into the jungle last year - but TV chiefs could well be looking at shelling out the big bucks for such a soap legend, no doubt hoping he'll spill the beans about his back story.\n\nKate Garraway\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBefringed GMB presenter Kate was another star lined up for 2018, but reportedly \"dropped out\" because it wasn't \"the right time\" - with insiders insisting she was \"not ruling it out forever\".\n\n\"Kate is no longer taking part \u2013 she didn't want to be out of the UK for a long time and it's just not the right time for her to take part,\" one source said at the time.\n\n\"She's a big fan of the show so she's not ruling it out forever \u2013 just this year!\"\n\nIt was hoped the veteran presenter could be ratings gold, just as she is on GMB.\n\nJohn Barnes\n\n(Image: Channel 5)\n\nJust like soap stars, footballers tend to do well on the gruelling three-week show.\n\nAnd John Barnes would be well up for taking a leaf out of his mate Harry Redknapp's book, telling the Jonathan Ross Show: \"From the point of view of eating anything, I eat everything and anything, so from that point of view I would do it.\n\n\"Lying around doing nothing much, I quite fancy so I'd probably look at it as a bit of a holiday. I would do it, yeah.\"\n\nJohn Terry\n\n(Image: George Wood)\n\nThe former England ace has done a season at Aston Villa as assistant coach - but that doesn't mean he can't be lured Down Under with a giant cheque.\n\nJohn's another star with a colourful past - especially his fling with Wayne Bridge's then-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel - so bosses would be sure to get him plenty of air time.\n\nFrankie Bridge\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne potential campmate who might have a few issues with John Terry is Frankie Bridge, however - she's now married to his former best friend Wayne.\n\nThe ex-Saturdays singer has already done Strictly and Celebrity Masterchef, plus watched as Wayne made it almost all the way through to the final of I'm A Celeb 2016.\n\n\"I think now Wayne's done it and he loved it and he said he would do it again, it kind of makes me feel positive that I would enjoy it,\" she admitted in 2018.\n\nGeorgia Steel\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nAs one of the most irritating Love Island stars to have ever existed, Georgia Steel is keen to get stuck in to even more reality telly after her Celebs Go Dating experience.\n\nThe loyal star, who's just, like, so loyal? is single once again after leaving the Island for Sam Bird, and hasn't had much luck in the romance stakes since.\n\n\"I would love an opportunity like that as I think it would be amazing,\" she told the Express in 2018.\n\n\"It would be very scary though. Of course, anything is possible\u2026\"\n\nCould her inclusion in the camp be just what the show needs?\n\nEyal Booker\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nEyal is another Love Islander rumoured to be joining the line-up this November, thanks to his heavy hints.\n\n\"I'd love to go into the jungle, or The Island with Bear Grylls,\" he told Radio Times.\n\n\"I'd like to do a show away from dating where I'm more into my natural environment, in nature. I'd like to do lots of jumping around and crazy activities.\"\n\nHe added that one of the projects in his pipeline involved \"animals\", laughing: \"I can't tell you too much about it but it's me more in nature, back in my natural environment, doing my thang.\"\n\nNadiya Hussain\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBake Off winner Nadiya has seen tremendous success since being handed the special cake stand - but she wants more.\n\n\"I'd love to do the jungle though, if I was offered,\" she told Lorraine Kelly recently.\n\n\"I like being dirty and mucky and like the idea of living in the outdoors, flying out the planes.\"\n\nRahul Mandal\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nNadiya's fellow Great British Bake Off winner Rahul won the nation's hearts with his softly spoken self-deprecation and his incredible edible delights.\n\nCould he follow in Nadiya's footsteps? Bookies seem to think so, offering odds of 2-1 on Rahul jetting off to Oz.\n\nRosie Marcel\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHolby City actress Rosie confirmed last year she'd been in talks with ITV about taking up a place in the jungle.\n\n\"I've had a couple of meetings. I have spoken to them, it is something I would love to do actually,\" she said in 2018.\n\n\"I think for me it would be an amazing challenge.\"\n\nOlivia Buckland\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nLove Island's Olivia has had a frantic year, having married her love Alex Bowen in a romantic fairytale wedding.And it seems she's got her sights set on the jungle crown, having admitted last year: \"I'd love to do I\u2019m A Celebrity, and I'd love to meet Holly.\n\n\n\n\"I've met Holly a couple of times but to do that on I'm A Celeb and if Ant and Dec could make a comeback I'd absolutely adore that,\" she went on.\n\n\"I love them two and I watched them when I was younger so to be next to them doing something ridiculous, that would be epic.\"\n\nStephanie Waring\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHollyoaks and Dancing On Ice veteran Stephanie has also previously spoken of her love of the show, revealing in 2018: \"I've always wanted to do the jungle, I'm scared of everything but I'd like to be in Australia.\n\n\"There are no pressures from the outside world, no TVs and no phones and I think it's a real test of inner strength which has always appealed to me,\" she added.\n\n\n\nAlexandra Cane\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nYet another Love Islander is rumoured for IAC's 2019 line-up - this time unlucky in love Alex, who won over fans after she was dumped by Dr Alex George in the villa.\n\nBut she reckons she'd be far more successful in the jungle - even if only in the food department.\n\n\"I know I'm A Celeb don't like Love Island people but I'm determined!
