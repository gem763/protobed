Taylor additionally accused Brown of sexual assaulting her in June 2017.\n\nThe athlete has denied the allegations through his attorney.\n\nAhead of the news, Brown was released from the Oakland Raiders over the weekend, then quickly signed with the New England Patriots, which is giving the athlete a one-year contract worth up to $15 million, Brown\u2019s agent Drew Rosenhaus confirmed to ESPN.\n\nOn Sunday, NBC Sports reporter Al Michaels claimed Rosenhaus told him that \u201cBrady told Brown to \u2018Come move in with me until you get settled into New England.\u2019 \u201c\n\nCraig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty; Christian Petersen/Getty More\n\nAnd in a Monday interview, Brady was asked point-blank if he had extended the offer.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have asked a lot of guys over the years to stay at my house,\u201d Brady said to Westwood One Sports. \u201cSome have taken me up on it and others haven\u2019t. I just want this transition for him to be really smooth. It\u2019s been a lot of travel to go from the West Coast to the East Coast. And again, learning the playbook. I just want him to be comfortable. Whatever\u2019s up to him, I\u2019m totally cool with.\u201d\n\nAlso in a Monday interview with WEEI, Brady said of Michaels\u2019 comments, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of things said on TV. I didn\u2019t say that to anyone publicly.\u201d\n\nReps for Brady declined to comment further, but a source tells PEOPLE that the invite would have been \u201call about the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is framed by the team and winning and that\u2019s how they operate,\u201d the source explains, further noting that Brady and wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen used to \u201chave a welcome to Boston BBQ at the beginning of the season\u201d for new Patriots.\n\nRELATED: Antonio Brown Released from Oakland Raiders After Whirlwind Offseason, Signs with Patriots\n\nIn response to the allegations this week, the Patriots said in a statement provided to PEOPLE, \u201cWe are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed earlier today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio\u2019s representatives. We take these allegations very seriously. Under no circumstance does this organization condone sexual violence or assault. The league has informed us that they will be investigating. We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s attorney Darren Heitner released a statement denying \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d made against the athlete, stating, \u201cHe will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations.\u201d\n\nHeitner went on to claim that Taylor approached Brown in 2017 after he signed a contract, \u201cmaking him the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL.\u201d\n\nHeitner claims Taylor asked Brown to invest $1.6 million dollars in a business project she was working on. When he refused, Heitner explained that\u2019s when the two cut ties.\n\nThey reconnected again in 2018 when Taylor offered to train Brown for the upcoming NFL season, Heitner said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the accuser engaged Mr. Brown in a consensual personal relationship,\u201d Heitner claims. \u201cAny sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual.\u201d", "description": "Tom Brady Told Antonio Brown He Could Stay with Him: Report", "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qmqayz1j5Fx1Z40HX0xOqg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/0f527215ddbe51f95da10fa6e644027f", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
