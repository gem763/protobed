I\u2019m actually in an exclusive relationship for quite some time, and it\u2019s going really well, so I\u2019m happy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked whether she wants children in her future, Rihanna replied: \u2018Without a doubt.\u2019\n\nShe also told Anna Wintour in a Q&A that she wasn\u2019t putting a time on having a baby, explaining: \u2018I don\u2019t think about stuff like that but\u2026 God\u2019s plan \u2013 but I look forward to all of the pregnancy rumours after this interview.\u2019\n\nRihanna has been dating businessman Hassan Jameel (Picture: Naim Chidiac)\n\nTeach us your ways, RiRi (Picture: Splash News)\n\nRihanna later defended Anna for asking the question, explaining to Extra: \u2018Anna just wants to know what the people want to know!\n\n\u2018A lot of women get very defensive. It\u2019s personal. It\u2019s our bodies. And, of course, it\u2019s our time.\u2019\n\nThe singer, real name Robyn Fenty, hadn\u2019t previously officially confirmed her rumoured relationship with Saudi Arabian businessman Hassan, so her words are a rare insight into the side of her life fans rarely get to hear about.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not surprised Rihanna\u2019s chilled about starting a family, given that she\u2019s pretty busy basically taking over the world, one Fenty line at a time right now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
