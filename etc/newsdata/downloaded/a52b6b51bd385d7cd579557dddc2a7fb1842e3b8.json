The Opelika-Auburn News reported that Auburn is in charge of the construction of the project, but is splitting the cost with Opelika. Daily upkeep will be Auburn\u2019s responsibility, but renovation and repair costs will be split between the cities. The park is being built at the site of some former tennis courts at Indian Pines Golf Course. The goal is for the park to be completed by early next year.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: An escaped goat that eluded authorities for nearly two days was caught after a hunt involving requests for public assistance and sightings shared on social media, officials said. The goat was in the custody of Fairbanks North Star Borough Animal Control on Tuesday night, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported. The male goat was reported missing Monday morning. Animal control officials asked the public to contact a law enforcement phone number in a social media post that was shared more than 500 times. Two state troopers transported the animal after the goat was caught by people near a road \u201cjumping into traffic and causing some concerns,\u201d said Ken Marsh of the Department of Public Safety. Facebook users who followed the chase updates named the goat Curry. The owner, who was not identified, planned to initially return the goat to the herd \u201cso he can heal from this experience. The herd he grew up in will bring him some comfort,\u201d Fairbanks animal control operations manager Sandy Hill said.\n\nArizona\n\nChinle: The Navajo Division of Transportation has closed Chinle Airport\u2019s runway until further notice because of existing asphalt deterioration. Authorities said the division\u2019s Road Maintenance and Airports Management departments assessed the Chinle Community Airport on Monday. They said the assessment indicated that the south end of the runway has deteriorated significantly; large cracks exist, precipitation is leaking through the cracks into the subgrade and the existing pavement is raveling. Authorities said the runway is closed indefinitely while the Navajo Division of Transportation determines improvement plans. However, the airport\u2019s tarmac will remain open for helicopter medical transport.\n\nArkansas\n\nHiwasse: The state has started working on multimillion-dollar construction projects to complete its section of Interstate 49. Highway Commissioner Phillip Taldo said when I-49 is finished, it will benefit the economy of northwest Arkansas. The highway will run from the Gulf Coast near New Orleans to Canada. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported that officials broke ground Tuesday on a project to complete the Bella Vista Bypass, known as the Arkansas/Missouri connector, 2.5 miles from the state line. The other project is to convert a roundabout to a single-point urban interchange in Bentonville. The director of the Arkansas Department of Transportation said the Bella Vista Bypass has been discussed for at least 25 years. Taldo said more funds are needed to complete the final section from Alma to Texarkana.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnza: Authorities said they seized illegal marijuana with a street value of $1 million after stopping a van on a Southern California street because a passenger wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. The California Highway Patrol said an officer smelled an odor of pot after stopping the van Monday in Anza, an unincorporated community in Riverside County. The Riverside Press-Enterprise said the van was full of trash bags and moving boxes that the driver acknowledged contained marijuana. The CHP said it found 335 pounds of pot. Marijuana use is legal in California but some cultivation and transportation of the plant remains illegal.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: A marijuana grower announced it lost millions of dollars during a wintry storm after half of the plants froze before harvest. The Marijuana Business Daily reported Wednesday that Pueblo-based Los Sue\u00f1os Farms lost about 20,000 plants in hours of subfreezing temperatures and several inches of snow during an October storm. Company employees said the damage is expected to affect the entire state\u2019s marijuana supply. Employees said retailers and processors could face higher wholesale cannabis prices, but extractors are expected to benefit by gaining access to additional plant material to manufacture goods such as infused products, edibles and concentrates. Employees said they tried salvaging the crops by covering them with blankets and using hot water to keep the roots warm. Los Sue\u00f1os owns dozens of acres for outdoor production.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: Five police officers are suing Stamford, alleging city officials ignored precise scores on the sergeants\u2019 exam and overlooked them for promotions. The Stamford Advocate reported that officers are promoted to sergeant if they obtain the top three scores or score within five points of the top score on the sergeants\u2019 exam. Court documents indicate that the officers who received the top three scores were selected for promotion. The plaintiffs said they were passed over for promotion in favor of colleagues who scored lower on the promotion exam. They allege the city violated civil-service rules and the city charter. Then suit is similar to a complaint filed last year by city firefighters. A city attorney said she could not comment on the suit.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Chipotle introduced a program Tuesday that allows employees to pursue a college degree debt-free at five institutions across the country, including Wilmington University. Through a partnership with Guild Education, a company that works as an intermediary between companies and employees to offer education benefits, Chipotle is covering all costs upfront for 75 business and technology degrees. The only immediate out-of-pocket expense is books. Wilmington University declined an interview request Wednesday. When asked via email how and why Wilmington University partnered with Guild and Chipotle, the university\u2019s president Dr. LaVerne Harmon said in a statement, \u201cWilmington University is delighted to be a part of Chipotle\u2019s vision to help employees reach their academic goals and improve their lives through education.\u201d At Wilmington University, Chipotle employees can pursue degrees related to marketing, computer science and organizational and business management. Chipotle has six locations in New Castle County and eight throughout Delaware. With about 25 employees per location, according to Chipotle\u2019s annual shareholder report, the company employees roughly 200 people in Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Yahoo recently announced that it plans to roll back the functionality of its Yahoo Groups website, which is a popular tool used for discussing neighborhood issues in the district, WUSA-TV reported. Dozens of neighborhoods from Tenleytown to Anacostia use the Yahoo Groups website to create online forums for locals to bring attention to policy issues, crime and even missing pets and packages. According to Yahoo, on Oct. 28, users will no longer be able to upload content onto the site. Then, on Dec. 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. In addition, all public groups on the website will be made private. However, users will still be able to communicate with other users within existing groups via email. Yahoo has suggested group users save any conversations, pictures or links that they need from their community forums before they delete them in December.\n\nFlorida\n\nA rare yellow northern cardinal was spotted in Port St. Lucie, Fla., on Saturday morning. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED BY TRACY WORKMAN)\n\nPort St. Lucie: A rare yellow northern cardinal with a genetic color mutation was spotted and photographed in Port St. Lucie on Saturday morning. Tracy Workman, who teaches photography at a homeschooling organization in Port St. Lucie, said she first spotted the bird in her backyard Oct. 3. Nine days later, Workman saw the rare bird again, following it for 5 minutes and using her Canon T5i camera to capture some photographs. Geoffrey Hill, a professor and curator of birds at Auburn University and an expert on bird coloration, said the bird in Workman\u2019s photographs is an adult male northern cardinal with a rare genetic mutation found in the species. Hill said the mutation found in the northern cardinal species acts as a \u201cknockout of the redness pathway\u201d in the bird\u2019s DNA, blocking the normal red pigment and replacing it with vibrant yellow color. Only three yellow cardinal sightings are reported a year, making the bird\u2019s appearance a rare \u201cone in a million\u201d finding, Hill said. The mutation is analogous to albinism found in humans, Hill said. Like humans, all birds have DNA that is subject to mutations. The bird was found in the area of Prima Vista Boulevard and Floresta Drive, but Workman did not want to disclose the exact location for fear of an increase in excited bird watchers coming to her house. Workman gave the yellow cardinal the nickname \u201cSunny,\u201d she said. Thomas Webber, a collection manager of the Division of Ornithology at the Florida Museum in Gainesville, said the yellow cardinal makes up \u201cwell below 1 percent\u201d of the entire cardinal population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCovington: The city has asked a company that sterilizes medical devices to temporarily stop work over air quality tests that show elevated levels of a carcinogen that leaked from the facility last month. News outlets reported Covington officials want Becton Dickinson to cease operations until more emissions controls are implemented and tests show they\u2019re effective. A city statement said preliminary air quality test results showed elevated levels of ethylene oxide. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sid exposure to the colorless gas can cause nausea, headaches, breathing difficulties, exhaustion and other negative effects. Cobb County recently paused the operations of another company, Sterigenics, because of concerns over the same chemical. Becton Dickinson released a statement that said the chemical can come from many sources.\n\nHawaii\n\nHIlo: The Hawaii County Council committee has approved a proposed ban on using herbicides on county property, news reports said. The Agriculture, Water, Energy and Environmental Management Committee voted Tuesday to forward the bill to the first of two required council hearings. The bill sponsored by Councilwoman Rebecca Villegas would ban herbicide use for four years in several categories of property owned by the county. The bill called for a transition period starting in January and a complete ban implemented by 2024. The ban would apply to county agencies that maintain public areas including parks, roadsides, sidewalks, trails, drainageways, and waterways. Private property owners would not be affected, officials said. The proposal includes a long list of specific chemicals to be banned, along with examples of products that contain the substances, such as weed killers with glyphosate. Glyphosate\u2019s connection to cancer in humans remains a subject of scientific and legal debate. The bill would require the public works department to hire a consultant to train work crews, said Director David Yamamoto.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d\u2019Alene: Staff at the Coeur d\u2019Alene Public Library have confirmed at least one person is intentionally hiding books dealing with issues traditionally assigned to more liberal political platforms. Books promoting LGBTQ rights, discussing gun control policies and criticizing President Donald Trump were found hidden in spaces throughout the library, the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press reported Wednesday. Library Director Bette Ammon is certain the activity is not an accident or miscommunication after receiving an anonymous comment card. Books on other topics were also moved, including readings on impeachment, white privilege and women voting rights, staff members said. For each book that is hidden, the library spends up to $20 for a replacement and hours of time to locate the original copies. Books are hidden about five times a week to 10 times a month, she said. They are usually recovered days later in spots the farthest from staff vantage points.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot is pushing two options for a Chicago casino. One calls for a casino owned by the city and the state, and the other calls for a privately-owned casino. Lightfoot pitched the proposal to Illinois lawmakers. She said either would require the Legislature to approve taxes lower than those written into expanded gambling legislation enacted earlier this year. A study by Las Vegas-based Union Gaming determined that with an effective tax rate of 72% \u2013 including a third of revenue earmarked for city police and firefighter pensions \u2013 on top of fees, no developer could secure financing for the construction of a casino. Democratic state Rep. Greg Harris of Chicago said Lightfoot will have a hard time getting a tax change. He said the tax structure for a Chicago casino is part of a package for existing casinos and six new ones.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The naming of a downtown Indianapolis post office in honor of former U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar has now been approved by both houses of Congress. The House endorsed the proposal in a unanimous voice vote on Wednesday after the Senate approved it in July. All nine of Indiana\u2019s House members and both senators joined together on legislation naming the postal branch a few blocks north of Monument Circle in the city where Lugar was mayor before his 36-year Senate tenure. The proposal follows Lugar\u2019s death in April at age 87. Democratic Rep. Andre Carson praised the Republican Lugar\u2019s bipartisan work, most prominently helping spur the post-Cold War dismantling of thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons.\n\nIowa\n\nU.S. Marines of the 28th Regiment, 5th Division, raise the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima, Japan. The Marine Corps corrected the identity of one of the men who were photographed raising the flag. Cpl. Harold P. Keller, who has relatives in Central Iowa, is mostly obscured behind the Marine second from right, the Marines now say. (Photo: Joe Rosenthal/AP)\n\nDes Moines: The Marine Corps has corrected the identity of another of the men who were photographed raising the American flag at Iwo Jima during World War II. The Marines said in a statement Thursday that after questions were raised by historians who studied photos and films, it determined that Cpl. Harold P. Keller \u2013 who has relatives living in Brooklyn in central Iowa \u2013 was among the six men who raised the flag. The Marines said Pfc. Rene Gagnon had helped in the effort but for decades was mistakenly identified by the Marines as one of the flag-raisers. Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal shot the iconic photograph atop Mount Suribachi during an intense battle between American and Japanese forces in 1945. In 2016, the Marines corrected the identity of another man in the photo after historians raised questions. NBC News, which first reported on the Marines\u2019 decision, said Keller died in 1979 in Grinnell. \u201cHe never spoke about any of this when we were growing up,\u201d Keller\u2019s daughter, Kay Maurer, 70, told NBC News. \u201cWe knew he fought in the war, we knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point. ... But he didn\u2019t tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.\u201d\n\nKansas\n\nEmporia: Two sisters found a partially fossilized bear skull while kayaking the Arkansas River in south-central Kansas. The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks said in a news release that sisters Ashley and Erin Watt made the discovery in August after flooding apparently dislodged the skull. They posted their find on Facebook, which caught the attention of a game warden. Two Sternberg Museum of Natural History paleontologists then took a look. One of the paleontologists, Mike Everhart, said the skull was washed out of the same river sediments where Ice Age-era bison remains were found. It\u2019s believed to be either a modern grizzly or an older species. There are several historical accounts of grizzlies in Kansas. But they are believed to have died out in the state by the mid-1800s.\n\nKentucky\n\nCarter Matthew Willett received a huge card for his 10th birthday, along with thousands of other cards. He's battling a rare form of cancer. (Photo: Provided)\n\nLouisville: A boy undergoing chemotherapy who asked for cards for his 10th birthday has received more than 2,000 so far. News outlets reported Carter Matthew Willett turned 10 on Thursday and has several weeks left of his current bout of chemotherapy. Willett was diagnosed last year with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, a rare form of cancer. A Facebook page following his story said Willett has had a bump on his head since he was 4 months old. It said the bump really started to bother him last year and it was removed around Thanksgiving. It said the family learned days later that the bump had been a cancerous tumor. Recent photos posted on the page showed the family receiving dozens of letters and packages, with Willett even posing with some mail carriers. If you still would like to send a card or gift, send it to 2825 Elam Drive, Louisville, Ky., 40213.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Tulane University has announced plans for a major book festival to be held annually between Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest. The first New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University will be March 19-21. A news release said more than 40 authors have signed on so far, including Fox News Channel commentator Donna Brazile, humorist Roy Blount, Jr., novelist John Grisham and New Yorker staff writer Malcolm Gladwell. University spokesman Roger Dunaway said most of the festival will be free, with a limited number of ticketed events. The original New Orleans Book Festival was created in 2010 as a one-day children\u2019s festival, expanding from 2015 through 2017 into an all-around book festival. It was founded by Cheryl Landrieu when her husband was New Orleans\u2019 mayor. She\u2019s co-chair of the new festival.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State officials said they won\u2019t give driver\u2019s license and state identification card information, including citizenship status, to federal officials seeking to include it in the 2020 Census. The Portland Press Herald reported state officials denied the Census Bureau\u2019s request in late September. The bureau said it was seeking the information to increase census accuracy. All 50 states received the request. Patty Morneault, the deputy secretary of state for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, told census officials Maine doesn\u2019t provide bulk data that includes personal information and lacks the capacity for the monthly reports requested. Morneault said the decision adhered to Maine law \u201cand the sacred trust of the citizens of Maine.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court ruled a specific question regarding citizenship can\u2019t be included in the 2020 Census questionnaire.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Board of Public Works has approved the Maryland Stadium Authority\u2019s authorization to issue new bonds for an expansion of the Ocean City Convention Center. The board on Wednesday also approved MSA\u2019s authorization to structure financing terms for the project. State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, who represents Ocean City, said the facility has long been an important economic driver for the city and the state. The expansion is set to create more than 600 jobs and bring in more than $60 million to the state. Carozza sponsored a bill to authorize the MSA to issue $24.5 million in bonds for the expansion. Groundbreaking is set for April, with a completion date of December 2021.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The second-largest city in Massachusetts is sticking with the Oct. 31 date for Halloween celebrations this year. The Worcester City Council made the decision on Tuesday. Councilor Matthew Walley was pushing to permanently change the holiday\u2019s date to the last Saturday of October to avoid problems with midweek trick-or-treating. On Tuesday, Walley acknowledged it is too late to make the change for this year because many Halloween events in the city have been planned, but he would like to consider it for the future. The Telegram & Gazette reported many city councilors appear to have no interest in changing Halloween\u2019s date, including longtime Councilor-at-Large Konstantina Lukes, who said, \u201clet\u2019s not rewrite history now.\u201d\n\nMichigan\n\nWayland: A Native American tribe is planning a $100 million expansion of its western Michigan casino that will include adding new dining, entertainment and gaming space. MLive.com reported Thursday that the Gun Lake Tribe said preliminary site work has started at the casino in Wayland. About 76,000 square feet of space will be added to the casino, which has been open since 2011. The expansion will accommodate more than 2,000 slot machines and 47 table games and is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The casino employs 1,100 people and officials said the expansion will lead to an additional 125 hires. The announcement comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year it properly ended a lawsuit over the tribe\u2019s Michigan casino.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The federal courthouse in Minneapolis is being named after a judge who is seen as a trailblazer in the Twin Cities legal community. Judge Diana Murphy was the first woman appointed to the federal bench in Minnesota in 1980, and later became the first woman to sit on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. She died last year at the age of 84. In a landmark case, Murphy ruled in 1994 that the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe retained hunting and fishing rights outlined in an 1837 treaty. The state of Minnesota appealed, but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Murphy\u2019s decision. Margaret Chutich, a Minnesota Supreme Court justice who worked as a law clerk for Murphy in the mid-1980s, told Minnesota Public Radio News that Murphy always did the best she could with the facts and law she had.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Nearly $12 million from a state public trust fund will go toward waterfront projects and park improvements along the state\u2019s Gulf Coast. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann presented the $11.74 million from the Public Trust Tidelands fund on Wednesday. The Biloxi Sun-Herald reported the money will finance new boardwalks, boat ramps, park features, restoration initiatives, educational facilities and other projects along the shore. The trust is primarily funded through leases and in lieu of payments for on-shore casinos and other businesses that sit on state-owned land. Some shipping companies and utility companies also pay into the trust. Hosemann said about $6 million is set aside for public access projects. Another $3.5 million will support the Department of Marine Resources operations and an additional $1 million is allotted for bond repayment.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Less than half of Missouri schoolchildren are performing at grade level in English and math for the second straight year, according to newly released state data that critics complain makes it difficult to tell how individual school districts are faring overall. At issue is that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education didn\u2019t provide district-level annual performance report scores when it released the data Thursday. Those scores, which were a combination of measures that included test scores, attendance and graduation rates, have been used to make accreditation decisions. In their place, the state released statewide and district level test averages, along with a spreadsheet of color charts and scales that comes with a 77-page guide. Cici Tompkins, of the nonprofit Children\u2019s Education Alliance of Missouri, said that without the single composite score, it\u2019s more difficult to hold districts accountable, particularly for families who are eligible to transfer from unaccredited to accredited districts under state law. Overall statewide test scores show that 49% of students in the public and charter schools are proficient or advanced in English and 42% in math, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The worst-performing district was the provisionally accredited Normandy school system in the St. Louis area. Normandy Superintendent Charles Pearson said the district has \u201cput things in place to move it forward,\u201d including a new early childhood center.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Two grizzly bear cubs have been killed by a train in northwestern Montana, driving the number of bear deaths toward last year\u2019s record level for the region, state officials said. The two cubs, one female and the other of unknown sex, were found Tuesday night along railroad tracks near the small town of Trego, about 30 miles south of the Canadian border, said Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks spokesman Dillon Tabish. A record 46 grizzly bears died in 2018 in a region that includes Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and surrounding areas. The region is home to more than 1,000 bears. The 44 grizzlies killed or removed to date in 2019 include eight hit by trains, the most recorded in a year. About half of the bears have been killed by wildlife managers in response to run-ins with people or livestock. Two bears listed on the mortality list were kept alive but moved, to augment a different population of the animals along the Montana-Idaho border. Grizzlies are protected as a threatened species across the Lower 48 states. They are hunted in Alaska and portions of Canada.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Authorities said a man was rescued after being trapped in a storm drain for at least 24 hours. Lincoln Fire & Rescue Chief Michael Despain said Wednesday that someone heard the man\u2019s cries for help shortly before 6 p.m. Tuesday. First responders couldn\u2019t immediately find the man, so they spread out. He was discovered about three blocks northeast of the Capitol, inside a 4-foot-wide pipe, with a bicycle. Despain said it took less than 30 minutes to get him out, and he was treated at the scene. It\u2019s unclear how the man got into the drain. Despain said the man appeared to have mental health problems. His name hasn\u2019t been released.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pilot apparently escaped any serious injury in a small plane crash north of Reno between Pyramid Lake and the California line. Washoe County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Bob Harmon said hunters discovered the aircraft wreckage Thursday morning. He told the Reno Gazette Journal the pilot subsequently was accounted for and is OK. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said a preliminary investigation indicated a small, single-engine Piper PA18 suffered substantial damage when it crashed while landing in an open field near Gerlach at about 4 p.m. Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear where the aircraft took off from or where it was heading.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Health and Human Services said an adult from Laconia has tested positive for a mosquito-borne virus. The department said Wednesday the adult tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus, transmitted by infected mosquitoes. It\u2019s the second time a case has been identified in the state this year; it was identified in a Kingston resident in August. Reports of Jamestown Canyon virus in humans are rare but have increased over the last several years. This is New Hampshire\u2019s eighth case since the state\u2019s first report of the disease in 2013. The department said most illnesses caused by the virus have been mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement has been reported, including fatal infections.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLittle Egg Harbor: A state appellate court has upheld a man\u2019s conviction on an obscenity charge for watching porn videos on his iPad while sitting in his car outside a fast-food restaurant. Little Egg Harbor police responded to the restaurant in April 2014 after getting a complaint about 53-year-old David Lomanto\u2019s activities. Authorities said he initially refused to leave his car, then repeatedly refused to show the officer his license or other identification. Lomanto was charged with obstruction, and a count of public communication of obscenity was later filed. He was convicted in May 2017 and sentenced to two concurrent one-year terms of probation and five days in jail, which he has served. Lomanto claimed the definition of \u201cpublicly communicates\u201d in the obscenity law is overly broad and that watching porn in the privacy of his car is protected under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDozens of environmental groups and scientists are asking U.S. wildlife managers to rethink how they plan to ensure the survival of Mexican gray wolves in the Southwest. Following a loss in federal court, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working on crafting a new rule to guide the management of the endangered predators in New Mexico and Arizona. (Photo: Jeff Roberson/AP)\n\nAlbuquerque: Dozens of environmental groups and scientists are asking U.S. wildlife managers to rethink how they plan to ensure the survival of Mexican gray wolves in the Southwest. Following a loss in federal court, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working on crafting a new rule to guide the management of the endangered predators in New Mexico and Arizona. The coalition said that rule should be based on \u201can entirely new approach\u201d that incorporates the best science while acknowledging the recovery effort\u2019s past shortcomings. The groups on Wednesday sent a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and federal wildlife managers. They\u2019re asking that the process to revise the management rule be public and that a wide range of alternatives be considered since the program has faltered over the years.\n\nNew York\n\nA security fence surrounds inmate housing at the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York City. Lawmakers voted Thursday to close the complex, which has become synonymous with violence and neglect and replace it with four smaller jails intended to be more modern and humane. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews/AP)\n\nNew York City: Lawmakers voted Thursday to close the notorious Rikers Island jail complex, which has become synonymous with violence and neglect, and replace it with four smaller jails intended to be more modern and humane. The City Council voted 36-13 to replace the complex with four smaller jails located closer to the city\u2019s main courthouses in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens. Rikers is scheduled to shutter by 2026, ending a decades-long run as one of the world\u2019s largest jails. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other Democrats support the plan, which has a price tag of more than $8 billion, in part because of a belief that in an age of falling crime rates, huge jails are part of the public safety problem rather than part of the solution. The vote on the plan was disrupted by anti-jail activists who chanted \u201cIf you build it they will fill it\u201d and threw flyers from the balcony. City officials said a steep drop in the jail population has made it feasible to close Rikers, a complex of 10 jails on an island between Queens and the Bronx that mainly houses inmates awaiting trial. Backers of the jail overhaul said they expect the city\u2019s jail population will keep dropping because of criminal justice reforms. Critics of the plan said fewer cells may mean more violent criminals on city streets.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: The state Department of Labor has issued more than $21,000 in fines to three companies involved in a deadly natural gas explosion. News outlets reported PSNC Energy and two subcontractors were cited for the April 10 explosion in Durham that killed two people, injured 25 and destroyed buildings. Optic Cable Technology was fined $14,000 for two safety violations. The department said Optic didn\u2019t locate underground pipes before drilling and didn\u2019t immediately call authorities after the gas line ruptured. PS Splicing LLC was fined $2,100 for not performing regular inspections of the site. PSNC, part of Dominion Energy, was fined $5,000 for \u201cineffective response procedures.\u201d The department said the responding employee wasn\u2019t wearing protective gear and parked his vehicle near the leak. The utility said it disagrees with the findings.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators said drillers set a record for oil production in August. The Department of Mineral Resources said the state produced an average of 1.47 million barrels of oil daily in August. That\u2019s up from the previous record of 1.44 million barrels a day in set in July. North Dakota also produced a record 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in August, up from 2.9 billion cubic feet in July. Statewide, companies flared 19% of all gas produced in August, which is well above the 12% target. There were 15,942 wells producing in August, down a dozen from the record set in July. The August totals are the latest figures available. There were 60 drill rigs operating Thursday, down two from the August average.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Mayor Frank Jackson announced a commitment of up to $1 million every year for the next 10 years to replenish the city\u2019s tree canopy. Jackson made his announcement during the opening of the Sustainable Cleveland 2019 Summit on Wednesday. The mayor said the efforts came from a conference he had attended a decade ago that analyzed what might be done to respond to the impact of the recession. The mayor realized any solution would have to include sustainability and replenishing the tree canopy falls within that. The plan would commit the city to plant new trees as well as remove dead or diseased ones for several benefits, including absorbing air pollution and increasing property values in the area.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Visitation is being reinstated at two more Oklahoma prisons locked down after one inmate was killed and three dozen were injured during coordinated violence that officials said resulted from race-based gang tension.

The Capital Press reported Wednesday that the state Department of Environmental Quality found that growers who altered spray regimens helped achieve the water quality improvements. Officials said about 50% of waterway sites tested under an interagency \u201cpesticide stewardship partnership\u201d program showed progress in pesticide detections and concentrations. Areas with reductions included the Walla Walla watershed and Waco basin. The tests compared results between 2015 and 2017 to the previous two years.

(Photo: Furman University)\n\nGreenville:Furman University students returned from fall break to discover swastikas and \u201csexually explicit\u201d comments and drawings in one dormitory.

Menzer, a member of Temple of Israel in Greenville, said for her and others on campus, the graffiti is not something that can\u2019t be brushed off as a joke. She said she does not feel that Furman is unique or more dangerous than other campuses because of the incident, but that the graffiti is a reflection of the rise in white supremacy worldwide.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nChristopher Bruce, 58, arrives for his trial at Minnehaha County Courthouse in Sioux Falls, S.D.
