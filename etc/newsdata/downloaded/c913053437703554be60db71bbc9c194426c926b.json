Terrific team at Bart\u2019s Hospital opened me up, had a look around, found a second valve that needed attention, and now instead of feeling like an old Ford Anglia I\u2019m well on my way to feeling like a one previous owner Golf GTI.\n\nSir Michael Palin (pictured on ITV's This Morning in May) underwent a four-hour heart operation to fix a leaky valve\n\n'The operation took over four hours but I felt very little pain afterwards. Main problem now is trying hard not to do too much.\n\n'My chest won\u2019t really be ready for any gold medallions for at least six weeks, and I\u2019m told the ticker, which enlarges to deal with the extra work-load from dysfunctional valves, may take a year to return to normal size.\n\n'The upside is I have to take three months off work \u2013 doctor\u2019s orders. Longest period without major work since I started in the biz in 1965.\n\n'A chance to look around and see what others are doing. Which at the moment seems largely shouting at each other.'\n\nHe thanked everyone who had sent him cards, emails and messages and said he plans to 'go back to doing nothing'.", "description": "Monty Python star Sir Michael Palin, 76, wrote on his website that the four-hour operation at an NHS hospital in London had gone well.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/01/19278308-0-image-a-126_1570148963427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
