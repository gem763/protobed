He was the unusual husband who was happy to take his wife\u2019s shopping list and then head out to pick up the day\u2019s groceries: glossy baladi eggplant, fragrant bunches of cilantro and parsley, dates, creamy gvina levana, and perhaps more freshly toasted and ground baharat spice mix, which seemed to make its way into so many of my mom\u2019s recipes.\n\nI would often go with my father when he shopped. Shuk HaCarmel in Tel Aviv was not far from our home in the suburbs and was also right near the Yemenite quarter in which my dad spent his childhood. We would do the shopping and then wander into the shuk\u2019s Yemenite quarter, which housed a handful of simple restaurants serving Yemenite classics, the kind of food you\u2019d otherwise find only in a family\u2019s home.\n\nMy dad was happy to take on the shopping because he knew he\u2019d be rewarded by my mother\u2019s fantastic cooking (plus he was a nice guy). But he also might have volunteered for the shuk because he could indulge in some of the food he loved best\u2014especially lachuch, a springy, moist Yemenite flatbread that was the one dish from his culture that my mom never mastered.\n\nMy Persian mom was born in Iran, and was eventually raised in an Iraqi household. In Israel, our family would be called \u201cMizrahi,\u201d meaning Jews who came from the Middle East rather than those with roots in Spain (Sephardic) or elsewhere in Europe (Ashkenazi).\n\nMizrahi dishes are the foods of my childhood, and I learned to make them starting at about age eleven, when I became my mom\u2019s assistant. She was always cooking something intriguing and delicious\u2014Persian rice dishes fragrant with handfuls of herbs; kubbaneh, a delicious Yemenite bread she\u2019d bake overnight for Shabbat lunch; chicken in fassenjan, a sauce made from ground walnuts and pomegranate juice and flavored with crazy-looking dried Persian limes. Our next-door neighbor was Moroccan, and she would let me help her with the hand-rolled couscous and all the spicy, tangy accompaniments for it\u2014pumpkin chirshi, pepper and tomato matboucha, sweet and savory lamb tagine.\n\nWhile my mom and neighbor were getting free labor, I was getting an education, and I ended up as a professional chef (with a stop at cooking school along the way). It\u2019s those foods of my multicultural childhood that I crave the most and that I now cook most often here in New York City. I\u2019ve even built restaurants around my favorite Mizrahi dishes: My fast-casual Israeli chain, Ta\u00efm, was one of the first in the United States to serve sabich, an Iraqi Jewish, deliciously sloppy fried eggplant sandwich \u2026 something that just a few years ago you\u2019d never have seen outside the neighborhood. And my couscous restaurant, Kish-Kash, celebrates all the influences of North African cuisine that surrounded me throughout my childhood.\n\nI\u2019m gratified to see that the rest of the world is catching on. So many of the wonderful dishes I grew up cooking and eating are no longer considered ochel shel bayit\u2014food you would only eat at home\u2014but are being featured on restaurant menus all over Israel and in the United States.\n\nFood like this, whether Persian, Moroccan, Ethiopian, or Yemenite, represents not only my childhood and my heart but also Israeli cuisine as a whole\u2014a multicultural mosaic of traditions from literally all over the globe, served in the spirit of generosity, hospitality, and joy, evolving as Israel grows as a nation. Israeli cuisine is young but with ancient roots, and I\u2019m happy to be a part of its evolution. Now you can cook these dishes, too, and join me as we continue to create new traditions.\n\nFassenjan Meatballs: Persian Beef and Duck Meatballs in Walnut-Pomegranate Sauce\n\nWhat this brownish and somewhat grainy sauce\u2014called fassenjan\u2014lacks in looks, it more than makes up for in rich, intense flavor, thanks to a powerful combo of walnuts, pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, and dried limes. The brown, rock-hard Persian limes won\u2019t win a beauty pageant either, but crack them in your hands and inhale the complex citrusy aroma with hints of smokiness, and you\u2019ll understand why cooks in Iran treasure them. You can find dried limes (or dried lemons) in Middle Eastern groceries or order them online. They\u2019re worth seeking out, and they keep indefinitely.\n\nNote: You can use all ground beef (2 pounds) instead of the duck. Serves 6 to 8\n\nFassenjan Meatballs\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nMeatballs\n\n1 pound Ground beef\n\n1 pound Ground duck breast\n\n1 yellow Onion, coarsely grated\n\n\u00bd cup Finely chopped fresh parsley\n\n1 tsp ground Coriander\n\n2 tsp Kosher salt\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nVegetable oil, for frying\n\nSauce\n\n1 Tbsp Extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1 Onion, coarsely grated\n\n2 medium Garlic cloves, grated or minced\n\n1 tsp Grated fresh ginger\n\n1\u00bd cups Very finely chopped walnuts\n\n\u00bd tsp Ground cumin\n\n\u00bd tsp Kosher salt, plus more if needed\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n2 cups Pure unsweetened pomegranate juice (we like POM Wonderful)\n\n\u00bd cup Pomegranate molasses\n\n2 dried Persian limes, cracked\n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nTo Serve\n\nCooked white rice\n\nFresh pomegranate seeds, for garnish (optional)\n\nFresh cilantro leaves, for garnish\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nPrepare the Patties: Put the beef and duck in a large bowl, add the onion and parsley, and season with the coriander, salt, and several twists of pepper. Knead thoroughly to blend the ingredients. If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.\n\nRub your hands with a bit of vegetable oil and shape the meat mixture into golf ball\u2013sized meatballs; set them on a tray.\n\nLine a plate or separate tray with paper towels. Coat the bottom of a large skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and fry quickly until they are just golden brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes total; shake the pan a few times to roll the meatballs in the oil and make sure they are browned evenly. For the best browning, don\u2019t crowd the pan; work in batches if you need to. Transfer the meatballs to the paper towels. Repeat to cook the remaining meatballs; set aside.\n\nPrepare the Sauce: Heat the oil in a wide saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the walnuts and saut\u00e9 for another 3 minutes. Season with the cumin, \u00bd teaspoon salt, and several twists of black pepper. Pour in the pomegranate juice and molasses and add the dried limes. Bring to a simmer, stirring often. Taste and adjust the seasoning\u2014once you add the meatballs, you won\u2019t be able to stir, so make sure the sauce is seasoned to your liking.\n\nGently slide the meatballs into the sauce in a single layer, making sure they are fully submerged in the sauce (shake the pan slightly to settle them).\n\nCover the pan and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the sauce is thick and shiny, another 10 minutes or so. Serve hot over white rice, garnished with pomegranate seeds (if they are in season) and cilantro leaves. If not serving immediately, let cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days; reheat gently.\n\nExcerpted from Shuk by Einat Admont and Janna Gur (Artisan Books).
