(AP) - The Trail Blazers have a number of new players for Portland\u2019s 50th anniversary season- and a new resolve after their playoff run last spring.\n\nJoining the well-established backcourt of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum on Portland\u2019s roster are such offseason acquisitions as Hassan Whiteside, Pau Gasol and Kent Bazemore. The Blazers open preseason camp on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s coming together, naturally,\u201d Lillard said Monday at the team\u2019s media day. \u201cBeing together for some weeks now and playing pickup has just been cool. I think the environment that we\u2019ve created over the years, guys come in and it\u2019s easy to get comfortable with it. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nLast season the Blazers finished 53-29 and clinched the third seed in the Western Conference, earning home court for the first round - and a series with the Thunder. Portland wrapped that series up in five games, capped by Lillard\u2019s memorable walk-off 3-pointer, and advanced to the conference finals for the first time in 19 years.\n\nPortland was coming off two seasons that ended with first-round playoff sweeps. The team, which had surprisingly little turnover over those years, started last season determined to take the next step. Now they\u2019re aiming for more.\n\n\u201cOn one side we\u2019re not coming into this season saying, \u2018Oh we made it to the Western Conference finals last year so that\u2019s automatically going to happen.\u2019 We\u2019ve got a completely different team, a lot of building to be done,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cBut this year we\u2019re coming in and our focus is to win a championship. I think our mentality has to shift to that.\u201d\n\nThe Blazers have shored up their options at center while Jusuf Nurkic continues to rehab from a broken left leg that kept him out of the playoffs. Nurkic was averaging 15.6 points and 10.4 rebounds a game before he was hurt in March.\n\nThe Blazers were able to turn to Enes Kanter, who was waived by the New York Knicks following the trade deadline and signed by Portland for the rest of the season. Kanter moved on in the offseason to the Celtics.\n\nIn the offseason, the Blazers acquired Hassan Whiteside from the Heat in a four-team deal that sent Meyers Leonard to Miami and Moe Harkless to the L.A. Clippers, while also picking up veteran big Gasol and forward Anthony Tolliver.\n\nWhiteside averaged 12.3 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.89 blocks per game last season in Miami.\n\nGasol said he is limited at the moment because of a surgery he had in February, part of a frustrating season that started with the Spurs and ended with the Milwaukee Bucks. A 19-year NBA veteran, Gasol said he\u2019ll be limited in workouts during camp and he wouldn\u2019t commit to being available on opening day.\n\nLillard is excited about the depth the Blazers acquired. Among the others is Bazemore, whom the Blazers got from Atlanta in a trade for Evan Turner.\n\nThe team\u2019s on-court leader, Lillard averaged 25.8 points and 6.9 assists and earned his fourth All-Star nod during the regular season. He signed a super-max contract extension worth $196 million in the offseason.\n\nThe Blazers also look forward this season to celebrating the 50th anniversary of the franchise. The team will play a preseason game at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, where the team won its 1977 NBA championship. The Blazers held their media day at the arena Monday.\n\nLast season the Blazers opened the preseason on a somber note. Owner Paul Allen passed away after a battle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Portland dedicated its season to him.\n\nBlazers President of Basketball Operations Neil Olshey said Allen\u2019s sister, Jody Allen, wants to win a \u201ccouple of championships,\u201d with the Blazers, reiterating her commitment to the team. Olshey said she was just unanimously approved by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors.\n\nOlshey pointed to the team\u2019s newly acquired depth and recent playoff experience for his optimism.\n\n\u201cThis is the deepest, most talented, most experienced team we\u2019ve had since we\u2019ve been here. \u2026 Clearly when Nurk gets back, it\u2019s the biggest team we\u2019ve had. I like the fact we brought in guys like Pau with a championship pedigree, who have been to where we\u2019re trying to get to,\u201d Olshey said. \u201cAnd I think coming off the heels of last year\u2019s run, it\u2019s given these guys a springboard. Instead of finishing on a negative, we finished really strong and it has really inspired the guys.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trail Blazers have a number of new players for Portland's 50th anniversary season- and a new resolve after their playoff run last spring.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
