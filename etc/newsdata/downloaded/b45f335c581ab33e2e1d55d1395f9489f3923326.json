Numerous financial systems have undertaken blockchain-based systems meant to move settlement of securities onto the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the digital currency bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers.\n\nCredit Suisse and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale will be the first to use Paxos Settlement Service, Paxos said.\n\nPaxos said it will begin settlement of U.S. equity transactions once two of its early adopters file for approval with the SEC to allow them to settle on Paxos. That approval should not take more than 30 days, said Charles Cascarilla, chief executive officer and co-founder of Paxos.\n\n\u201cIf you think about what we have been trying to accomplish here at Paxos: it\u2019s creating modern financial infrastructure in more open financial systems,\u201d Cascarilla told Reuters in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cBeing able to settle U.S. equities on the blockchain is an important first step. But it\u2019s just the first step. And we\u2019re going to continue what we have done here to be able to do more and more types of securities,\u201d he added.\n\nThe platform will help clients reduce fees and gain access to capital otherwise trapped in the legacy settlement system, Paxos said. It will also allow the simultaneous exchange of cash and securities to settle trades and is compatible with current systems, simplifying integration.\n\nPaxos will be able to settle a limited number of equity stocks: generally liquid, large-cap stocks that have low volatility, Cascarilla said.\n\nVolume to be settled will be under 1% of a stock\u2019s total volume, the Paxos chief added.\n\n\u201cWe will figure out a way to scale this,\u201d Cascarilla said.\n\nPaxos launched a stablecoin last year and in September got approval from New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services to launch a gold-backed digital token.", "description": "Paxos Trust Co, a New York-based regulated financial institution, said on Monday it will launch a blockchain-based settlement platform for a limited number of U.S.-listed equities after the company received a \"no-action\" letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "authors": ["Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
