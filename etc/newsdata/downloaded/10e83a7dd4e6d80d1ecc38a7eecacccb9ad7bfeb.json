Waybourn, while pushing back against a ruling that blocked a Trump administration immigration policy, said that if some of the 4,200 inmates in his custody are repeat offenders who, if they are released, will come back to \"run over your children.\".\n\n\u201cOf those people that we have in custody, we know for a fact that 72 percent of them are repeat offenders, so if we have to turn them loose, or they get released, they\u2019re coming back to your neighborhood and my neighborhood. These drunks will run over your children, and they will run over my children,\u201d Waybourn said.\n\n\u201cAnd if that happens, I know that you would want, and certainly I would want for you, the full force of the law. And immigration is part of that full force,\u201d he added.\n\nThe remarks prompted backlash some local Democrats in Tarrant County shortly after.\n\nState Rep. Chris Turner (D) on Twitter called the sheriff\u2019s comments \u201cthe kind of ignorant, irresponsible fear-mongering rhetoric that creates hate & division.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas Sheriff Waybourn learned nothing in the aftermath of El Paso tragedy? No elected official should say things like this, especially in a county as diverse as Tarrant,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThis is coming from one of the top law enforcement officials in Tarrant County; someone who is supposed to be impartial while carrying out their elected duties,\u201d tweeted State Rep. Nicole Collier (D).\n\nWaybourn said that about 7 percent of those people in his custody are in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cAnd they were being held for such offenses as murder, sexual assault of children \u2014 there was about 70 of them. And there were robbers in there and kidnappers and people who committed arson and people who were DWI,\u201d Waybourn said.\n\n\u201cAnd out of that, you know, you think about that, if we return them with this radical ruling out of California where you have a federal judge making law for the nation, or attempting to, it will put our communities in jeopardy,\u201d he said.\n\nDomingo Garcia, the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, told the Fort Worth-Star Telegram that he found it \u201cappalling that a man with a badge and gun like Sheriff Waybourn would make such ignorant and twisted racist statements influenced by his far right-wing ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that in Texas, the data shows that native-born residents are much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis sheriff needs to resign and apologize for his bigoted comments immediately. The domestic terrorist attacks in El Paso and Gilroy have shown that this rhetoric can have deadly consequences.\u201d", "description": "A Texas sheriff is gaining attention online for remarks he made about undocumented immigrants in his county\u2019s local prison population during a press briefing at the White House on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tarrant_sheriff_youtube_bill_waybourn.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
