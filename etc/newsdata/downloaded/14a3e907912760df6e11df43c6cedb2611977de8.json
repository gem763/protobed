Hurricane Dorian is just off the coast of South Carolina. (Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Hunt, a freelance writer and editor-at-large for Charleston magazine, writes features, profiles and essays for various publications.\n\nCHARLESTON \u2014 Here, September is the month that comes in like a lion: The tropics roil, and the storms spinning off Cape Verde tend to come our way. New backpacks were barely broken in, and textbooks still lay unopened when the district canceled school this week because of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s impending threat. Neighborhood kids have been fishing off docks and riding bikes to the Pitt Street Pharmacy for an old-fashioned milkshake, savoring their unexpected endless summer.\n\nFor the past several years, Charleston-area teachers have barely had a chance to memorize students\u2019 names before their lesson plans have been derailed by a hurricane: Matthew in 2016, Irma in 2017 and Florence in 2018. So far, as of this writing, we\u2019ve been spared a direct hit. But there\u2019s something else our community has failed to learn and that Dorian\u2019s gusty 100-plus mph lecture is trying to teach us. Lessons about respecting nature\u2019s feisty power, about understanding our effects on the landscape, about balancing growth and development with environmental sensitivity. In short, lessons about humility.\n\nHumility, though, has never been Charleston\u2019s strong suit. She\u2019s a proud old gal, celebrating her 350th birthday next year. Her forefathers were Revolutionary patriots and signers of the Declaration of Independence; their progeny were signers of the Order of Secession. Sure she\u2019s got some wrinkles, some old-age aches and pains: Take, for example, the system of outdated brick drainage tunnels, built before the Civil War and now undergoing a $235 million overhaul. In many respects, she\u2019s never been prouder, lovelier or more popular.\n\nCharleston wears her architectural finery with grace and elegance, and the city isn\u2019t shy about being the grand dame of Southern hospitality, with award-winning restaurants and five-star hotels. Hurricanes are not our only frequent guests: Tourism is a booming $22.6 billion annual industry in South Carolina, which launched its first nonstop transatlantic flight, to London, in April. A record 7.3 million visitors flocked to the greater Charleston region last year. By some estimates, almost 30 people move to the area each day.\n\n[Devastating hurricanes are the new normal. It's time to move away from the coasts.]\n\nAs Dorian demonstrates, weather happens where fronts collide. When you combine development pressures from tourism and population growth with increased threats related to climate change \u2014 from regular sunny-day flooding caused by King Tides, to more intense, more frequent tropical events \u2014 conditions get messy. Hotel construction is outpacing affordable housing developments by a long shot: An estimated 4,000 hotel rooms are in the works, compared with 944 homes and 800 rental units. Meanwhile, the congested Charleston area traffic moves as slowly as viscous Dorian did in its attack on the Bahamas. And elected officials seem to be moving equally slowly in their efforts to do anything about it: A bus rapid transit system is finally in the works but won\u2019t be operable until 2025.\n\nAs I write, Charleston is getting drenched and awaits a potential storm surge. Meanwhile, Gadsden Creek, the last remaining tidal creek on the historic peninsula, is barely holding on for life. WestEdge, a massive mixed-use development adjacent to the growing Medical University of South Carolina campus, has petitioned the state\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control for permission to fill the creek and make way for the project\u2019s second phase. This is not a cut-and-dried case of environmental idealists against the greedy developers: The polluted creek meanders over toxic landfill, frequently floods and needs restoration. Nonetheless, Gadsden Creek\u2019s four remaining acres of wetlands \u2014 and the herons that fish there, the crabs that scamper at low tide, the oysters and mussels that clack in the mud \u2014 symbolize what\u2019s at issue in Charleston. We are a city at sea level, under siege by climate change and development, and yet the very natural systems that help mitigate flooding are at risk.\n\nA similar conflict is playing out on nearby Kiawah Island, where developers seeking to build 50 luxury homes on a minuscule spit of sand are waiting for the state Supreme Court to hear their case, now on appeal for the fifth time. Captain Sam\u2019s Spit, as the whisper of sand is called, may well get washed away by Dorian or the next storm, but that doesn\u2019t erase the insanity of those trying to outwit nature for profit.\n\nCharleston has survived centuries of hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and war. She\u2019s given us shrimp and grits, \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d sweetgrass baskets, Ranky Tanky\u2019s Gullah-inspired jazz, Stephen Colbert, pelicans soaring over a storied harbor and more natural beauty than any of us deserve. She\u2019s earned her stripes as one of America\u2019s most charming cities \u2014 but we\u2019ve got to step up our game if she\u2019s to survive climate change and the pitfalls of fame.\n\nThat means balancing development with deference to marshes, dunes and barrier islands and protected upland forests \u2014 the natural ecosystems that buffer flooding and sea level rise. It means making the city safe for bicycles and pedestrians and investing in transit so we aren\u2019t solely dependent on fossil fuel-guzzling cars. And it means ensuring that long term residents in gentrifying areas, many of them African Americans, don\u2019t get pushed aside for glitzy hotels.\n\nIt means listening to the teacher howling outside my window as I type, his fierce gusts pummeling our palm trees. We are at nature\u2019s mercy. On this we\u2019ve been schooled one too many times.\n\nRead more:\n\nA hurricane is coming. Now we wait.\n\nI saw Florence sending millions of gallons of animal poop flooding across North Carolina\n\nHurricanes are deadly far from the sea.
