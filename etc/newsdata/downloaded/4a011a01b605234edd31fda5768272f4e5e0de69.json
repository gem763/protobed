(Johnny Parra/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Thinking up ways our all-encompassing crisis could get even worse has become a grimly popular parlor game for Venezuelans. For years, the go-to worst-case scenario was civil war between the political factions in our country. These days, an even scarier prospect has begun to displace that in the pantheon of Venezuelan nightmares: armed conflict with Colombia.\n\nThe reason? Venezuela\u2019s increasingly tight alliance with the drug-running guerrilla armies waging war on the Colombian state, which has rattled Bogota so hard it\u2019s now seeking a hemispheric response.\n\nOn Wednesday, Colombia, the United States and nine other countries invoked the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR), signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, which commits the countries of the Western Hemisphere to respond to military aggression against any one of them. The move came after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said he would deploy 150,000 troops to the border with Colombia. Invoking TIAR is an extreme measure in the region and an unmistakable sign that armed conflict is now a real possibility.\n\nFor some time, security analysts in Bogota have been alarmed by Caracas\u2019s embrace of ELN \u2014 the Cuban-backed National Liberation Army that for decades played second fiddle to the Soviet-inspired Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. But the recent announcement by top FARC leaders that they are returning to war made a tense situation much worse, creating the prospect of multiple forces within Colombia acting as Venezuelan proxies.\n\nFor more than a decade, Venezuela has served as a friendly safe space for Colombia\u2019s various leftist rebel guerrillas. Colombian rebels used Venezuela as a rear-guard, a place where their soldiers could go for R & R, for medical treatment or for training. Gradually, they expanded their operations in the country, using it as a conduit for drugs for export and running extortion rackets in Venezuelan territory.\n\nBut the depth of cooperation between Venezuela and Colombian rebels seems to have ballooned this year, as the Venezuelan state shifts from tolerating them to treating them as allies in a common fight.\n\nVenezuelan intelligence documents leaked to Colombian newsweekly Semana recently paint the most troubling picture yet, portraying Venezuela\u2019s relationship to Colombian \u201cred groups\u201d as something close to Iran\u2019s relationship with Hezbollah. Colombia\u2019s rebels aren\u2019t just tolerated in Venezuela; they\u2019re actively trained and armed there, including in the use of enormously dangerous weapons such as high-tech Russian shoulder-mounted antiaircraft missiles.\n\nThe documents leaked to Semana imply Venezuela is mainstreaming ELN and the resurgent FARC into its intelligence systems, relying on the groups to help identify high-value military targets inside Colombia. Pointedly, Colombia said FARC\u2019s video announcing a return to violence was shot inside Venezuela.\n\nFor a Venezuelan leadership that\u2019s increasingly paranoid about outside threats, this alliance with Colombia\u2019s rebels offers obvious benefits, strengthening its negotiating hand by enabling it to make credible threats to destabilize Colombia. For the rebel groups themselves, the benefits are just as obvious. Venezuela provides everything they need to become impossible for Colombia to defeat: territory, extortion opportunities, drug routes, training, weapons.\n\nFor Colombia, this state of affairs threatens to become simply intolerable. Some of the grimmest scenarios hardly stretch the imagination. Say, for instance, Colombia\u2019s intelligence learns of a guerrilla cell in Venezuela training for a major attack in Bogota: The case for a preemptive strike could quickly prove overwhelming. To be sure, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time Colombia has struck guerrillas in a neighbor\u2019s territory.\n\nFor years, Venezuela watchers have been muttering that the country\u2019s collapse was bound to destabilize the region one way or another. Now, the shape that destabilization is likely to take is beginning to come into focus.\n\nTo be sure, no sane Venezuelan leader could want an armed conflict that pits Venezuela\u2019s shambolic, underfed recruits against Colombia\u2019s much-better-armed, trained and battle-hardened fighters. It\u2019s not a winnable proposition.\n\nBut the presence of the guerrillas complicate any calculation: Venezuela wouldn\u2019t have to launch an invasion to get its forces into Colombia \u2014 its guerrilla allies are already there. Those same guerrillas multiply the potential for mistakes, miscalculations and accidents that could easily set off an escalation none of the players can bring under control.\n\nLatin America isn\u2019t prepared for the dynamic taking shape along the Venezuela-Colombia border. The region hasn\u2019t witnessed serious interstate conflict since the 1930s. Venezuela\u2019s wholehearted embrace of Colombia\u2019s narco-revolutionaries is creating conditions for a kind of clash the region has no memory of.\n\nWith luck, it\u2019s a scenario that will remain confined to the nightmares of reality-scarred Venezuelans. Except if there\u2019s one thing the past few years have made clear, it\u2019s that reality-scarred Venezuelans can\u2019t rely on luck.\n\nRead more:\n\nFrancisco Toro: Venezuela\u2019s implosion is becoming Colombia\u2019s security nightmare\n\nJackson Diehl: The Venezuela crisis is going to get much worse \u2014 and Trump will get the blame\n\nChris Murphy and Ben Rhodes: Democrats should stand for democracy in Venezuela \u2014 and democratic values in America\n\nAnne Applebaum: Venezuela is how \u2018illiberal democracy\u2019 ends", "description": "With luck, it\u2019s a scenario that will remain confined to the nightmares of reality-scarred Venezuelans.", "authors": ["Francisco Toro", "Francisco Toro Is A Venezuelan Political Commentator", "Contributing Columnist For Global Opinions.
