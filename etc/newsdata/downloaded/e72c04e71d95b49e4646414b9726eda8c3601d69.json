I think it's a sell. I think it's gone up more than five times this year. It's on an EV to EBITDA of about 100, which is very significant. The remuneration structure for me, I don't think that's best practice for shareholders. It's linked to revenue, not EPS growth or anything\n\ntangible for shareholders. It's obviously in the headlines for all the wrong\n\nreasons at the moment, so it's a sell.\n\nJumbo Interactive\n\nJames Marlay: Okay, next stop, Jumbo Interactive. There was a big\n\nPowerball last week. It got everyone excited about that. The stock\u2019s actually been around for a long time. It's been on a tear lately. Buy, hold or sell?\n\nRob Miller: Yeah, it's a sell for us as well. From an ESG perspective we don't own this business, but I think it's an excellent business. It's got great ROE and financial metrics, as well as big opportunity overseas. I'm just questionable of their execution risk and what's already priced in with the Tabcorp stuff.\n\nArden Jennings: Yeah. Some good points there by Rob. I think it's a\n\nhold. We do hold a very small portion of our holding within the\n\nfund. It's obviously been a fantastic winner and we've sold the majority\n\nof that position as the share price has run, just to take profits. Obviously\n\nthere's been a huge benefit from the change in the Powerball sequencing, but also the jackpot sizes with a very strong start to the quarter, particularly for FY20. So, in the very short term I think you can hold it a little longer,\n\nbut yeah, agree, the valuation is starting to look stretched.\n\nEML Payments\n\nJames Marlay: Okay. EML Payments, it's grown offshore, taking these cards for gift vouchers, all sorts of business like that. Buy, hold or sell?\n\nArden Jennings: Yeah, I think it's a buy. Plenty of structural growth drivers here, both with the reloadable cards and the opening up of the online gaming market in the US. So there's plenty of momentum within the business. The next catalyst is the upcoming AGM, where we're looking for an earnings update. We own the stock, we think it's a buy, and that we should get an earnings upgrade coming through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Marlay: Rob, have you've got a view? Buy, hold or sell?\n\nRob Miller: I agree there with Arden. Again, we don't own it, but I think it's a great business. It has great momentum coming out of FY19 into FY20. We've heard some great customer feedback that the product they offer in some of the areas is excellent. I think that's a great sign for the business. For us, it just comes down to an ESG perspective, but also you've got a key catalyst coming up at the AGM, so I think it's a buy.\n\nPhoslock\n\nJames Marlay: The next stock, I've been told, is on a PE of over 1000, Phoslock. Buy, hold or sell?\n\nRob Miller: For us it's a sell as well. It's a water treatment company. I\n\nthink you've got questionable relationships there in terms of the business visibility of where they're making their money. I also think obviously that valuation is very scary. It's a conceptual business, so you're investing on a concept rather than an underlying core business at the moment.\n\nJames Marlay: Management has been flushing some stock into the market lately. Phoslock, buy, hold or sell?\n\nArden Jennings: Yeah, definitely a sell for us too. They're operating\n\nin a segment of the market that should be quite attractive, cleaning up polluted waterways through their environmental treatment products. But, as you point out, there's been insider selling lately where they've trimmed their holdings. They've also got links with the Chinese state-owned enterprises, through the business, so there is some key man risk there.\n\nAfterpay\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Marlay: If we're talking overhyped and misunderstood, there's probably no better poster child for this segment than Afterpay. It's had people wrong-footed pretty much the whole story. The stock on the day of recording has added $800 million of market cap today. Buy, hold or sell on Afterpay?\n\nArden Jennings: We think there's still more to go. So, it's a buy. Obviously it's been a phenomenal success story within Australia and it's going into the 100, so it's no longer really a small cap for much longer. We believe their guidance for FY22 of hitting that $20 billion of GTV can definitely be exceeded. And also, the frequency of the customer usage as customers mature using the product and get used to it, we think that can surprise on the upside. So yes, the valuation looks stretched, but these are really large addressable markets they're operating in. The US has strong momentum and they're now into the UK. Management have executed fantastically. So the low hanging fruit has been picked, but we think there's probably more upside to buy.\n\nRob Miller: It's a sell for us. I agree with Arden's points on the US market and the total addressable market being very, very large. The key thing for us is I think the easy money has been made in this sector. You've got competitors now. It's almost a me-too game out there now with this buy now, pay later situation in Australia. Also, I think the consumer lending regulatory environment is ripe for some sort of review of some sort. There's the Austrac thing going on at the moment, but there might be more to come. Who knows? I think that's risky. So, for us it's a sell.\n\nJames Marlay: Okay. Well, divided opinions. That's why some of these stocks are on a tear, and some of them are being overlooked\n\nBuy Hold Sell is a weekly video series produced by Livewire Markets.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this presentation is general in nature and should not be relied upon.
