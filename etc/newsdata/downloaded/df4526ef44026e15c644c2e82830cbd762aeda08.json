It comes with a larger goal, he said: \u201cto highlight the fact that rescue is a problem\u201d and warn other nonprofit shelters and rescuers who do business in similar ways that they could be next.\n\nThe Aug. 8 order closes an investigation by the Pet Animal Care Facilities Act agency, an arm of the state Department of Agriculture, and comes about two months after HuffPost published a lengthy investigation into National Mill\u2019s business activities.\n\nThe order slaps National Mill with a $15,000 fine, $7,000 of which is due immediately and another $8,000 of which the state can collect should National Mill fail an inspection or violate PACFA rules during a one-year probationary period.\n\nThere will be unannounced inspections during the probationary period, and if National Mill fails any inspection or violates any of the agency\u2019s rules, it will also have its license to operate revoked.\n\nNational Mill, according to the order, \u201cadmits there is a factual basis\u201d for disciplinary proceedings and waives its rights to any hearing or appeal.\n\nThe order cites 15 regulatory violations, including importing dogs into Colorado without the required vaccinations and paperwork, failing to produce medical records, failing to produce a complete origin record for one dog, and transporting dogs and cats without a license. The order also describes two dogs, named Oscar and Jubilee, being \u201cseverely injured\u201d in dogfights at the facility.\n\nRead the full order below (story continues after):\n\nAdditional documents obtained by HuffPost through an open-records request show that PACFA inspectors noted far more than 15 violations at National Mill since 2017. But Nick Fisher, the agency\u2019s manager, said only 15 were cited in the final order because the agency felt National Mill had \u201cowned up\u201d to its compliance failures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if they can toe the line,\u201d Fisher told HuffPost. \u201cWe could\u2019ve fined them thousands and thousands of dollars, but they\u2019ve acknowledged that they\u2019ve done this, and we wanted to get a stipulation agreement in place that they agree to give up their license if they do it again in the future.\u201d\n\nTheresa Strader, the founder and executive director of National Mill who signed the final order on July 30, did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe Truth Comes Out\n\nThe strength of the state\u2019s action and the details of wrongdoing laid out in the inspectors\u2019 notes dramatically contradict the picture that Strader has been painting online for National Mill supporters and donors.\n\nIn the past month, instead of acknowledging that the nonprofit is now just a single regulatory violation away from being shut down, National Mill has been promoting a $125-per-person, black-tie-optional fundraising gala scheduled for Sept. 14 at The Broadmoor, a destination resort in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe nonprofit has made no mention of the PACFA investigation to its more than 660,000 Facebook followers since the state opened the inquiry in early January, after receiving a complaint from former National Mill marketing director Jene Nelson. Strader\u2019s first public comments about the situation related to HuffPost\u2019s then-upcoming article that included Nelson\u2019s allegations: On June 29, Strader told National Mill\u2019s Facebook followers that a story was about to be published \u201criddled with lies, bias and inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nFisher said that, to the contrary, his agency\u2019s inspectors found Nelson\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing to be correct. In fact, one inspector\u2019s notes from February state that when Strader told inspectors that Nelson\u2019s complaint \u201cwas submitted in an attempt to tarnish the facility due to an employment/volunteer dispute,\u201d National Mill\u2019s chief operations officer, Chuck Arnold, \u201cadvised her that that could not be the case when many of the allegations made in the complaint were true.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty much all the allegations she made were founded in our investigation,\u201d Fisher said of Nelson\u2019s complaint.\n\nNelson told HuffPost that she has only ever sought to have National Mill comply with animal welfare laws, including when she still worked there.\n\n\u201cI reported NMDR\u2019s irresponsible behavior to the chairman of the board nearly eight months before the PACFA complaint in an attempt to resolve issues internally, but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe action taken by PACFA might be the wake-up call NMDR has needed for a long time. ... NMDR is a multimillion-dollar organization and has every resource available to comply with those regulations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked about that meeting, Chris Thornton, chairman of National Mill\u2019s board, told HuffPost, \u201cShe did go ahead and express concerns, which I relayed to Theresa [Strader] and Kim Lehmann [another National Mill official]. I said Jene Nelson had contacted me and made these couple of claims. Theresa said, \u2018Thanks for letting us know.\u2019\u201d\n\nState documents also verify HuffPost\u2019s reporting that cast doubt on the description of a number of dogs supposedly rescued by National Mill. While the nonprofit tells supporters that its dogs are saved from \u201cpuppy mills,\u201d the government investigators determined that sometimes Strader has no idea who is handing over dogs to her \u2014 let alone whether they are breeders or how their kennels might be run.\n\nOn July 9, according to the state\u2019s records (in which Strader\u2019s first name is misspelled), \u201cTeresa stated that the name on the acquisition records was not who they had obtained the dogs from. Teresa advised that people in the area put word out that the rescue will be in town and random people show up with animals. I explained they are required to obtain name, address, and phone number for the individuals they obtain dogs from.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, PACFA sent Strader a letter that would form the basis for the final order, citing all the specific violations for which the agency would subsequently levy its significant fine and place the nonprofit on probation.\n\nA Warning To Other Rescue Groups\n\nFisher says he hopes the $15,000 fine serves as a warning to other nonprofits in Colorado that skirt the rules and regulations designed to keep animals and people safe.\n\n\u201cAnimals coming into the state of Colorado have increased from 17,000 in 2013 to almost 45,000 in 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of that is rescue.\u201d\n\nFisher suggested that some of the so-called rescue organizations are really just \u201cdog flipping\u201d as a way to make quick cash \u2015 he exempted National Mill from that particular criticism \u2015 and that regulations have not kept pace with the evolution of the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhat we see with a lot of these rescue groups is that it\u2019s an easy way to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou throw up a website, you\u2019re in business, you go to another state and get dogs, and you adopt them out. They don\u2019t have to put a lot of money into them if they get them from a shelter ... that just gives them a dog, and then here, they adopt them out for a $400 or $500 fee.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem is the halo effect around dog rescue, he added.\n\n\u201cRescues and shelters have such a positive connotation that everybody should get their dogs there,\u201d Fisher said, \u201cbut a lot of the stuff we see happening with these rescues and shelters is pretty bad. Our hope is that other rescue groups look at what happened to National Mill Dog and say, \u2018Well, I better get my act together, because if I don\u2019t and somebody files a complaint on me, I\u2019m going to be in trouble.\u2019\u201d\n\nAssessing The Inspectors\n\nThe documents in the National Mill case also raise questions about PACFA\u2019s ability to regulate dog rescues and shelters throughout Colorado, Fisher acknowledged.\n\nIn March 2017, inspectors had cited National Mill for transporting dogs across state lines without the required vaccinations and veterinary paperwork to prevent the spread of disease. State documents show that the inspectors didn\u2019t follow up and ask for further proof that National Mill had fixed the problem until after the agency received Nelson\u2019s complaint in January 2019 \u2014 and that once the inspectors did look, they found that National Mill had violated the same regulations and imported dozens more dogs into Colorado without the required veterinary forms in April, July and August 2017.\n\n\u201cWe regulate 2,200 facilities,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI\u2019m not making excuses, but each inspector has between 375 and 425 that they regulate on an annual basis, and they respond to 75 to 100 complaints a year. That\u2019s about 500 complaints a year plus any follow-up they have to do on a facility.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that in early 2017, after issuing a citation, the agency simply took Strader\u2019s word that National Mill would follow the law in the future.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s what we usually have to do unless we get a complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, Theresa lied, so here we go.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For National Mill\n\nAlthough PACFA\u2019s investigation into National Mill is now closed, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies also opened an investigation based on a separate complaint that Nelson filed early this year. That complaint alleges that Strader has been practicing veterinary medicine without a license and falsifying rabies vaccine certificates.\n\nThe department has referred that case to the state Attorney General\u2019s Office, which is reviewing it and deciding whether to prosecute.\n\nIn the meantime, the Colorado Board of Veterinary Medicine issued a cease-and-desist order to Strader for the unlicensed practice of veterinary medicine. Strader, through an attorney, denied the charges. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 30 at Colorado\u2019s Office of Administrative Courts.\n\nBeyond any action that the state attorney general or the Office of Administrative Courts may yet take, National Mill is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the federal Animal Welfare Act. Under that federal law (and many state statutes), dogs are required to have vaccinations and a certificate from a veterinarian before crossing state lines, to prevent the spread of diseases including rabies. HuffPost\u2019s reporting showed that while National Mill handled more than 2,000 dogs from at least six states and imported many of them into Colorado in 2017 and 2018, fewer than 100 such certificates were actually on file in the six states and only 168 certificates were on file in Colorado.\n\nFisher told HuffPost that he might also refer the case to the Department of Agriculture.", "description": "National Mill Dog Rescue faces the threat of losing its license in what officials say is a warning to similar operations.", "authors": ["Freelance Journalist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d0aaef02500004e12e94a2d.jpeg?cache=prj3rrpdgm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
