Dawn and dusk provide the backdrop to his ongoing Not Quite Light project, a study of transition in the environment around us, capturing the change of the old into the new. \u201cThe idea of the half-light,\u201d he says, \u201ctranslates into many ideas: those memories that aren\u2019t quite full in our brains, dreams you only half-remember.\u201d\n\nOn an August evening earlier this year, the Salford-based artist found himself sheltering from a downpour in central Manchester \u2013 \u201cIt was really bouncing off the pavements\u201d \u2013 and was drawn to the beauty of the scene around him. Stepping out of the dry and on to the bridge overlooking Deansgate station, he managed to take five or six photos on his iPhone 6s before the water stopped his finger working on the screen.\n\nHe almost didn\u2019t post the picture online \u2013 \u201crainy Manchester again\u201d \u2013 but when he did it was an instant hit on social media, with Stephen Fry comparing it to the work of LS Lowry. \u201cIt must speak to something within us who live within the city,\u201d says Buckley. \u201cI think it appeals to the essence of what people believe Manchester is, despite it being a dynamic, changing city: strength, industrialism, forward-thinking, there\u2019s always light in the dark \u2013 I think that\u2019s a very Mancunian attitude.\u201d Past and present coexist in the photograph. \u201cHuman beings pretty much carry on walking and behaving as they always did in rain: they stoop, they move fast. You can see the timeline between our Victorian selves and now \u2013 it\u2019s not just the buildings that are there, it\u2019s also the people. There\u2019s no individual that you could identify: they\u2019re all shapes and silhouettes, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nThe image is available to buy as a limited edition print at notquitelight.com", "description": "August 2019: the heavens open and Simon Buckley snaps the city in a summer downpour", "authors": ["Kathryn Bromwich"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3915bd700d0fcc25253c16170f3746703e089cb0/0_372_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f40126598b237663d6ba6af1545b54e1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
