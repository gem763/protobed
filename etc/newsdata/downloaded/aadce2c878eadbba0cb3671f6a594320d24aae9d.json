The question is: which ones on the market today are best?\n\nWhat Car?'s road test team has ranked them in descending order so you know which pick-ups are worth considering.\n\n9. Isuzu D-Max\n\nPrice: from \u00a320,229\n\nRating:\n\nThe Isuzu D-Max gets a D grade from the What Car? test team. The engine lacks refinement, the ride is wobbly and the interior feels drab\n\nThe D-Max is an award winner, collecting What Van?'s pick-up of the year for 2018 and 2019. Not that What Car? agrees, giving the model a two-star rating.\n\nUnlike other pick-ups in this list, it's available as a single or twin-cab, though most who want to use one as a passenger vehicle as well as a workhorse will need to go for the latter.\n\nA four-cylinder 1.9-litre diesel engine is the powerplant of choice, and it's quite tractor like. It clatters away under the bonnet and the vibrations are felt through the gear shifter and steering wheel. The only time you struggle to hear it is at motorway speeds - but only because a torrent of wind noise has engulfed your eardrums instead.\n\nRide quality is also worse than anything else in this list, with the D-Max struggling to regain its composure - though it's better with a load bay that's brimmed rather than empty. The body of the car leans in the slightest of turns, too.\n\nThe interior is pretty drab unless you go for the highest specification, though it does have one of the better payloads of vehicles here - capable of hauling up to 3,500kg.\n\n8. Fiat Fullback\n\nPrice: from \u00a320,995\n\nRating:\n\nFiat is one of the last brands you might think has a pick-up truck, but the Fullback has been on sale in the UK up until recently. It's likely the result of the brand's American ties with Chrysler, though the vehicle is widely based on the Mitsubishi L200\n\nFiat is possibly the last brand you'd think would produce a large bundling pick-up trucks, and the Fullback is from from the Italian firm's 500. In truth, what lies beneath is actually a double-cab Mitsubishi L200.\n\nUnder the bonnet is a 180bhp 2.4-litre diesel engine which isn't what you'd call refined, green or particularly ground breaking. That said, it will do a job.\n\nWhat Car?'s review team said the suspension is particularly bouncy when the load bay is empty and described the interior as 'decidedly drab' because of all the cheap plastics.\n\nHowever, these will wipe down easy and are difficult to damage, making the cabin durable if not all that delightful.\n\nAnother issue is the driving position (the same as the Mitsubishi); the seats are too high and the roofline low, meaning taller occupants will find it pretty cramped.\n\nIt also has the narrowest loading space of all the models tested and a 3,100kg towing capacity lags behind some of the competition.\n\nFiat has recently removed it from its range, but you can still get your hands on the highest spec models (priced around \u00a333,000) with \u00a38,000 discounts at the time of publishing.\n\n7. Mitsubishi L200\n\nPrice: from \u00a323,990\n\nRating:\n\nThe L200 is one of the longest running pick-ups in the UK. Unfortunately, the current model can't quite cut it against the best in class\n\nUnsurprisingly, considering they share the same chassis and engines, the L200 suffers from many of the same issues that make the Fiat Fullback the least appealing pick-up you can buy in the UK.\n\nA bouncy ride when the rear deck is unladen, cheap interior materials and a fairly limited engine range are consistent traits between the two cars.\n\nRear leg room isn't quite as good as the Fiat alternative due to the L200 having more padded seats and the power outputs of the diesel motors are slightly detuned in the Mitsubishi. That said, it does have some positive points.\n\nWhat Car? said being able to switch from all- to rear-wheel drive to save fuel and is an absolute bargain to lease compared with the Fullback.\n\n6. Toyota Hilux\n\nPrice: from \u00a324,225\n\nRating:\n\nThe Hilux is arguably the most well-known pick-up of them all, thanks to its famed reliability track record\n\nToyota's Hilux is one of the better known pick-ups. Famed for its reliability, which was tested almost to destruction by Jeremy Clarkson and the Top Gear old guard years ago, the latest generation model went on sale in Britain earlier this year.\n\nWhile it might have plenty of off-road credentials, its on-road performance is a little disappointing.\n\nNoisy at cruising speeds on motorways, a lack of cornering grip and - yet again - an overly sensitive bouncy ride when the load bay is empty. The engine is also under-powered, says What Car?.\n\nThere are other issues too. The cabin is narrow, meaning you clash elbows with other occupants, and the dashboard, controls and tech feel like it's been beamed in from the late 1990s.\n\nRedeeming qualities include a practical flatbed and one of the highest payload ratings of all vehicles here.\n\n5. Mercedes-Benz X-Class\n\nPrice: from \u00a335,238\n\nRating:\n\nMercedes entered the pick-up market in 2016, bringing premium brands to utilitarian vehicles. It's based on the Nissan Navara\n\nMercedes caused quite a stir back in 2016 when it announced it would be entering the pick-up market, becoming the first premium brand to offer a workhorse motor in this category.\n\nIt's broadly based on the Nissan Navara, though the three-point emblem comes at a premium in showrooms.\n\nCompared to the models already mentioned, it does a much better job of feeling car like, eliminating the lumpy ride quality and corners with more stability - though it's better in two-wheel drive model than when power is being sent to all four corners.\n\nA sole 2.3-litre diesel engine is available in two outputs: 161bhp or 187bhp. Both are refined and grunty enough.\n\nAs expected, it feels classier inside than the rest of the competition. However, with prices rising as high as \u00a347,500, it's far pricier than others in this list.\n\n4. Nissan Navara\n\nPrice: from \u00a324,600\n\nRating:\n\nThe Nissan Navara is another long established pick-up. It loses points for a lack of driving dynamics\n\nConsidering the Mercedes X-Class is mechanically almost identical to the Nissan Navara, it might be hard to swallow the \u00a310,000 premium you have to pay for the German model.\n\nThe Nissan comes with a choice of 2.3-litre diesel motors either with a single or twin turbo. What Car? says the latter is powerful and frugal, though a bit noisy.\n\nRoad test feedback also reported heavy and low steering and the suspension's failure to soak up potholes. The Navara also suffers a little from body lean in corners.\n\nInside, it's no match for the Mercedes but does feature a lot of the sturdy switchgear from Nissan's road cars.\n\nPayload - which is vital for a vehicle like this - is good, as is interior room.\n\n3. Ssangyong Musso\n\nPrice: from \u00a325,199\n\nRating:\n\nSsangyong won't be the first brand you'll think of in this class but the Musso is a serious contender\n\nDidn't think you'd see a Ssangyong out-score a Mercedes in a test did you? But the South Korean firm's pick-up is a surprisingly good choice if you're in the market for a workhorse 4x4.\n\nLike most other vehicles here, the engine line-up is limited to say the least. There's only a 2.2-litre diesel unit available in one power output, which might seem small against rivals.\n\nThat said, What Car? testers vouched that it pulls well and stays smooth at all times.\n\nA negative point is the ride, which is the least comfortable of all the contenders as Ssangyoung has made the suspension exceptionally stiff to cope with the extra weight customers might be transporting in the load bed - which is also pretty short.\n\nThe cabin is finished with plenty of soft-touch plastics and even entry-level versions have a DAB radio with Bluetooth as standard.\n\n2. Ford Ranger\n\nPrice: from \u00a325,014\n\nRating:\n\nFord's Ranger has the best range of engines of all the models here. High spec versions are well equipped\n\nAll the models mentioned so far in the list have fairly limited engine ranges - but not the Ranger.\n\nFord's pick-up comes with a choice of four powerplants. Three are 2.0-litre diesel engines in varying power outputs while there's also a 3.2-litre motor. Anything but the least potent of the bunch are more than good enough for daily use.\n\nEngine noise is said to be a little loud, though the Ranger does a good job of cutting wind and road noise. It also doesn't suffer from the awful ride quality that rivals do.\n\nWhat helped it rank at number two is the driving characteristics, which are class leading - very much like Ford's passenger-car range.\n\nHigh-end models get leather seats and Ford's latest Sync 3 infotainment system.\n\n1. Volkswagen Amarok\n\nPrice: from \u00a332,739\n\nRating:\n\nVW's Amarok is the standout performer. The 3.0-litre V6 engine is smooth, punchy and quiet\n\nThe standout pick-up for British customers is the Volkswagen Amarok - the only vehicle in this category to receive a coveted five-star rating from What Car?'s road test squad.\n\nLike most of the models here, it's only available as a twin-cab with four doors, and the engine line up is a single 3.0-litre V6 diesel, though with three different power outputs.\n\nAll powerplants are quiet, punchy and smooth - far from the agricultural motors in some of the lesser rated vehicles.\n\nInside, the infotainment system is far and away better than the rest and the cabin has the most space.\n\nIt also has the widest load bed, a high payload and driving characteristics that are on par with VW's range of SUVs.", "description": "Pick-up trucks are synonymous with the US and Australian outback, but more Britons buy them today than any other time on record.
