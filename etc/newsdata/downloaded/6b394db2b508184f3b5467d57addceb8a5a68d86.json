The repeated failure to win gold in 2002, 2004 and 2006 was the last time that USA Basketball found itself at the crossroads that it\u2019s suddenly facing before next summer\u2019s Olympics. That reckoning brought about the Redeem Team in 2008, and the U.S. hadn\u2019t lost since then.\n\nBut the problem is that the best American players no longer seem interested in playing basketball pro bono at a time when the rest of the world is only getting better.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the fault of the players on the team. Gregg Popovich and USA Basketball weren\u2019t to blame, either. It was simply a reflection of a league that has changed dramatically since the last World Cup five years ago. That\u2019s why an upset in the first game of the knockout round wasn\u2019t humiliating in the way that past American losses have felt like international embarrassments. This one seemed almost inevitable.\n\nThe big question now is whether a sense of urgency will return in time for the 2020 Olympics\u2014or whether this marked the end of an era of American basketball hegemony.\n\nThis surprisingly uncertain era of USA Basketball began in a gruesome way one night in 2014. Paul George hustled back to defend a fast-break layup in a meaningless intrasquad scrimmage, and this admirable play would have a scarring psychic effect across the league. George crashed into the basket stanchion and broke his leg in a grisly visual reminder of the risks that NBA players assume when they suit up for their country without getting paid. It had been cool to play for Team USA. Now it seemed foolish.\n\nGeorge returned to play in 2016 with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson. But for the first time since 2004, when a lackluster roster prompted USA Basketball to rethink the identity of the national team, the team was defined by who wasn\u2019t playing and not who was. Team USA went to Rio de Janeiro without LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook. They struggled in the group stage against Australia, squeaked past Serbia and barely survived a pesky French team before they recovered to win their third straight gold medal.\n\nBy the time France pulled off the upset on Wednesday, though, Team USA losing was not entirely unexpected for something that almost never happens.\n\nIn his first summer coaching the U.S. national squad, Gregg Popovich took a junior-varsity Team USA to China. The biggest NBA stars once again decided to skip this competition and enjoy their summer vacations instead. It has become trickier in recent years to convince players of their caliber to volunteer in their spare time out of patriotic spirit. That\u2019s not just because the image of George\u2019s injury is seared in their minds. It\u2019s also because they are increasingly mindful of rest and recovery at a time when the Toronto Raptors just won the NBA title in part because Kawhi Leonard didn\u2019t play in a quarter of their regular-season games.\n\nGregg Popovich took a junior-varsity Team USA to China.

There is precedent for the U.S. tapping the next generation of players and using this tournament as a farm system for the next Olympics. But even by those standards, this American roster was vulnerable.\n\nThis tournament was the first time since before the Dream Team that the Americans didn\u2019t have the best player (Greece\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo). As if that weren\u2019t strange enough, they also didn\u2019t have the second best player (Serbia\u2019s Nikola Jokic). They might not have even had the third best player (France\u2019s Rudy Gobert).\n\nTeam USA had more NBA starters than stars, and it showed. The Americans were still the favorites, but there had never been less of a talent gap between them and the rest of the planet. They lost to Australia in an exhibition last month. They probably should have lost to Turkey last week. And they did lose to France on Wednesday.\n\nThe most remarkable thing was not that it happened but how it happened. As most Americans pretended to be European by watching basketball as they brewed their morning coffee, Team USA found itself down 10 in the third quarter on the brink of elimination. That\u2019s when Donovan Mitchell began to play as if he\u2019d chugged a triple espresso. He scored all 29 of his points in the first three quarters and brought Team USA back as they took a seven-point lead in the fourth quarter after the single most impressive run of their summer. It was a characteristically American performance.\n\nBut as in every other part of life, the French were not impressed.\n\nRudy Gobert took advantage of Team USA\u2019s glaring weakness and bullied the undersized Americans.

Evan Fournier looked like one of those mysterious international players who magically seems to make every shot against the U.S. and not someone who\u2019s on the Orlando Magic. Gobert feasted on Team USA\u2019s undersized lineups and was so dominant that the French were +26 in 34 minutes with him and -16 in 6 minutes without him.\n\nThe glaring weaknesses of Team USA revealed themselves at the worst possible time. They didn\u2019t have someone like Durant, James or Kobe Bryant to bend the game to his will, and they didn\u2019t have the shooting to compensate for not having size. With their margin for error already minuscule, Team USA went 4-of-11 from the free-throw line and 1-of-5 from the 3-point line in the fourth quarter, and they went from down 10 to up seven to down 10 again as the buzzer sounded.\n\nIt was a painful reminder that international basketball is beautiful in its own funky way. The games are shorter, the court is smaller and the style of play is tougher. It\u2019s a sport in which a team consisting entirely of NBA players can lose to a team in which more than half the roster plays overseas.\n\nThis is because NBA basketball and FIBA basketball are like spinach and kale. They look similar. But they taste and feel completely different. And one is beginning to leave a bitter taste for the Americans.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Will the U.S. team struggle to win a medal at next summer\u2019s Olympics if the best players opt not to play?
