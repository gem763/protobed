Utility spokeswoman Ari Vanrenen said Tuesday that the utility began the process of shutting off power early Tuesday to about 46,000 customers in Butte, Tehama, Plumas, Trinity and Shasta counties. There are about 2.5 people for every customer, meaning about 115,000 people are affected. Vanrenen says power could be cut later Tuesday to 596,000 customers in 29 counties. That would affect 1.5 million people. Some Californians are preparing to be left in the dark for five days or longer in the blackouts. Across the region, it was clear that patience was wearing thin and frustration at the utility was growing. Southern California Edison had cut off power to about 800 people as of Monday night and warned that it was considering disconnecting about 400,000 more as winds return midweek.

'I would love to say this is the first time it has happened, but this is the third year in a row in October that wine country has experienced this.'\n\nThe Kincade fire is particularly hard to contain due to the steep topography of the densely forested hills its concentrated in.\n\nSmall fires have contributed to the overall fire catastrophe ravaging California. On Sunday a grass fire broke out along the I-5 highway in Natomas near Sacramento, torching cars and sending local scrambling on foot for safety.\n\nGood Samaritan Gerald Contreras recorded the chaos along the highway where the median caught ablaze. In the harrowing footage he guides trapped drivers to drive through a cut hole in a wire fence to escape the blazing road.\n\n'The median actually caught fire and I think that's what scared a lot of people. So, a lot of the cars were trying to get away from the median and they were going to the shoulder. And then the fire caught on the shoulder as well and they were trapped,' Contreras said to ABC10.\n\n'Fortunately, everybody got out OK. There was nobody hurt other than a few cars,' Contreras added.\n\n.
