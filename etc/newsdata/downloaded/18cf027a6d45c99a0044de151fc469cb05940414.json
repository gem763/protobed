(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nIt might help him turn the page and win reelection.\n\nThe Ukraine story hasn\u2019t been good for President Donald Trump, and there\u2019s only one way out \u2014 to get impeached, and the sooner, the better.\n\nTrump obviously hates the idea of being impeached. He thinks it\u2019s unfair, and he\u2019s raging against the process with every political and legal argument his team can muster and every insult and countercharge he can make on Twitter. But he doesn\u2019t have any choice in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImpeachment is baked in the cake. There\u2019s no way that Democrats, having opened an impeachment inquiry (although without a vote), can pull up short now. How could they, after touting revelation after revelation, including a supposed \u201cconfession\u201d by Trump\u2019s chief of staff? If there are Democrats in swing districts holding the House back from impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have no option but to twist their arms to get to a majority when the time comes.\n\nTrump should want it to come as soon as possible. Ukraine news has been bad news for him. The phone call with the Ukrainian president was clearly inappropriate and alarmed all sorts of insiders at the time. There was, at the very least, the thought of squeezing Ukraine by withholding defense aid, although the ploy might have had multiple motives and may never have been carried out (it seems Ukrainian officials didn\u2019t know the aid had been blocked until shortly before it was released). And Rudy Giuliani\u2019s political and business maneuverings in Ukraine are a worrisome black box.\n\nAs impeachment rumbles on, it puts every Trump lapse (Syria, Doral, etc.) in starker relief and places it in the context of the question of whether he should be impeached and removed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, if support for impeachment is about 50 percent or a little higher, there\u2019s every reason for Democrats to stretch it out. The current process suits their purposes nicely. They interview officials in private and then leak the most damaging parts. There\u2019s no danger of public hearings bouncing the wrong way . . . because there are no public hearings.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry also has the advantage of giving the Democratic base what it wants and creating a strong sense of action against Trump. When Republicans took the House in the middle of Barack Obama\u2019s first term, they had trouble controlling the expectations of their own base, which wanted immediate results when the GOP had limited power. Impeachment allows Democrats to forestall such a feeling among their own voters, even though they, too, aren\u2019t getting anything substantive done.\n\nThis suggests that, as of this moment, Pelosi looks to have judged the politics of impeachment shrewdly, holding off when it still seemed politically premature and striking when the prospect of moving the needle of public opinion presented itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven how impeachment is playing, she should welcome the White House\u2019s reliance on the normal strategy in these fights: attempting to frustrate and delay the inquiry. Not only is this standard approach not fully working \u2014 former and current officials are talking to House investigators regardless \u2014 but at the margins it lengthens an inquiry that\u2019s working for the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s always possible the public will tire of the probe, especially if it reaches past the first month or two of an election year.\n\nWhat can Trump do about any of this? Absent a mea culpa and a promise of full transparency, which aren\u2019t in the cards for temperamental reasons if nothing else, Trump can\u2019t change the dynamic or the timing. But he should be secretly rooting for the rapid arrival of Impeachment Day (and the near-inevitable acquittal in the Senate).\n\nIt will be one of the biggest stories of the Trump presidency. Then, like everything else, it will grow old very fast. Impeachment won\u2019t be forgotten, but it will fade into part of the tapestry of endless Trump controversies and outrages, from Charlottesville to his Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats will believe that they struck a decisive blow against Trump, when they really may have helped him turn the page.\n\n\u00a9 2019 by King Features Syndicate", "description": "Trump should be secretly rooting for the rapid arrival of Impeachment Day (and the near-inevitable acquittal in the Senate).
