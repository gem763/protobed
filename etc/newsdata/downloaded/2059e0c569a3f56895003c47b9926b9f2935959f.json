This was May 1971, the original D.C. traffic blockade launched to protest the Vietnam War \u2014 what longtime organizer and historian L.A. Kauffman calls \u201cthe most influential protest you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d\n\n\u2033It contributed to helping end the Vietnam War and pioneered a new model of organizing that would shape movement after movement in the decades to come,\u201d Kauffman said in a phone interview with The Washington Post. \u201cMay Day 71 was a crucial turning point in our history.\u201d\n\n'Climate rebels' shut down intersections across D.C.\n\nGovernment records show that officials of President Richard Nixon\u2019s administration were so spooked by the massive action that it hastened their withdrawal from Vietnam, Kauffman said. And in the years following May Day, activists across the country adopted the demonstration\u2019s guiding principles, Kauffman said: that movements should be decentralized; should revolve around small, autonomous groups; and should involve participants hailing from all kinds of ideologies.\n\nThe protest also featured another notable American landmark: Thanks to what Kauffman calls a \u201cmassive overreaction\u201d from the Nixon administration, more than 7,000 protesters were arrested in a day. It was the largest mass arrest in U.S. history, according to Kauffman.\n\nIn a text, 2019 Shut Down D.C. organizer Liz Butler confirmed that May Day 1971 served as inspiration for her coalition\u2019s modern version. Thai Jones, a professor at the University of Columbia who studies radical social movements, told The Post it makes historical sense that climate activists today would adopt the tactics of anti-Vietnam War protesters in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nPeople only resort to massive, disruptive activities like a traffic blockade when they\u2019ve reached \u201can extreme level of frustration,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to people from the \u201960s, they will say climate change is today\u2019s Vietnam,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis parallel works on many, many levels. One of them is the sense, at this point, of just extreme dismay that every conceivable and plausible form of activism has failed to move the needle.\u201d\n\nA similarly pervasive sense of despair inspired the May Day 1971 protests, according to Kauffman.\n\nA year beforehand, the Nixon administration had directed the military to invade Cambodia, spurring outrage across the country and prompting students at more than 100 colleges and universities to conduct walkouts, Kauffman said. By the end of May 1970, Kauffman estimates, more than half of the United States\u2019 student population had probably taken part in antiwar demonstrations.\n\nBut Washington didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention. The United States was still deeply entangled in the Vietnam War \u2014 fought between 1955 and 1975 in a bid to eradicate communism from that country, costing hundreds of thousands of lives \u2014 and seemed likely to get more involved.\n\nThe day the anti-Vietnam War protesters tried to levitate the Pentagon\n\n\u201cAn air of futility hung over the established antiwar movement. \u2026 It seemed that everything had been tried, and nothing had worked,\u201d Kauffman wrote of the period in her book, \u201cDirect Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism.\u201d Kauffman quoted one 1960s-era protester who, tired of the endless, apparently useless demonstrations, wondered, \u201cShould I take pictures \u2026 or would photographs from past identical rallies suffice?\u201d\n\nMay Day came at the right moment \u2014 a shot of adrenaline that pumped fresh life into a rapidly flagging movement, according to Kauffman. It was something new and bold. No one had ever successfully shut down the streets of a major U.S. city before. (Although the Congress of Racial Equality unsuccessfully tried it at the 1964 World\u2019s Fair in New York City, an event that served as a model for May Day protesters, Kauffman said.)\n\nThe May Day Tribe \u2014 as the traffic disrupters called themselves \u2014 was largely the brainchild of Rennie Davis, a \u201cNew Left\u201d organizer who rose to prominence after being arrested by the FBI for protesting outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Kauffman said. The movement attracted a variety of young people from across the country, who found out about it through speeches or mailed pamphlets. It wasn\u2019t all hippies, but the tribe definitely \u201chad a long-haired freaky flavor,\u201d Kauffman wrote in her book.\n\nThe central idea \u2014 and May Day Tribe slogan \u2014 was simple: \u201cIf the government won\u2019t stop the war, we\u2019ll stop the government.\u201d Movement pamphlets promised something new and effective. \u201cThe overall discipline will be nonviolent, the tactic disruptive, the spirit joyous and creative,\u201d reads one, quoted by Kauffman in her book. Other leaflets showed repeated images of Gandhi standing with one fist raised, according to Kauffman.\n\nAnother novel feature was the lack of a central command. Davis may have started the group, but the protest operated without a main leader. Instead, it split into small cadres of 5 to 15 people called \u201caffinity groups,\u201d Kauffman said.\n\nThis strategy had several advantages: Individual groups could more flexibly respond to difficult situations, and it would be difficult for federal officials to identify and blame any single top organizer. Plus, \u201cit\u2019s easier to avoid infiltration and disruption by the authorities when you organize in a decentralized way,\u201d Kauffman said.\n\nProtesters began arriving in Washington in late April and set up camp in West Potomac Park.\n\nAs they waited for the big event, campers partied around bonfires, some using marijuana and harder drugs, such as acid. As people continued to pour in \u2014 at one point, the camp reached 45,000 people, according to Kauffman \u2014 organizers put on at least one rock concert.\n\nThings soon got out of hand. Claims of sexual harassment spiked, Kauffman wrote. At one point, Nixon sent troops to shut down the encampment, scaring at least half of the protesters into heading home, according to Kauffman.\n\nThey attacked a draft board office to protest the Vietnam War. Fifty years later, the fallout continues.\n\nStill, a sizable number \u2014 roughly 25,000 \u2014 stayed behind and began pouring onto D.C. streets on the morning of May 3. The May Day Tribe had identified 21 vital traffic circles and bridges across the capital, Kauffman wrote, and bands of protesters headed to their designated sites. Along the way, they grabbed whatever materials they could find to serve as makeshift barricades. Supplies included lumber, nails and parked cars, according to the New York Times.\n\nPolice were waiting.\n\nThe Nixon administration had obtained a copy of the May Day Tribe\u2019s tactical plan, according to Kauffman, and had made its own preparations. Nixon deployed a massive amount of manpower: 12,000 federal troops, 5,100 police officers and 1,500 National Guardsmen, the New York Times reported.\n\nFederal troops arranged themselves on the Key Bridge, helicopters appeared near the Washington Monument, and a Marine battalion \u2014 its large guns pointing toward the street \u2014 encircled Dupont Circle, Kauffman reported in her book.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it that has happened before or since, it was essentially a military operation,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cThen it became a sweep operation, where anybody and everybody who looked like they might have any relationship to the protest was just swept up off the streets.\u201d\n\nAs the thousands of arrests piled up, officials soon ran out of space in the city jail. They began transporting protesters to a practice field near RFK Stadium, where conditions were abysmal: muddy, cold and without food or blankets, according to Kauffman. (The vast majority, charged with disorderly conduct, were let go before their cases could come to trial, according to WETA.)\n\nUltimately, the protesters failed to stop traffic for long, Kauffman wrote. Federal employees still made their way to work: Some battled through blockades, while others arose before dawn to reach the office. Three members of Congress actually paddled to work across the Potomac, according to Kauffman.\n\n\u2018Shut Down D.C.\u2019: What you need to know about the protests that are creating gridlock in Washington\n\nImmediate reviews of the day were far from favorable.\n\n\u201cIt was universally panned as the worst planned, worst executed, most slovenly, strident and obnoxious peace action ever committed,\u201d columnist Mary McGrory wrote of May Day 1971 in the Boston Globe. Even Davis admitted at a later news conference that the traffic blockade had failed, according to Kauffman.\n\nAs time went on, historians largely forgot the protest. Kauffman said that may be because \u201cit raised the specter of a revolution in the United States \u2014 a really profound breakdown in society \u2014 that people just didn\u2019t want to dwell on.\u201d Jones said he is unsure why it disappeared from Americans\u2019 collective memory.\n\nRelegated to the historical dustbin, for whatever reason, the blockade nonetheless in some way \u201cinfluenced most American protest movements since,\u201d Kauffman wrote in her book \u2014 culminating most obviously in the 2019 climate shut down.\n\nJones said it is impossible to guess whether this year\u2019s climate blockade will achieve the same long-term success as its predecessor. It may spur the Trump administration to take action on climate change \u2014 or it may do nothing beyond frustrate D.C. commuters for a morning.\n\n\u201cThe way history works, you just can never really predict what will be the crucial point of pressure,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou never know the tipping point until later.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nShut Down D.C.: \u2018Climate rebels\u2019 shut down intersections across the District\n\nWhat you need to know about the protests that created gridlock in Washington\n\nGreta Thunberg vows that if world leaders don\u2019t tackle climate change, \u2018we will never forgive you\u2019\n\nMichelle Williams\u2019s Emmy speech on pay equity and power is an instant classic", "description": "A protest regarded as unsuccessful and forgotten is nonetheless seen as a blueprint for movements that followed, and is credited with spurring action by the Nixon administration.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
