Rebecca Millett, of Cape Elizabeth, feels the U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if the vaping products are safe to use, the Portland Press Herald reported . Millett said there isn\u2019t enough research on the products to determine how dangerous they are.\n\nShe\u2019s making the proposal after more than 500 people have been sickened in the country with illnesses stemming from vaping. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced the state\u2019s first case of the lung illness a week ago.\n\nAt least nine deaths have been blamed on vaping around the country, although the exact cause of the illness has not been determined.\n\nMillett said she plans to submit her vaping legislation later this year, in time for January\u2019s legislative session. She was among the sponsors of a successful bill that banned vaping products from school properties in Maine.\n\nMassachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has declared a public health emergency in his state and announced a four-month moratorium on vaping sales. Other states have also taken steps to curb or restrict vaping.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A state senator in Maine announced plans to introduce a bill to ban the sale of vaping products in the wake of concerns about illnesses and deaths stemming from them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
