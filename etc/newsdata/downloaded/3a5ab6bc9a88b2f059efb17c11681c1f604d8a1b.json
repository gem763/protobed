At some point during the turmoil, the gunman abandoned the car and stole the postal vehicle, killing Granados. Police finally used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle.\n\nHere are stories about some of Saturday\u2019s other victims:\n\nEdwin Peregrino\n\nPeregrino, 25, ran into the yard of his parents\u2019 Odessa home to investigate after hearing gunshots, his sister, Eritizi Peregrino, told The Washington Post.

Nathan and Leilah were shot while walking out of the dealership, her grandmother, Nora Leyva, told the Post.\n\n\u201cI guess he was just looking for someone to kill,\u201d she said.\n\nLeyva said Leilah\u2019s mother pushed Leilah\u2019s 9-year-old brother under a car. Nathan wrapped his arms around Leilah and was shot in the arm. Another bullet struck Leilah near her collarbone. \u201cHelp me, help me,\u201d the girl said as she died, Leyva said.\n\nLeilah, an Odessa High School student, celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May. \u201cIt was like a dream for her,\u201d Leyva said.\n\nRadical gun reform may finally have a voice in Washington Read more\n\nOdessa High\u2019s school district, the Ector County independent school district, didn\u2019t name Leilah but said one of its students was among those killed.\n\nJoseph Griffith\n\nGriffith was killed while sitting at a traffic light with his wife and two children, his oldest sister, Carla Byrne, told the Post.\n\n\u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother. Like nothing,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cWe are so broken.\u201d\n\nByrne said Griffith, 40, worked six days a week to support his family. He was known for his sense of humour and an uncanny ability to impersonate people. Griffith previously worked as a math teacher.

Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nDaniel Munoz\n\nMunoz, 28, who was injured, recalled the harrowing details of coming into the path of the gunman, who was later killed by officers. Munoz was in his car on the way to meet a friend for a drink, when he yielded to a car coming off Interstate 20. He immediately noticed what he feared to be a barrel of a rifle in the hands of the driver.\n\n\u201cThis is my street instincts: When a car is approaching you and you see a gun of any type, just get down,\u201d Munoz, who moved from San Diego about a year ago to work in oil country, told The Associated Press. \u201cLuckily I got down. ... Sure enough, I hear the shots go off. He let off at least three shots on me.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not exactly sure, but it appears one shot hit the engine, another struck the driver\u2019s side window and a third a rear window. Some shattered glass punctured his left shoulder, causing him to bleed a lot and go to a nearby hospital. He said he\u2019s physically OK but bewildered by the experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to turn the corner and I got shot \u2014 I\u2019m getting shot at?\u201d Munoz said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the world coming to? For real? I\u2019m just over here minding my own business, getting my own gas.\u201d\n\nAnderson Davis\n\nTexas\u2019 governor Greg Abbott said 17-month-old Anderson is recovering but she faces surgery on Monday to remove shrapnel from her right chest. She also suffered injuries to her face.\n\nAbbott says her mother, Kelby Davis, texted: \u201cHer mouth is pretty bad, but will heal and can be fixed. Thankfully it doesn\u2019t seem like her jaw was hit. Just lips, teeth and tongue. ... We are thanking God for healing her and appreciate continued prayers.\u201d\n\nA joint public statement issued by the Davis family offered thanks to emergency responders, hospital staff and \u201cstrangers who offered to help us on the street\u201d.\n\nAbbott says the girl\u2019s mother also texted: \u201cToddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play.\u201d", "description": "As the US mourns its latest mass shooting, human stories of the carnage in Odessa are coming to light", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d8e7bc6452d0850e4ee7cbee865a228967ae98a/0_65_3922_2354/master/3922.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50d69969951402b3d5e3c4e7159cd79f"}
