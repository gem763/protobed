However, his government was forced to acknowledge in the UK parliament on Tuesday that a delay was inevitable.\n\nDonald Tusk, the European Council president, on Tuesday said he would recommend to heads of state and government that he would recommend that they sign off the UK\u2019s request for an extension until January 31.\n\n\u201cFollowing PM\u2019s decision to pause the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal #Brexit, I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFor this I will propose a written procedure.\u201d\n\nIt came after MPs approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle, but rejected the government\u2019s timetable which could have fast-tracked the legislation into law by the end of the week.\n\nIf passed, the motion would have forced MPs to hold 12-hour sessions and sit at the weekend in order to secure parliamentary approval for key pieces of Brexit legislation in time for the Halloween exit date.\n\nJohnson said he was disappointed by the decision to delay passage of his deal and would therefore \u201cpause\u201d the legislation so that he could speak to EU leaders about how to proceed.\n\nHe told MPs: \u201cI must express my disappointment that the House has again voted for delay rather than a timetable that would have guaranteed that the UK would be in a position to leave the EU on October 31 with a deal.\n\n\u201cAnd we now face further uncertainty and the EU must now make up their minds over how to answer Parliament\u2019s request for a delay.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - France could stop Britain from being granted another long Brexit delay after Prime Minister Boris Johnson shelved his deal with the EU..
