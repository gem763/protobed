The country\u2019s extensive equatorial forests are home to numerous species of venomous snakes, but their habitat is shared by secluded communities that are being forced to look further and further afield for their resources due to poverty and the pressures of conflict and climate change.\n\nIt puts DRC at the centre of an issue M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has called a \u201cneglected crisis\u201d: death by snake bite.\n\nGlobally, about 5m snake bites occur worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization, resulting in between 81,000 and 138,000 deaths. A bite from a viper, cobra or mamba can kill in a matter of hours or leave a victim suffering life-changing injury. Symptoms of snakebite envenomation commonly include tissue necrosis, intense pain and nausea. Beyond treatments that provide symptomatic relief, specialised antidotes are vital in counteracting the venom.\n\nSince the deadliest snakes often share habitats with rural populations that lack adequate healthcare, the victims of this crisis are often underprivileged people with no access to anti-venoms. DRC\u2019s remote tropical forests provide the perfect habitat for the country\u2019s venomous species, but they also make essential medical intervention nearly impossible.\n\n\u201cThe river is the gateway to finding many of them,\u201d explains Fran\u00e7ois Nsingi, a technical assistant with the University of Kinshasa\u2019s centre for anti-venom. The Congo river and its tributaries are a key habitat for venomous species, he says, as snakes hunt for fish and birds along the banks.\n\nNsingi keeps snakes for use in DRC\u2019s severely underfunded anti-venom programme. Snakes are rare around Kinshasa, he says, but heading down to the waters of the Congo and deeper into the bush, interactions between snakes and humans are far more common \u2013 as are problems.\n\nWhile death after a snakebite is not inevitable, lack of knowledge regarding basic treatments and poor access to anti-venom means that venomous snakes pose a severe threat to remote communities, especially those whose daily work by rivers and fields places them in snake habitats.\n\nDRC\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and lack of funding is the biggest obstacle to adequate in-country anti-venom production, with extremely limited stocks of anti-venom imported from Mexico available in the capital, but totally inaccessible in the rest of the huge nation.\n\nIn the office of the anti-venom centre, Sophie Bokuta, the secretary of operations, explains the reality of local scientific work: \u201cAt this time we don\u2019t have the money to produce serums or to distribute them around the country \u2026 we are researching some international funds to get work back ahead and raise the Congo office up\u201d.\n\nIn comparison, countries such as Costa Rica and India, with comparable dangerous snake species in their ecosystems, have advanced programmes for studying venom and producing antidotes.\n\nIn DRC\u2019s north-western \u00c9quateur province, characterised by winding rivers and dense, lush jungle, rural lifestyles put inhabitants at constant risk of snakebites. Fishermen frequently come into contact with venomous snakes. Patrick Atelo, who has fished in \u00c9quateur province\u2019s Ruki river for years, says that he meets snakes every day, but that they are not aggressive towards people: \u201cThey don\u2019t attack unless they feel in danger \u2026 you get bitten by accident if you step on his tail [or you find] them in your nets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poison affected my whole body,\u201d Monique Dongo recounts, \u201cI could barely remember who I was.\u201d Dongo, bitten while inspecting her rural property, is a survivor of envenomation. While she was lucky, she has seen snakebites kill others, including members of her own family.\n\nHer young nephew began to vomit and faint after he was bitten while playing outdoors, and passed away just hours later.\n\nScientists pursue universal snakebite cure using HIV antibody techniques Read more\n\nDue to the inaccessibility of anti-venom, many people in DRC rely on traditional healers. The remedies provided by these healers include making cuts, using charred powders and constricting wounds. These practices can be harmful.\n\nFunctional infrastructure is the first step to a solution, but a more realistic sense of the scale of the problem is also required. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any [local] data on snakebites,\u201d says Dr Guy Kalambayi of the World Health Organization\u2019s \u00c9quateur office. \u201cIf we had facts \u2026 then we could resolve the situation\u201d. The logistics and terrain of much of DRC means snakebites often go unrecorded. Given the ultra-specialised medicines required, template methods for dealing with a tropical health crisis can\u2019t simply be deployed here.\n\nDRC, with it\u2019s barely functional state system, is an extreme example. But with national and international health aid overstretched, this issue is a global one, found wherever tropical forests and rural communities overlap.\n\nThis story was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting", "description": "Daily life is fraught with danger for people living in remote areas of a country where health funding is as scarce as specialist medicine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af341c08a9924fb3bfcb9d32ea78f252cbda470a/0_374_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d3c8a21e88ce58314544bccee8ebb73", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
