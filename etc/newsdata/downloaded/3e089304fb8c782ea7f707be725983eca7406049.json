And rightfully so. After years of fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with their Kurdish brothers in arms, President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE\u2019s surprise withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria amounts to an unconscionable betrayal of key American allies.\n\nTrump\u2019s impulsive decision handed Turkey the green light to slaughter the Kurds, an ethnic group that mounted the only effective ground campaign against the depraved barbarism of the Islamic State. If selling out America\u2019s closest non-state allies was not bad enough, Trump\u2019s rash move destroyed U.S. credibility on the battlefield.\n\nLocal non-state groups, often critical to securing U.S. national security objectives, will have serious doubts about trusting American troops and intelligence officers in the future. In short, the long-term security implications of Trump\u2019s impulsive withdrawal are enormous. Frantic attempts to backtrack are far too little, too late.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds to an Ottoman slaughter amounted to a shameful \u201cwag the dog\u201d-style distraction from the enormous scandal engulfing his presidency. The media frenzy that followed Trump\u2019s withdrawal served as a Roy Cohn-worthy diversion from his (per Fox News) \u201ccriminal and impeachable\u201d behavior. Indeed, the inexplicable nature of Trump\u2019s Syria retreat proved just as baffling as his decision to (corruptly) withhold crucial military aid to Ukraine.\n\nDespite the monumental pitfalls of Trump\u2019s Syria drawdown, the eventual departure of U.S. troops from northern Syria represents a coherent, logical strategy. Trump just went about it in the worst, most disastrously self-interested way.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, Russia and Iran have invested staggering resources into propping up the Syrian government. Understandably so. With very few allies on the international stage, Russia and Iran\u2019s posture \u2013 which, these days, largely amounts to defending the few friends that they have left \u2013 should hardly be surprising. With this reality in mind, there is strikingly little benefit to further backing Moscow and Tehran into a corner \u2013 or baiting them into conflict \u2013 by keeping U.S. troops in their client state's territory.\n\nContinuing down such a path will all but ensure another round of (in Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi GabbardHillary Clinton has said she'd consider 2020 race if she thought she could win: report Biden, Gabbard suffer hits to favorability after debate The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump's impeachment plea to Republicans MORE and President Trump\u2019s words) \u201cforever wars.\u201d Indeed, increasingly isolated states are far more likely to lash out. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and recent Iranian mischief exemplify this phenomenon. Both cases ultimately led to the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops.\n\nOf course, Russia and Iran do themselves no PR favors by defending Bashar al-Assad, the murderous dictator ruling Syria. But should Assad fall, Syria (and the broader Middle East) would rapidly devolve into yet another jihadist-fueled calamity; except that the collapse of the Assad regime would make the rise of the Islamic State seem like a picnic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoreover, Assad\u2019s Syria is a multi-sectarian state. Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Christians, and Druze live in relative harmony in regime-controlled areas. This stands in stark contrast to the Sunni extremists that Turkey and Saudi Arabia support in northern Syria.\n\nWith these realities in mind, logic dictates that Russia and Iran should continue to expend precious resources propping up their Syrian ally.\n\nDespite endless Washington hand-wringing about a long-term Iranian presence in Syria, Tehran\u2019s mobilization there is a fait accompli. Rather than deterring further Iranian deployments, a small contingent of U.S. troops tucked into a corner of northeastern Syria amounts to an easy target for (thanks to Trump\u2019s disastrous \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign) an increasingly aggressive Iran.\n\nMoreover, despite Iran\u2019s significant footprint in Syria, Damascus and Tehran are uneasy allies. This makes for a shaky inter-state dynamic ripe for future exploitation.\n\nGeopolitical considerations aside, the resurgence of the Islamic State terrorist group continues apace. Had Trump strategically and methodically withdrawn U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, he would have brokered a Syrian-Kurdish truce before removing American forces. A joint Kurdish-Syrian-Russian-Iranian partnership would boast both the operational capability and the motivation to stamp out the last of the Islamic State\u2019s jihadists and keep the lid on any reemergence of the terrorist group.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, U.S. and Western military operations against the Islamic State place the United States and its allies squarely in the Islamic State\u2019s crosshairs. Virtually all recent jihadist attacks in the United States and Europe were couched in the Quranic concept of \u201cdefensive\u201d jihad. This all-important catalyst for jihadist violence leads radicalized individuals to believe that it is their supreme duty to violently \u201cdefend\u201d their coreligionists (perceived as) under attack by non-Muslims anywhere in the world.\n\nThe notion of \u201cdefensive\u201d jihad explains, for example, how a radicalized individual in Florida believed that it was his divine obligation to violently \u201cdefend\u201d his coreligionists in Syria and Iraq by conducting a horrific mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub.\n\nAs such, shifting the burden of finishing off the Islamic State to Iran, Russia and Syria realizes U.S. key counterterrorism goals. With other states taking the reins, would-be jihadists are hard-pressed to rationalize attacks against the United States and its Western allies under the guise of \u201cdefensive\u201d jihad.\n\nA gradual, strategically-executed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria also leaves Russia and Iran to continue expending significant resources propping up their long-time Syrian client. As noted above, this is sound strategy, as the collapse of the Syrian regime would result in yet another catastrophic Middle Eastern power vacuum.\n\nSimilarly, in light of recent Russian and (Trump-induced) Iranian aggression, a contingent of U.S. troops in Syria would be vulnerable to Russo-Persian provocations, exposing the United States to an endless string of \u201cforever wars.\u201d\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.
