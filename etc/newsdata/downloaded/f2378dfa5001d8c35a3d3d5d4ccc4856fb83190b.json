The prime minister said he suspended this Parliament \u2014 filled with vexatious rebels, including within his party \u2014 so he could craft a new Conservative Party legislative agenda full of bold new proposals, such as swelling the ranks of the police force and funding care for the infirm and elderly.\n\nBut many lawmakers weren\u2019t buying it.\n\nJohnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament \u2014 what\u2019s called a prorogation \u2014 is the longest in almost a century. And it is happening in the middle of what is arguably Britain\u2019s worst peacetime crisis since World War II.\n\nEven Johnson\u2019s fellow Tories say the prime minister is playing politics \u2014 and trying to outflank moves to block a general election and stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson said, \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that we will get a deal\u201d at a crucial E.U. summit in late October. \u201cI think we can see the rough area of a landing space, of how you can do it \u2014 it will be tough, it will be hard, but I think we can get there.\u201d\n\nHe said there would still be plenty of time for lawmakers to argue about Brexit when Parliament resumes Oct. 14. British lawmakers and European negotiators are less sure about that.\n\n\u2018The Trumpization of U.K. politics\u2019: Boris Johnson is busting political norms\n\nThe legal wrangling is far from over.\n\nA high court in Northern Ireland on Thursday dismissed the claim that a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of a hard border on the Irish island would wreck the peace process there. The court said the matter was political and not legal. It didn\u2019t consider the question of whether Johnson\u2019s suspension Parliament was unlawful.\n\nOn Tuesday, the British Supreme Court will wrestle with the question of whether Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament can be scrutinized by any judge, following opposing decisions by two of the country\u2019s high courts, in Scotland and England.\n\nIn Brussels, Britain\u2019s top Brexit negotiator, David Frost, has been making very non-newsy, twice-weekly visits for discussions with his European counterparts. But anxious E.U. diplomats say talks actually seem to be moving backward.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s statements about the state of Brexit negotiations bear little relationship to reality, E.U. officials say\n\n\u201cIf solutions are proposed, they will be debated, all of them \u2014 provided they respect the guiding principles of the E.U.,\u201d said European Parliament President David Sassoli. \u201cBut up to now, I can say the U.K. hasn\u2019t proposed any alternatives, anything that\u2019s been legally credible and workable.\u201d\n\nFrost has suggested nothing would meet the E.U. red line that the border remain forever open between the Republic of Ireland, which is staying in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is departing along with the rest of Britain, diplomats said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.\n\nInstead, the diplomats said, Frost has outlined a vision of a Britain that could potentially try to lure businesses by undercutting the European Union in a range of areas, including taxes and regulations. That would require a sharp break from current rules \u2014 making the Europeans ever more adamant about ironclad guarantees for the Irish border.\n\n\u201cWe need a serious partner, not just someone who is screaming slogans, mottos, in the best Trumpian form,\u201d said one of the diplomats. \u201cWe are really nervous because we can\u2019t see what is coming from London. There are no serious discussions.\u201d\n\nFew in Brussels are taking for granted that Johnson will obey the law passed by Parliament that he ask for a delay to the Oct. 31 departure date if he doesn\u2019t strike a deal in the meantime.\n\nInstead, embassies have canceled vacations for their diplomats in late October; emergency preparations for a chaotic, no-deal Brexit have stepped up; and many in the E.U. capital are bracing for what one diplomat called \u201cthe most horrible crisis of recent years.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s remarks came as his government was forced to release a five-page document assessing the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The document \u2014 which was previously leaked and reported on \u2014 predicted there could be days-long delays of trucks moving through British and French ports, electricity prices might spike, some medicines would be in short supply, food prices would rise, and there could be a rise in public disorder.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson also told a group of schoolchildren about his idea of building a bridge across the Irish Sea between Scotland and Northern Ireland. \u201cIt would only cost about \u00a315 billion,\u201d or $18.5 billion, he said.\n\nJohnson suggested the megaproject \u2014 which he has asked government officials to investigate from a feasibility standpoint \u2014 could help ameliorate Brexit woes.\n\n\u201cThere is so much more we can do, and what grieves me about the current approach to Brexit is that we are just in danger of not believing in ourselves, not believing in Britain,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nBirnbaum reported from Brussels.\n\nEuropeans once hoped the British would reverse Brexit. Now, many can\u2019t wait for them to leave.\n\nBoris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess. One of them is to go to jail.\n\nHe defied Boris Johnson. Now the prime minister\u2019s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line.\n\nThe \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 teamed up to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s plans. Can it stay united to steer Brexit?\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "In Britain\u2019s long history, telling false tales to the monarch has often been a bad play.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YEDOH3GLHAI6TJHTYCA2CJW6OA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
