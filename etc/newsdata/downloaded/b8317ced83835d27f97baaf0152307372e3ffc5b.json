They include businesses like Uber and Lyft, payments companies like Visa, Mastercard and Paypal, investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, and nonprofits and academic institutions like Kiva and Women\u2019s World Banking.\n\nIn exchange for investing at least $10 million in the foundation\u2019s reserves (which back the Libra token\u2019s value), these members will get to run validator nodes for the Libra blockchain \u2014 \"a rack of servers that will run transactions,\" as the foundation's currency chief describes it.\n\nThey'll also receive special Libra \"investment tokens,\" which are different from the basic form of the cryptocurrency, and get a vote as part of the foundation\u2019s council.\n\nand get a vote as part of the foundation\u2019s council. For some of these members, Libra may provide a new channel for acquiring customers. \"If you\u2019re Spotify [a founding member], you\u2019re thinking about how there are a lot of people in markets you want to serve that don\u2019t have an ability to pay you digitally,\" Kevin Weil, product chief of Facebook's cryptocurrency division, told Axios.\n\nFacebook\u2019s connection to Libra will be as a member of the governing foundation and as the maker of a digital wallet, called Calibra, for sending and receiving the currency. Calibra will be managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook.\n\nCalibra will initially be available inside Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, WhatsApp, and as standalone iOS and Android apps. Because Libra\u2019s technology is open source, it\u2019s possible new digital wallets could eclipse Facebook\u2019s in popularity someday, Weil told Axios.\n\nThe company \"will make no money off this for a long time,\" he added.\n\nBe smart: This is not Bitcoin. Unlike the pioneering cryptocurrency and many of the other digital-token experiments out there, the goal here is not to supplant the traditional financial system but rather to extend it to serve people without access to conventional banking or stable \"fiat\" (government-created) currency.\n\nIt's also not entirely anonymous . As with Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, although users\u2019 identifying information isn\u2018t directly tied to transactions, their wallet addresses are public and the blockchain's record of transactions can be analyzed to detect patterns and even identify bad actors.\n\n.

Libra\u2019s interaction with fiat currencies around the world will also mean that the digital wallets used to hold the currency will be locally regulated. Facebook\u2019s Calibra division is already in the process of obtaining its own money transmitter licenses in the U.S., for example.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "The company's Libra coin will be backed by an independent foundation and is expected to launch next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/C0tFNRtVyCluTZ_ltiesEQIgZ_g=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/18/1560818106789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-18"}
