Conservative candidates were victorious in 33 of the 34 Alberta ridings.\n\nCandidate Heather McPherson was able to keep Edmonton-Strathcona in NDP hands. The central-Edmonton riding had been represented by NDP MP Linda Duncan for 11 years.\n\nMcPherson told reporters that her campaign took nothing for granted and worked right up \"to the very last hour.\"\n\n\"Holding this seat was really important to us,\" she said. \"It was really important that Alberta, all Albertans, have one progressive candidate representing them in Ottawa, and I'm so delighted I'm that candidate.\"\n\nHeather McPherson kept Edmonton Strathcona in NDP hands, making it the only riding in Alberta that didn't elect a Conservative. (Natasha Riebe/CBC )\n\nSohi, natural resources minister in Justin Trudeau's cabinet, was defeated in Edmonton Mill Woods by Conservative Tim Uppal.\n\nUppal was the MP for Edmonton-Sherwood Park from 2008 to 2015. He ran in Edmonton Mill Woods in 2015 but lost to Sohi by 92 votes.\n\n\"I am so happy and proud to have the support that I got here, and I will represent them in every single way possible that I can,\" Uppal said at his campaign party. \"We want to make sure that Alberta's economy comes back on track, and we'll hold Justin Trudeau to account.\"\n\nIn his concession speech, Sohi said he was proud of the work he did to ensure the federal government did additional consultation with Indigenous communities on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\nHe congratulated Uppal for his victory and consoled his supporters.\n\n\"Yes, we lost the election today, because democracy is something wonderful and we need to accept the results of people because serving in office and being a politician is not a right,\" Sohi said. \"It's a privilege ... that all of us have to continue to work hard to earn.\"\n\nIn Edmonton Centre, Boissonnault lost his bid for a second term to Conservative James Cumming, his closest challenger in the 2015 election.\n\nCumming, the CEO of an Edmonton business development company, said his priority is getting Alberta's economy back on track.\n\n\"We need to get policies that are going to help not only Alberta but the rest of Western Canada,\" he told reporters at his campaign headquarters.\n\n\"We knocked on over 60,000 doors and I'm telling you people told me that they feel that they're they're not getting ahead. We're going to hold [the government's] feet to the fire to make sure that that happens.\"\n\nBoissonnault told his supporters that it was an honour to have represented Edmonton Centre in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Edmonton has my heart and soul and I'm not going anywhere,\" he said to cheers from the crowd. \"The future may look a little different right now, but just as you have been there to support me and us, and our noble cause, know this \u2014 I will be there to support you.\"\n\nLiberal Amarjeet Sohi hugs supporters after losing his Edmonton Mill Woods seat to Tim Uppal of the Conservatives.
