This time, though, Murray was chuckling in the interview room. He was tickled by a moment of slapstick comedy: a front-row fan who leant forward to catch a stray ball, lost his balance, and disappeared out of sight behind the courtside barrier.\n\n\u201cHe must have had a few drinks to go down like that,\u201d Murray grinned. \u201cHis friend obviously found it pretty amusing. It probably wasn\u2019t worth it to catch a tennis ball.\u201d\n\nThe comment was characteristic of Murray\u2019s sunny mood in Antwerp this week, even if he had his grouchy moments on the court. His problem during the match is that he isn\u2019t serving with much fluency, confidence or speed after coming into the European Open with a niggly right elbow that prevented him from practising that shot in the build-up.", "description": "When Andy Murray edged past Romania\u2019s Marius Copil in a tight three-setter last year, he sat on his chair and bawled like a baby at the end of the match \u2013 a symptom of the relentless agony he was feeling from his arthritic right hip.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213320006-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
