His wife, Kendall, stays home with their two boys, Landon and Connor.\n\nExcept for the mortgage on their home in Daytona Beach, Florida, they don't have any other debts, which frees up cash flow to spend on things that they enjoy.\n\nFor Business Insider's \"Real Money\" series, Proctor tracked his family's spending during a typical week. They spent $1,175 on their mortgage, food, and some business expenses.\n\nWant to share a week of your spending? Email yourmoney@businessinsider.com.\n\nMy wife and I have always taken budgeting very seriously. For the first several years of our marriage, we budgeted carefully out of sheer necessity. Out of college, I chose a career in ministry.\n\nAnd that choice put a fairly low ceiling on our household income. We were both OK with that but we also knew that we'd need to find creative ways to save.\n\nSo we followed a strict budget and researched all the savings hacks we could find. And all the work paid off. Even on a limited income, we were able to live quite comfortably. By saving my wife's income during our first few years of marriage, we were able to save up for the down payment on our home in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nAfter our first son was born, my wife decided to stay home with him. So, all of a sudden, we were now down to one income and budgeting became vital once again.\n\nIn June of this year, I launched out as a full-time personal finance freelance writer. For the first time in my life, I don't have a salary and we're dealing with an inconsistent income. So seven years into our marriage, budgeting has once again become a major focus.", "description": "Clint Proctor lives with his wife and sons in Daytona Beach, Florida.
