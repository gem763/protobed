This would allow animals, food and other goods to be traded across the border without customs or health checks.\n\nThe DUP has denounced this as a move to break up the UK, but sources have said they might reconsider if the backstop came with its own backstop \u2013 the so-called \u201cStormont lock\u201d.\n\nThis would allow the assembly to have a veto on the EU rules that would apply when and if the rest of the UK diverged from EU laws. The DUP dismissed the lock at the time as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d because it was not legally binding.\n\nSome, however, believe that governance by Stormont could be part of the solution if it were crowbarred into the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe frustration comes after a week of shuttle diplomacy in which Boris Johnson flew to Dublin for his first face-to-face meeting with Varadkar since he became prime minister.\n\nIn what appeared to be a shift away for his \u201cdo or die\u201d no-deal policy, Johnson said his overwhelming preference was for a deal, claiming it would be a \u201cfailure of statecraft\u201d for all concerned if they were unable to strike a deal.\n\nHis change in tone led many to believe the mood music had changed and space had opened up for a deal centring on the original Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nPhil Hogan, the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner and an ally of Varadkar, said he detected a shift in position offering a glimmer of hope of a deal.\n\n\u201cI also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position \u2026 where he\u2019s now prepared to look at divergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of Ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.\n\nMany believe this could survive only if the backstop were rebranded because it is now considered a toxic term.\n\nHogan told RTE: \u201dThere are constitutional issues that are already in the withdrawal agreement that might have to be improved upon if this is a request that\u2019s made. Of course we can look at it.\u201d", "description": "Coveney says EU concerned at Northern Ireland assembly having veto over single market", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef7e7e28dc214526f22b0702aa5cf93ec1767b7/0_204_3050_1830/master/3050.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6f984589ee68898a398d137bd201d24", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
