The great unknown is whether he will get enough time to piece himself and his team back together again.\n\nIt will not be an easy repair job, that. This one will have stung far more than most because of circumstances that had Everton winning 2-1 on 80 minutes and losing 3-2 at the whistle, via a desperately soft penalty given by the video assistant referee and a stoppage-time own goal.\n\nGut punch doesn't quite cover it. Not when Silva's future was already a matter for debate and is now more uncertain than ever, even if he could point to a performance that deserved more.\n\nEverton left-back Lucas Digne gets his angles all wrong as he diverts the ball into his own goal\n\nSubstitute Glenn Murray celebrates Brighton's stoppage-time winner at the Amex Stadium\n\nBrighton's Neal Maupay converts from the penalty spot to salvage a point for Brighton\n\nMichael Keane accidentally stepped on Aaron Connolly's foot, and VAR intervened\n\nThe penalty was awarded by Video Assistant Referee Lee Mason to the delight of home fans\n\nMATCH FACTS AND LEAGUE TABLE BRIGHTON (4-4-2): Ryan 6.5; Montoya 5.5 (Schelotto 66, 6), Webster 6, Dunk 6, Burn 7.5; Gross 7 (Trossard 65, 7), Stephens 6, Propper 6, Alzate 6; Connolly 6.5 (Murray 80), Maupay 7 Subs not used: Button, Bissouma, Balogun, March Booked: Stephens, Propper Goalscorers: Gros 15, Maupay pen 80, Digne 90+4 Manager: Graham Potter 7 EVERTON (4-2-3-1): Pickford 5; Sidibe 6, Keane 6.5, Holgate 7, Digne 6; Davies 6.5, Gomes 5.5; Walcott 6.5 (Delph 72, 6.5), Bernard 6 (Sigurdsson 29), Iwobi 6 (Calvert-Lewin 72, 7); Richarlison 7 Subs not used: Lossl, Coleman, Schneiderlin, Kean Goalscorers: Webster og 20, Calvert-Lewin 74 Booked: Holgate Manager: Marco Silva 6.5 Referee: Andy Madley 5 Attendance: 30,529 Season at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nSadly for Everton and managers of any club, what you deserve usually counts for diddly squat when set against the cold currency of points.\n\nAnd on that front, after a fifth defeat in six games, Everton and Silva have precious little in hand. They are two points above the bottom three and really, that is all. Nothing else matters so much.\n\nHas VAR now set the bar at \u2018limbo levels\u2019? VAR has been accused of finally lowering its high bar for intervention after the technology overturned its first penalty decision in Brighton\u2019s 3-2 win over Everton. Referee Andy Madley originally waved play on when Aaron Connolly went down under Michael Keane\u2019s challenge \u2014 only for VAR to award a penalty on review. Gary Lineker tweeted: \u2018VAR hasn\u2019t given a penalty this season, finally gives one to Brighton for next to nothing. The bar that has been at pole vault heights has descended to limbo dancing levels.\u2019 However, Mail on Sunday referee expert Chris Foy said VAR made the right call: \u2018It is a clear penalty. It may not be intentional but that does not matter as intent is not in the laws.\u2019\n\nThey can talk about recent progress, about Brighton having only one shot on goal until their 80th-minute equaliser from the spot. They can talk about the weird VAR decision that made said equaliser, with Michael Keane penalised retrospectively for stepping on Aaron Connolly's ankle while they jostled for a high ball.\n\nThey can talk about their own shout for a penalty that wasn't given when Richarlison and Martin Montoya came together early in the second half and they can talk about scoring two goals in an away game for the first time this season. They can talk about those things and they did talk about those things.\n\nAnd it changes nothing. The only meaningful facts are that they trailed to a Pascal Gross free-kick, led through the combination of an Adam Webster own goal and a Dominic Calvert-Lewin finish, and then were trodden deep into the muck by Neal Maupay's penalty and Lucas Digne's 94th-minute own goal. Brutal.\n\nSilva put a dignified face on it and summed it all up with one particular comment, saying: 'It's difficult for us to understand how some things happened this afternoon. We have to keep working even if there are some things you can't understand.\n\nTwo minutes after coming on, Dominic Calvert-Lewin struck home past goalkeeper Matt Ryan\n\nPascal Gross had earlier put Brighton in front with a right-footed free-kick into the top corner\n\n'We were in control at that moment (of the penalty awarded by the VAR) and that moment completely changed the game. We should have controlled the game differently but that decision and why that decision happened was very difficult for us to understand.\n\n'We should have had a clear penalty after 50 minutes (when Richarlison was challenged by Montoya).'\n\nA clear penalty is pushing it, perhaps. But his grievance with the decision against Keane \u2013 spotted remotely by Lee Mason and fed to Andy Madley on the field - was understandable. Less so, is how Everton find themselves here.\n\nStep back from the minutiae of the matches and you see a club that spent \u00a3100m in the summer and has still lost to Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Sheffield United, Burnley and now Brighton. An over-simplification, possibly, but this is certainly not the grand vision that the club saw following Sam Allardyce's departure 17 months ago.\n\nGross (centre) celebrates his 15th-minute strike, though the lead only lasted for five minutes\n\nRicharlison thought he equalised for Everton but the ball actually went in off Adam Webster\n\nFor Brighton, the win took them up to 12th, level on points with Tottenham, albeit after one more game. Graham Potter is doing well there, even if he was sensible enough to admit this win came against the grain.\n\n'I think we've played better this season and not got anything,' he said. 'Maybe we had a bit of luck, but those who have watched us will probably say we've earnt a bit of luck. I'm delighted for the guys.\n\n'I feel for Everton because they put a lot into the game. Did they deserve to lose? No, but that's football.'\n\nBrighton's main moment of quality came with Gross's opener from a free-kick, which came after Andre Gomes fouled Aaron Connolly.\n\nFrom 20 yards Gross fizzed his shot past Jordan Pickford, but once more, you had to wonder about the England goalkeeper, who was beaten on his side of the wall by a shot closer to the middle of the goal than the top corner.\n\nRicharlison celebrates Everton's equaliser, though the goal was later taken away from him\n\nBrighton's Neal Maupay tussles for the ball with Everton's Michael Keane and Djibril Sidibe\n\nHis form has been awfully unpredictable for much of the year.\n\nLucas Digne made the equaliser with an inswinging corner that Richarlison headed in via the side of Webster's head \u2013 it was given as an own goal \u2013 before Calvert-Lewin scored an excellent second within two minutes of coming on.\n\nHe has five goals in his past five games in all competitions and with it, Everton were in sight of a first away win since March.\n\nAlas, so close. Instead, they conceded that questionable penalty and then saw a disappointing draw become a devastating loss when Digne diverted a low cross from Leandro Trossard past his own keeper.", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI AT THE AMEX STADIUM: Soaked through and staring into space, Marco Silva looked a broken man by the end.
