Here's everything we know about the candidate and how she stacks up against the competition.", "language": "en", "text": "Who is Tulsi Gabbard?\n\nCurrent job: US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district. Major in the Hawaii Army National Guard. Running for president of the United States as a Democratic candidate.\n\nAge: 38\n\nFamily: Gabbard is married to freelance cinematographer Abraham Williams.\n\nHometown: Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nPrevious jobs: Hawaii House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004. Senate legislative aide from 2007 to 2009. Honolulu City Council from 2011 to 2012.\n\nWho is Tulsi Gabbard's direct competition for the nomination?\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Tulsi Gabbard's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is a frontrunner in the election and remains so \u2014 though a weaker one \u2014 among those satisfied with Gabbard.\n\nOf those respondents who had heard of Gabbard, less than 20 percent would be satisfied with her as nominee, while over a third would be unsatisfied. Those are rough numbers for Gabbard. That also means our sample size of who her supporters like is fairly slim.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren outperform among Gabbard supporters and are ideologically nearest to her. Those satisfied with Gabbard as the nominee were also disproportionately likely to be satisfied with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. However, with sample sizes like this it's not great read too deeply into that.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nWhat are Tulsi Gabbard's political positions?\n\nWhat are Tulsi Gabbard's political successes?\n\nGabbard is one of the first two female combat veterans to serve in Congress and is its first ever Hindu member.\n\nShe was elected to the Hawaii State House to represent West Oahu at the age of 21, which made her the youngest woman ever elected to the state legislature.\n\nIn 2013 Gabbard was elected vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nHow much money has Tulsi Gabbard raised?\n\nGabbard raised $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and reported raising roughly $5.6 million overall. Her campaign hasn't yet released third-quarter fundraising figures yet.\n\nHow is Tulsi Gabbard viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nInsider has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Gabbard was generally considered to be one of the more centrist candidates in the field. Gabbard was among the less experienced candidates int the field when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Gabbard emerged towards the bottom of the pack, possibly due to her low profile.\n\nCould Tulsi Gabbard beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to Insider's recurring poll, Tulsi Gabbard overall is believed to be a weaker candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to the whole field.\n\nIt's very early and Gabbard has not had time to make an impact among the vast majority of voters, and of the Democrats who knew of her and weighed in the number who thought she would lose is three times larger than the number who though she would win. In politics this is considered a bad performance.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Tulsi Gabbard's qualifications?\n\nInsider has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include her position in the House of Representatives (+30%), that she is age 50 or younger (+23%), and an armed forces veteran (+17%).\n\nAn attribute considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters is that she grew up wealthy (-42%).\n\nRead more of our best stories on Tulsi Gabbard:", "description": "Gabbard is one of the\u00a0first two female combat veterans\u00a0to serve in Congress and is its first-ever Hindu member.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5e8b6cc4a0a5a5e4e90c3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
