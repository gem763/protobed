And that's the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won't provide access to what's called a public interest defence.\u201d\n\nMr Snowden has long described himself as a whistle-blower who leaked secret information about the NSA spying on the American public, before fleeing the country by travelling through Hong Kong to Russia, where he has been living under asylum.", "description": "The United States has\u00a0filed a lawsuit against Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor and Central Intelligence Agency employee who in 2013 leaked documents about US surveillance, saying his new memoir violates non-disclosure agreements.
