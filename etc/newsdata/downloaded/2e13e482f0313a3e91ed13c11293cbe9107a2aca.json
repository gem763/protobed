RPT-Asia Rice-African demand boosts Vietnam rates, India prices dip to 4-month low\n\n(Repeats Thursday's story with no changes to text)\n\n* Thai prices narrow to $396-$400 a tonne from $396-$417\n\n* India's exports in August fall 29% y/y\n\n* Bangladesh reports bumper harvest\n\n\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nBENGALURU, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Vietnamese rice export prices\n\nrose to their highest in two months this week as demand from\n\nAfrican buyers increased, while prices in top exporter India\n\nfell to a four-month low on sluggish demand.\n\nRates for 5% broken rice RI-VNBKN5-P1 in Vietnam rose to\n\n$350 a tonne, matching early August's peak, from $330-$340 a\n\ntonne a week ago.\n\n\"Demand seems to be recovering now with more vessels waiting\n\nto be loaded at Ho Chi Minh City ports,\" a trader based in the\n\nMekong Delta province of An Giang said.\n\nPreliminary data showed at least 70,600 tonnes of rice are\n\nscheduled for loading at Ho Chi Minh City ports during October\n\n1-20, with most bound for West Africa and Malaysia, traders\n\nsaid.\n\nAfrica's demand for Vietnamese jasmine rice has increased\n\nsignificantly recently, a Ho Chi Minh City-based trader said.\n\nCustoms data released on Thursday showed September rice\n\nshipments from Vietnam fell 20.4% from August to 479,363 tonnes.\n\nHowever, shipments in the January-September period rose 3.7%\n\nfrom a year earlier to 5.06 million tonnes.\n\nIn contrast, softer demand from African countries for\n\nIndia's 5 percent broken parboiled variety RI-INBKN5-P1 saw\n\nprices extend losses to touch their lowest level in nearly\n\nfour-months at $368-$372 per tonne from $369-$373 a week ago.\n\n\"African countries have ample inventories. They are not\n\nactive in the (Indian) market now,\" said an exporter based at\n\nKakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIndia's rice exports in August fell 29% year-on-year to\n\n644,249 tonnes, government data showed. Weak demand also weighed on the Thai market, with benchmark\n\n5-percent broken rice RI-THBKN5-P1 prices narrowing to\n\n$396-$400 a tonne from $396-$417 last week.\n\n\"It doesn't look like there will be fresh demand for Thai\n\nrice in the short term, even well into next month,\" a\n\nBangkok-based trader said.\n\nThe baht THB=TH , Asia's best performing currency this\n\nyear, has been one of the main factors keeping prices of the\n\nThai variety higher than competitors.\n\n\"The market is expecting new supply after the end of the\n\nrainy season this month,\" another Bangkok-based trader said.\n\nElsewhere, Bangladesh's rice output from the summer crop\n\nalso known as 'Boro', hit a record 20.4 million tonnes,\n\nexceeding a target of 19.5 million tonnes, on higher acreage,\n\nsaid Mizanur Rahman, a senior official of the Department of\n\nAgriculture Extension.\n\nHowever, the bumper harvest failed to cheer farmers who have\n\nincurred huge losses this year from high production costs and\n\nlow domestic prices.\n\nBoro usually contributes more than half of Bangladesh's\n\ntypical annual rice production of around 35 million tonnes.\n\n\n\n", "description": "RPT-Asia Rice-African demand boosts Vietnam rates, India prices dip to 4-month low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6F0F8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
