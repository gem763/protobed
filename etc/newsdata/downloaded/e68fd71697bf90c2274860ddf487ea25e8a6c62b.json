Developments on the U.S.-Japan trade front were in focus after reports suggested that the negotiations might have hit a last-minute snag.\n\nCiting people familiar with the talks, Reuters reported that the two nations are still hoping to sign a trade deal this week.\n\nHowever, the deal might be \u201climited\u201d and is not expected to include changes to tariffs governing autos, the biggest source of the $67.6 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan, Reuters said.\n\nOn the data front, Japan\u2019s Jibun Bank Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index slipped to a seasonally adjusted 48.9 from a final 49.3 in the previous month, marking the quickest pace of deterioration since February.\n\nThe pair was little changed at 107.53 by 11:45 PM ET (03:45 GMT).\n\nThe pair was also near flat at 1.0988. Manufacturing activity in Germany fell to its lowest level since the financial crisis this month, data from IHS Markit showed. Germany\u2019s services sector also grew at its slowest pace in nine months.\n\nThe pair was also largely unchanged. The People\u2019s Bank of China said on Tuesday that Beijing has many monetary policy tools and large policy room to support its economy.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement that the country\u2019s financial risks are generally under control and that the current interest rate levels are appropriate.\n\nIncoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the Sino-U.S. trade war is weighing like a \u201cbig, dark cloud\u201d on global economy.\n\n\u201cThe longer this lingers, the more uncertainty sinks in. And if you\u2019re an investor, if you\u2019re an enterprise, whether small, medium size or big, you\u2019re not going to invest, you\u2019re going to wait. You\u2019re going to sit and wonder where the supply chains are going to be organized,\u201d Lagarde said in an interview CNBC.\n\nConcerns that the tension between China and the U.S. might have escalated once again intensified over the weekend after the U.S. requested China to cancel a planned visit to U.S. farming regions over the weekend.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later explained that the timing of the trip \u201cwasn\u2019t necessarily the perfect timing\u201d but China have commited to buy more farm products and that \u201cthey\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nThe pair and the pair both gained 0.1%.", "description": "Forex - Yen Near Flat; U.S.-Japan Trade Talks Hit Last-Minute Snag", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC3L0Q0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
