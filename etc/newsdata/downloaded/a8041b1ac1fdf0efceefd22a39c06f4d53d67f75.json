One of his neighbors, a female either his age or younger that he did not know the name of, has lived across the hall from him for the last two years.\n\n'We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors,' he wrote.\n\nHis post went on to explain how he doesn't know how to cook and no longer can afford takeout due to losing one of his jobs.\n\n'I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great,' he wrote.\n\nI think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway\n\nThe combination of poor diet and inability to make food on his own apparently encouraged the Redditor to then ask his neighbor across the hall to make him dinner for pay every night.\n\nHe believed this suggestion was acceptable because she was already making dinner for herself each night, which he could smell from across the hall.\n\n'She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food,' the man wrote.\n\nWhen he approached the neighbor about his suggestion, she told him it was 'rude' for him to ask and refused to make him dinner.\n\n'I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay),' he wrote.\n\n'The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want.'\n\nFeed yourself! The man asked people online if he was in the wrong, and most people said he was 'creepy' and 'sexist' for his post\n\nMortified: Most commenters thought the man was at fault for thinking he could ask a stranger to cook for him\n\nFrustrated: The Reddit post went viral after multiple people shared it online\n\nProblematic: One person pointed out how the man was mad his neighbor called him a stranger, but he doesn't know her name\n\nPoor form: Another Twitter users revealed how the man commented saying he just wanted to 'get a girlfriend who will cook for him'\n\nThe woman also called the man a 'stranger', which insulted him. But he also confessed to not even knowing her name.\n\n'I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more,' he wrote.\n\nBut commenters were quick to slam the man for having the audacity to think that a random woman should cook for him just so he doesn't have to learn how to cook himself.\n\nMost people stated it was not on his female neighbor to make sure he got fed, whether she was making food or not.\n\n'You are a jerk, you were being creepy, and you should be way more embarrassed than you are,' one upset commenter wrote. 'Stop harassing your neighbor, learn to cook, and leave her the f**k alone.'\n\nAnother person wrote: 'For one, you\u2019re assuming a lot. You\u2019re assuming this woman has nothing better to do than to plan a menu, shop, cook and serve you for a few extra dollars? Enjoying cooking for oneself does not mean she wants to turn it into a business. Watch some YouTube videos on easy one meals, learn to feed yourself.'\n\nThe Reddit post was so controversial that it was even shared on Twitter after people were disgusted by the man's request. This sparked people to inquire why the man wouldn't just learn to cook for himself.\n\n'For everyone in my mentions asking why he doesn't learn to cook, he says in the comments that his plan is to work more and get a girlfriend who will cook for him,' the Twitter users wrote. 'So that should tell you everything you need to know.'\n\nPeople also called the man 'sexist' and 'creepy' for his suggestion.\n\nAfter receiving an plethora of comments explaining why his suggestion was wrong, the man finally conceded he made the wrong decision.\n\n'It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy,' he wrote. 'My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair.'", "description": "One Redditor shared how he asked his female neighbor to cook dinner for him.
