Nine of the leaders, including the former vice president of the Catalan government, were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison for sedition. Four of them also were charged with misuse of public funds.\n\nYet while many Catalans are outraged at the central government in Madrid for the harsh crackdown on the independence movement, the huge demonstrations have obscured deep divisions in Catalan society.\n\nIn an official survey in July, more than 48% of respondents said they did not want Catalonia to become an independent state, compared with 44% in favor.\n\nJust a 20-minute metro ride from the unrest downtown in Catalonia's capital city of Barcelona, the working-class neighborhood of Nou Barris has a somewhat different mood. It has hardly any pro-independence flags hanging from balconies and few of its residents are seen wearing the yellow ribbon supporters of the jailed leaders have pinned to their clothes.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Luc\u00eda Benavides for NPR Luc\u00eda Benavides for NPR\n\n\"Catalonia belongs to Spain,\" says Sara P\u00e9rez, 62, sitting on a park bench in Nou Barris, waiting for her grandson to get out of boxing class. \"I consider myself Catalan, although the way things are going, each day a little less.\"\n\nShe says her neighborhood is full of people who agree with her, even though she tries to avoid the thorny subject of Catalan independence. You never know how people might react, she says.\n\n\"I've heard of families who have always gotten along but are now arguing over this,\" P\u00e9rez says. \"Some are in favor, others against it, and there's conflict.\"\n\nCritics of the independence drive often point to Spain's 1978 constitution, which says Spain is \"indivisible\" but it gives Catalonia some administrative and legal powers as an \"autonomous community.\"\n\nFlanked by the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees mountains, Catalonia has a population of about 7.5 million, the second largest in Spain, and a distinct language and cultural heritage. It contributes about a fifth of Spain's gross domestic product, the biggest share. Its leaders have long sought greater autonomy for the community.\n\nIn October 2017, Catalonia held a referendum on whether to become an independent republic, but Spain banned it and deployed national police to prevent voting. Forty-three percent of voters turned up and chose independence by 90%. The Catalan parliament voted to declare independence.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Emilio Morenatti/AP Emilio Morenatti/AP\n\nThese momentous events were a painful chapter for many Spaniards who reject Catalonia's claim to sovereign statehood, but also for the many Catalans who watched Spanish authorities aggressively block voters, arrest the referendum organizers and ultimately take full control of the regional government.\n\nCatalan President Carles Puigdemont and several others fled to Belgium to avoid arrest. Puigdemont faces possible extradition proceedings after Spain issued a European arrest warrant for him this week.\n\nIn May 2018, Catalans elected hard-line secessionist Quim Torra as their new president.\n\nThis week, Torra is defiant following Monday's verdict: He is pushing for another independence referendum.\n\n\"If they convict us to 100 years for going to the polls for self-determination, then the response is clear: Self-determination should be put back on the ballot,\" he said to Catalan parliament on Thursday.\n\nMuch of Catalonia is critical of both the Spanish and Catalan governments. Lola Garc\u00eda, a 49-year-old taking an afternoon stroll with her daughter in Nou Barris, on the outskirts of Barcelona, says both sides are in desperate need of dialogue with each other, but neither is taking the first step.\n\n\"If the independence referendum would have been organized better, if they would have negotiated something with Madrid, I would have participated,\" says Garc\u00eda, who doesn't support the independence movement. \"We have the right to demand a vote on independence.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sandra Montanez/Getty Images Sandra Montanez/Getty Images\n\nAccording to a poll in September, around 70% of respondents in Catalonia favored holding a referendum, as long as it's carried out legally.\n\nSohail Jannessari, political science researcher at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University, says rather than engaging in dialogue, Spain has historically suppressed independence movements \u2014 and that has made the movement's supporters angrier.\n\n\"In essence, the whole process of the Catalan independence movement has been a massive mobilization to do civil disobedience against the Spanish state,\" says Jannessari.\n\nThis week, many protesters were triggered by what they view as harsh sentences. For example, two of those convicted, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, the heads of grassroots groups that organized pro-independence protests, were sentenced to nine years in prison for sedition.\n\n\"It's a very outdated crime to happen in a Western democracy in the 21st century,\" Jannessari says. \"Based on the interpretation of the Spanish law, yes, it's illegal to hold a referendum on independence of a region. But they could've used other offenses to convict them.\"", "description": "While many Catalans are outraged at the central government's crackdown on the independence movement, the huge demonstrations have obscured deep divisions in Catalan society.", "authors": ["Luc\u00eda Benavides"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/18/gettyimages-1181902716_wide-a93d85817283cc1cf4afbbdd8cbcb6d2797b43f2.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
