And he's looking to continue that form in Moscow.\n\nThe 23-year-old Muscovite thrashed fellow rising star Alexander Zevrev 6-4, 6-1 on Sunday to clinch the Shanghai Masters in China and continue his assault on the big tennis top three of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.\n\nMedevev\u2019s Shanghai win on Sunday was his third title in six straight finals, having previously won the Masters 1000-level tournament in Cincinnati and the St. Petersburg trophy. He has also picked up more points in the last three months than any other player on the tour.\n\nHis victory in China means Medvedev's pursuit may not be far off from becoming reality. He is on course to finish the year ahead of all-time great Federer and moved ahead of the Swiss in the ATP Race To London after picking up 400 points for his final victory.\n\nI have a childish coach \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/5ms2erB1tT \u2014 Daniil Medvedev (@DaniilMedwed) October 13, 2019\n\nAt the Kremlin Cup, Medvedev received a first round bye to set up a second round match up with the winner of Russian pairing Alibek Kachmazov and Alen Avidzba. Medvedev\u2019s compatriot and 2nd seed Karen Khachanov will play either Germany\u2019s Philipp Kohlschreiber or Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert.\n\nCroatia\u2019s Marin Cilic and Serbia\u2019s Dusan Lajovic are the only other men\u2019s players to receive byes as the third and fourth seeds respectively.\n\nRussians crash out at qualifiers\n\nQualifying for the tournament got underway on Saturday where Russian players didn't fare too well. There was a shock for women\u2019s singles second seed Vitalia Diatchenko, who was battered in straight sets 6-1, 6-2 to Bulgarian world number 170 Isabella Shinikova.\n\nDiatchenko made headlines by virtue of her \u2018cartoon superhero\u2019 arms noted by fans when she went up against US great Serena Williams in the French Open 1st round this year, but didn\u2019t get the chance to create any more press drama as she crashed out in surprising fashion.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Arms like a cartoon superhero!' Serena opponent Diatchenko's bulging biceps cause stir Down Under\n\nValentina Ivakhnenko was beaten 3-6, 6-4, 36 after a staging something of a fightback in the second set against Ukrainian Anhelina Kalinina, while 17-year-old rookie Elina Zakharova was unlucky in winning her first qualifier against vastly more experienced Nadiia Kichenok but then losing on the second day to Slovakia\u2019s Jana \u010cepelov\u00e1.\n\nVlada Koval was soundly beaten 6-0, 6-0 by Estonia\u2019s six-time Grand Slam quarter finalist and former world no. 15 Kaia Kanepi and Varvara Flink lost an entertaining match to Canadian Gabriela Dabrowski.\n\nElsewhere, there was also bad news for 19-year-old Moscow native Sofya Lansere who was sent out in her home tournament by fellow teen star Olga Danilovic from Serbia.\n\nThe luck of the draw meant two all-Russian qualifiers Polina Kudermetova sent out Oksana Selekhmeteva and Ludmilla Samsonova vanquished Kamilla Rakhimova, but the victors of both those ties lost in their subsequent next round qualifiers.\n\nIn the men\u2019s singles, Artem Dubrivnyy was the only home player to make it out of qualifying, with an impressive win over Belarusian third seed Ilya Ivashka with a spirited come-from-behind win 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 before bettering Filip Horansky from Slovakia on the tournament\u2019s second day.\n\nRoman Safiullin lost in straight sets to Czech Lukas Rosol 6-3, 6-4, his fellow countryman Evgeny Karlovskiy 6-4, 3-6, 0-6 to Horansky and Alexey Vatutin lost 6-4 63 to Bosnian Damir Dzumhur, who then went on to qualify for the tournament proper with victory over Sebastian Ofner.\n\nThe pick of the action for Monday\u2019s ties sees two-time Grand Slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova take on Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1. Kanepi will play Tereza Martincov\u00e1 and 18-year-old Anastasia Potapova go up against Anna Kalinskaya. In the men\u2019s singles, Chilean fifth seed Cristian Garin will play Andreas Seppi.", "description": "The 2019 Kremlin Cup will mark the  30th edition of Moscow\u2019s showcase tennis event with Daniil Medvedev expected to light up the ATP Tour 250 event in the Russian capital, which doubles as a homecoming for the tennis 'bad boy'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da362ef85f5401bb20dc140.JPG", "published_at": "2016-02-22"}
