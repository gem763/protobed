A 2-milligram dose is lethal.\n\nWhen it\u2019s smuggled into the U.S. through the mail or courier, it\u2019s usually very pure and is relatively easy to detect from a sample. That product is usually then processed and cut in purity for street sale.\n\nBut the fentanyl smuggled across the southwest border is usually already street-ready, at less than 10% purity.\n\nThe problem is CBP bought detectors without properly testing them \u2014 and it turns out they can\u2019t always detect fentanyl of purity less than 10%, the audit said. One unit had a success rate of just 50%.\n\nEven after a warning, CBP went ahead and bought more of those detectors. In 2016 and 2017 it spent $8.1 million on 94 screening devices that struggle to detect low-level purity, then spent another $17.5 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 on 185 more devices, the audit found.\n\nInvestigators made four recommendations about improving detection. CBP agreed with all four.\n\nThe agency said it\u2019s working with the manufacturer \u201cto increase the functionality of the devices currently deployed.\u201d\n\nThe agency also belatedly issued procedures for use of the handheld detectors.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
