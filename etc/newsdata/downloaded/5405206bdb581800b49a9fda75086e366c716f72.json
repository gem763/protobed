I came in hoping to have around 21 metres and close to a personal best and I would have been super happy.\"\n\nNedow, whose 21.18 PB came in April at Long Beach, Calif., qualified for Saturday's final on his third and final attempt in the qualification round with a throw of 20.94.\n\nIt was a 1-2 American finish, with Joe Kovacs capturing gold with a throw of 22.90 to set a championship record.
