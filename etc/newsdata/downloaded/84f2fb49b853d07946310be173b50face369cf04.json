Some 38 voted directly against holding a general election last night.\n\nAnd a string of prominent Tories were also furious at Boris Johnson's decision to push ahead with an election instead of trying to pass his Brexit deal in Parliament.\n\nHeidi Allen, who was elected in 2017 as a Conservative MP before leading the ill-fated Change UK and defecting to the Liberal Democrats, has confirmed she will not stand again .\n\nFollow the latest updates below.", "description": "It comes as MPs prep for a showdown vote on a bill to call the contest - after blocking it three times", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Dan Bloom", "Oliver Milne"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749586.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_election-mainED.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
