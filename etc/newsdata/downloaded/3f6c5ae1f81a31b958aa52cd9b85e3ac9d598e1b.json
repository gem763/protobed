How could I love this baby the way I loved Emmy? Was it okay to love this baby the way I loved Emmy? It felt like by loving my son, I was trying to replace her.\n\n'The fear of birthing my son and what that meant .....a monumental step forward....proof that time continued without her when all I wanted was for time to stop. But let me say this....I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\n'Easton provided us an even closer bond to his sister. The moment I heard his cry, something sparked back alive in my soul. Hope. Love. I\u2019m not sure.\n\n'But in that moment, I knew I was Mom and my kids deserved the world from me. Everything was going to be okay. My joy and grief could coexist. Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys.'\n\nBode and Morgan have three sons, six-year-old Samuel, four-year-old Nash, and 10-month-old Easton, and a daughter Neesyn, 11, from Bode's previous relationship.\n\nThe couple was attending a neighbor's party last June when their daughter, who was just 19 months old at the time, ended up in the pool.\n\nEmeline was rescued from the water but paramedics were unable to revive her, and she later died in hospital.\n\nSince losing her daughter, Morgan has become an advocate for water safety, regularly opening up about the tragic loss in an effort to prevent similar accidents happening for others.", "description": "The former Olympic ski racer's wife Morgan Beck, 32, shared the picture of her growing baby bump on Instagram Wednesday evening.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19841176-0-image-a-2_1571321460964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
