It sets out that parliament\u2019s lower house will fast-track the legislation and finish its consideration later on Tuesday. It must then pass onto parliament\u2019s upper chamber for further consideration.\n\nThe timetable motion was amended before it passed. The amendment means that lawmakers can propose changes to the bill later in the day.", "description": "British lawmakers approved on Tuesday the government's timetable for passing a law which calls for an early general election on Dec. 12.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446202249&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S15O", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
