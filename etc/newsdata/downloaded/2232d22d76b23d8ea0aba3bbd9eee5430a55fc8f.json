I\u2019m going to get on and do it,\u201d he told BBC television.\n\nAsked if he would resign to avoid having to ask for a delay, Johnson said: \u201cNo, I have undertaken to lead the party and my country at a difficult time and I am going to continue to do that. I believe it is my responsibility.\u201d\n\nMichael Gove, the minister in charge of planning for a so-called no-deal Brexit, was equally confident the government\u2019s plans would not be derailed, saying ministers knew the shape of the deal they wanted to pursue ahead of an Oct. 17/18 EU summit.\n\n\u201cWe know broadly what the outline of a deal might look like. If we can secure progress on all sides then we can get a deal agreed before the October (EU) council and we can have it signed off at the October council,\u201d Gove told an event at the conference.\n\nBut opposition lawmakers are increasingly hostile to Johnson\u2019s government, accusing the prime minister of stoking division by using terms such as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d. Even those who want a deal, might not be as compliant as before.\n\nELECTION FEVER\n\nThe Conservatives, like the main opposition Labour Party, are gearing up for an early election to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nNo election is scheduled until 2022, but a snap poll is now widely expected to take place before the end of the year, especially after Johnson\u2019s Conservatives lost their majority in parliament.\n\nPolling firm Opinium said the main opposition Labour Party gained 2 percentage points after its conference in Brighton last week, but the Conservatives still held a 12-point lead.\n\nMatt Hancock, health minister, used the start of the Conservative conference to announce billions of pounds in spending for hospital projects across England - part of a plan by the ruling party to make good on some of the pledges made during the referendum campaign which Johnson helped lead.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen outside the venue for the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, September 29, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nLabour also used its conference to launch new policies, including plans for a four-day working week, but has yet to back Johnson\u2019s calls for an election, fearful he will lead Britain out of the EU without an agreement before any such poll is held.\n\nThough the option of bringing a vote of no confidence in Johnson has been mooted in some quarters, Labour\u2019s education policy chief Angela Rayner said on Sunday the party wanted to \u201cget no deal off the table\u201d before it did anything else.\n\nBut time is running out on efforts to avoid a potentially chaotic departure from the EU, which many businesses say could hurt the economy and tip the country into recession.\n\nThe government is expected this week to present proposals aimed at overcoming the main stumbling block in talks - the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. So far the two sides have failed to agree how to prevent the return to a hard border if any future UK/EU deal fails to maintain frictionless trade.\n\nArlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is allied with the Conservatives, again set out her red lines on any Brexit deal, telling an event at the Manchester gathering that the province could not be treated differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe DUP is seen as key to securing any Brexit deal.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons lower house of parliament and an ally of Johnson, said he believed both Conservative and opposition lawmakers would most probably vote for any Brexit deal supported by the DUP.\n\nJohnson said he was still hopeful of securing a \u201cgood deal\u201d with the EU but added he would not pretend it would be easy.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cIt is certainly true that other EU countries also don\u2019t want this thing to keep dragging on, and they don\u2019t want the UK to remain in the EU truculent and mutinous and in a limbo and not wishing to cooperate in the way they would like,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong view across the EU that it is time to move on.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson said on Sunday he would not quit as Britain's prime minister even if he fails to secure a deal to leave the European Union, insisting only his Conservative government can deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435253358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0P4", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
