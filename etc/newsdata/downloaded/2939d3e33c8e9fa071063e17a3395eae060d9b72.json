That\u2019s how he is.\n\n\u2018But if you want to go in new ways, and I wanted a new path at BVB at this point, then I at least had to ask Jurgen to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would not have forgiven myself for not asking him at that moment.\u2019\n\nWith Klopp still in charge of Liverpool, leading them to the Champions League title in June and currently sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League, we know how the story ends.\n\nIt is also no surprise that the 52-year-old gave the suggestion pretty short shrift, with his contract at Anfield running until 2023.\n\n\u2018My phone rang while I was on the plane Aki was on it: \u201cJ\u00fcrgen, you have to come back.\u201d I thought he was kidding,\u2019 said Klopp of the surprise call from Watzke (known as Aki).\n\n\u2018Are you stupid? Have you been drinking? How did you get the idea? I\u2019ve got a few more years in Liverpool.\u2019\n\nKlopp has not ruled out a return to Dortmund at some point in his career, although he admits that it does not seem a probable step.\n\n\u2018As a rescuer in need, if the club really needs my help \u2013 why should not I do that?\u2019 said Klopp. \u2018It\u2019s very nice that I even have the opportunity. But, I admit, it does not seem so likely.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s always something new to come.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jamie Carragher reveals what could cost Liverpool the Premier League title\n\nMORE: Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold welcomes Kevin de Bruyne comparison and eyes midfield role", "description": "Borussia Dortmund made a bold attempt to bring Jurgen Klopp back to the club from Liverpool last year, but the move never got off the ground.
