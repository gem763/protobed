Everlane has now partnered with a mill in Italy to help change that. The brand is recycling cashmere sweaters and blending the recycled material with extra-fine merino wool to create a brand new, super soft sweater.\n\nThe ReCashmere comes in three women\u2019s styles (vintage crew, varsity cardigan, and button crop) and two men\u2019s styles (crew and v-neck). The sweaters are priced starting at $98 and go up to $120, the sweet spot for a sweater you want to invest in and get years of wear out of. They\u2019re vintage-inspired without feeling stuffy or trendy. You can pair them with practically any fall outfit you can think of. I\u2019m eyeing the Button Crop to pair with black jeans and ankle boots under my leather jacket.\n\nEverlane is at the forefront of sustainable, recycled fabrics. The ReCashmere line means you can feel good about wearing a sweater that helped cut down its carbon footprint by 50%. That\u2019s something you\u2019ll enjoy snuggling up to in the fall. | Shop at Everlane >\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
