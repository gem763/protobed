The national security implications of the president pressuring an embattled ally for political help threw open the door for more moderate Democrats \u2014 many of them products of the military and intelligence communities, rather than lifelong politicians \u2014 to justify their decision to pursue an impeachment case against the president despite his relative popularity in their districts. In Tuesday\u2019s outpouring of new demands for an inquiry, national security loomed large as a rationale\u2026\n\nAmong the main questions for Democrats is how unified they are now on an issue that has created deep rifts within their ranks until this week. It is far from clear, for instance, whether they agree on how broad the impeachment inquiry should be, or who should run it.
