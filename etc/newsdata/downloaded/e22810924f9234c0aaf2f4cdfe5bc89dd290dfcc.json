Jason Scott\n\nPeter Zalewski was the air-traffic controller at the Boston Center in New Hampshire. \u201cWhen American Airlines flight 11 came to me, the pilot said, \u2018Boston Center, this is American 11, climbing to flight level two-three-zero [23,000 feet]\u2019.\n\n\u201cI called him many, many times.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s these transmissions. The first transmission from the aircraft, it\u2019s garbled to me.\u201d\n\nMohamed Atta, the leader of the 19 terrorists, had killed the pilots on the Boeing 767 and taken over the flight deck. He had intended to address the passengers. But instead he spoke to air traffic control.\n\n\u201cI remember him saying, \u2018Nobody move, please. We\u2019re going back to the airport.\u2019 I will never forget that feeling. Oh, my God! The plane\u2019s being hijacked.\u201d\n\nThe pilots on United 175 also heard Atta\u2019s commands, and reported to New York air-traffic control: \u201cWe heard a suspicious transmission from on our departure from BOS \u2013 sounds like someone keyed the mike and said, \u2018Everyone stay in your seats\u2019.\u201d\n\nTen minutes later, controllers attempted to pass on more instructions.\n\n\u201cUnited 175, do you read New York?\u201d There was no response.\n\nOn board the Boeing 767, passengers made frantic calls to their loved ones. Peter Hanson, who was travelling with his wife, Sue, and two-year-old daughter, Christine, told his father: \u201cI think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, if it happens it\u2019ll be very fast.\u201d\n\nChristine Hanson was the youngest victim on 11 September.\n\nAfter American 77 hit the Pentagon, the national operations manager at the Federal Aviation Administration Command Center in Virginia, Ben Sliney, made an unprecedented order.\n\n\u201cI walked down to the middle of the floor, and everyone came over to me, and I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to land everyone at the nearest airport, regardless of destination\u2019.\n\n\u201cI expected some pushback. Out of 4,500 aircraft in the air, I only got one request to land at an airport that was not the nearest one.\n\n\u201cI refused the request.\u201d\n\nGerald Earwood was the captain of the second-last aircraft to land at La Guardia airport in New York: \u201cThey put us on a taxiway, pointing at the World Trade Center, watching the World Trade Center burn.\u201d\n\nCaptain Earwood was also in command of the first aircraft to leave New York, Midway Express 7, when flights began again on 13 September.\n\nWith the passengers onboard, someone made a bomb threat against the aircraft.\n\n\u201cEveryone calmly evacuated the aircraft and walked out onto the runway. At that moment, one of our military aircraft flew over, and that got our attention.\u201d\n\nOnce the bomb scare was lifted and passengers re-boarded, Captain Earwood called the tower and said: \u201cConfirm with us that the military knows that we\u2019re about to be airborne here.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving confirmation, the aircraft took off.\n\n\u201cThey sent us right over the World Trade Center. It was moving.\u201d", "description": "Eighteen years after thousands died in the attacks on America on 11 September 2001, a new \u201cOral History of 9/11\u201d reveals graphic accounts of how the professionals in the aviation frontline responded as the horror of the day unfolded.
