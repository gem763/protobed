His trial began Tuesday in Fort Worth.\n\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that Tarrant County prosecutor Kevin Rousseau said Acosta-Ojeda shot Zelaya twice in the head while he slept. Zelaya's severed head was later found on a trail near AT&T Stadium in Arlington.\n\nRousseau told the jury that Acosta-Ojeda said he killed Zelaya because he recently confessed to shooting at Acosta-Ojeda's former home in Arlington months earlier. A day after the shooting, that house burned down.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty for the 30-year-old Acosta-Ojeda.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, http://www.star-telegram.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
