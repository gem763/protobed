In return, they are granted more freedom in choosing students, developing their curriculum, and how much they can charge in tuition.\u201cThese high schools have become too focused on getting students into top universities in the country,\u201d Yoo said. \u201cThe ministry will be working on converting all of them into regular high schools by 2025 and also improving the quality of education at regular high schools throughout the country.\u201dMoon spoke of scrapping these schools from his campaign days.A number of autonomous private high schools have already protested the idea this year, as some of them did not pass a special status test administered by local education offices to maintain their autonomous private high school status.In the briefing Friday, Yoo also mentioned a plan to help more high-school graduates find jobs. Yoo\u2019s announcement Friday regarding the college admissions system is a sudden departure from her former stance.On Monday, Yoo said during a parliamentary audit that the ministry will pay attention to improve transparency in the early admissions system, instead of expanding the standardized test score-based regular admissions quota. Then on Tuesday, Moon said in a speech at the Assembly that he will overhaul the college admissions system to improve fairness, stating that the government will come up with a plan to raise the portion of students who are accepted solely on the basis of their CSAT scores.The proposal was in response to growing public rage toward internships and extracurricular activities that children of the elite have enjoyed. Such opportunities often helped them gain admissions to top universities.A recent admissions fraud scandal involving Cho Min, daughter of Moon\u2019s key ally Cho Kuk, laid bare the practice, forcing him to step down as justice minister. Moon had also urged the ministry in September to reform the college admissions system.The education community is split. While some support the idea, the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union recently issued a statement to protest such a change.BY ESTHER CHUNG, PARK HYUNG-SOO [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
