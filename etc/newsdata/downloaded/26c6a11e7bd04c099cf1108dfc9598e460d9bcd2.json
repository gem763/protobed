Lawyers representing the complaint\u2019s defendants claim that it contains numerous falsities and unsupported accusations.\n\nThe complaint is the latest burst of controversy in the increasingly hairy and complicated story of Echo Fox\u2019s ongoing implosion. The saga began in April when Echo Fox investor Amit Raizada allegedly referred to another investor, Jace Hall, via the n-word. Since then, the company\u2019s leadership has been in public disarray; Rick Fox said he would to leave Echo Fox (and has not), its partners penned a letter about pushing him out, and League of Legends publisher Riot Games removed Echo Fox from its esports league.\n\nEcho Fox is one of the biggest names in esports, claiming top players in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Fortnite and Street Fighter. Forbes reported that the organisation was worth around $220 million last October. According to Tuesday\u2019s complaint, however, that valuation is now off-base.\n\nThe lengthy complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, describes allegations of fraud against Raizada and paints the Echo Fox investor as a double-dealing business partner. \u201cRaizada began manipulating numbers behind the scenes to his benefit while Fox engaged publicly as the face of esports, spreading the gospel of esports on panels,\u201d the complaint reads, adding, \u201cRaizada\u2019s fraudulent activity included self-dealing where he and [Echo Fox partner Stratton] Sclavos put Echo Fox into a tailspin by controlling the company\u2019s debt.\u201d\n\nIt also alleges that he and Stratton Sclavos, former co-owner of the San Jose Sharks, drove down Echo Fox\u2019s value as a result of Sclavos\u2019 alleged \u201cdrug-fuelled lifestyle,\u201d as well as Raizada misrepresenting the company\u2019s financial dealings. The complaint says the two siphoned millions to themselves or companies they own.\n\nIn a call to the Associated Press Thursday, Fox referred to Raizada as \u201ca con man.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also offers more specifics about the racist comments Raizada allegedly made against both Hall and Fox, which had sparked the initial public controversy. It alleges that Raizada referred to Hall as a \u201cn-word\u201d and Fox as a \u201cSand n-word.\u201d It continues on to claim that Raizada threatened Fox\u2019s family, saying he would \u201cPERSONALLY [F-WORD] HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.\u201d\n\nLast week, ESPN reported that Raizada, Sclavos and other partners had signed a letter intending to remove Fox from the company. According to ESPN, \u201cThe letter says that Fox repeatedly worked against the best interest of the company and his partners, alleging that he was negligent, forced the sale to auction by Riot Games and told others he would, \u2018burn this company to the ground.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver email, Raizada\u2019s lawyer sent a statement to Kotaku referring to Fox\u2019s lawsuit as \u201ca transparent attempt to divert attention from the train wreck he left behind at Echo Fox. . . Even worse, the lawsuit is littered with categorically false allegations about Amit Raizada, Stratton Sclavos, and others. If Rick Fox wants to blame someone for Echo Fox\u2019s failures, he should start by looking in the mirror.\u201d\n\nWhile Sclavos\u2019 lawyer did not respond to Kotaku\u2019s request for comment, she did tell ESPN that \u201cRick Fox\u2019s lawsuit is a senseless diatribe replete with false and wholly unsupported accusations about Stratton Sclavos and Amit Raizada. . . Contrary to Fox\u2019s propaganda, neither Sclavos nor Raizada misappropriated or misused any company funds. No monies paid to or for Raizada for his services were paid by Echo Fox or depleted any Echo Fox resources. Rather, Sclavos, Raizada, and their affiliates infused millions of dollars into Echo Fox over several years just so it could survive. Fox cannot say the same.\u201d\n\nThe full complaint is here:\n\nRick Fox, for his part, says that the situation has \u201c100% not tainted my love for esports,\u201d and he plans to \u201ccontinue on in esports.\u201d", "description": "A civil complaint filed by Echo Fox co-owner Rick Fox on Tuesday details new allegations of fraud, deceptive business practices and racism against Echo Fox business partners that, he believes, merit over $14,800,000 in damages.
