The only thing the \u201cnew me\u201d loves more than a mirror selfie is a self timed one,\u2019 she wrote in the caption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemingly having been warned by the powers that be at Instagram that she had broken a rule with her so-totally-ever-offensive nipples, she added: \u2018PS this is getting removed soon! I\u2019ve been warned by the gram gods !\u2019\n\nShe switched up her cami and headed outside (Picture: Miley Cyrus/Instagram)\n\nThe magic of a selfie timer (Picture: Miley Cyrus/Instagram)\n\n13 hours later, those photos are still shining. Either Instagram has gone soft on its once-tough rules, or Miley is one powerful flouter.\n\nPerhaps both?\n\nIt comes after Miley was forced to defend her controversial comments claiming \u2018you don\u2019t have to be gay\u2019 after she was slammed on Monday.\n\nWhile praising her new boyfriend Cody Simpson, she was seen to be hitting out at her marriage to Liam Hemsworth, while also slamming her relationship with Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nExplaining why it took her so long to start dating Cody despite knowing each other for years, Miley said: \u2018I was being a little too hardcore for him and his vibes and not allowing anyone in but now I am.\u2019\n\nMiley seems pretty happy with new boyfriend Cody (Picture: NEMO / BACKGRID)\n\nAppearing to take a swipe at her estranged husband Liam, the popstar continued: \u2018There are good people out there that just happen to have d**ks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u2019\n\nAddressing her sexuality, Miley added: \u2018There are good men out there guys, don\u2019t give up.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with d**ks out there, you\u2019ve just got to find them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018I just always thought I had to be gay because all guys were evil but it\u2019s not true.\u2019\n\nPunters took to social media to slam the star, calling her comments \u2018problematic\u2019. After facing backlash the singer has explained what she was intending to get across.\n\n\u2018I was talking sh*t about sucky guys,\u2019 she said on her Instagram Stories on Monday night.\n\nShe added: \u2018But let me be clear, YOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality. You are born as you are.\n\n\u2018It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am part of.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
