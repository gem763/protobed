debate kicks off | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer came out swinging for the fences in the opening moments of the federal election debate tonight, calling Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau a \"fraud\" who does not deserve to be prime minister.\n\n\"Mr Trudeau you are a phoney and you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country,\" Scheer said.\n\nThe Conservative leader was answering a question from a member of the audience on how he would, as prime minister, represent Canada's values and interests on the world stage.\n\nInstead, he said Trudeau did not know how many times he has worn blackface, that he pretended to value Indigenous peoples, then fired his former attorney general, who is Indigenous.\n\nScheer also accused Trudeau of claiming to be for the middle class while raising their taxes, a point Trudeau later challenged.\n\nCTV's Lisa Laflamme, moderator for the first topic, on leadership in Canada and the world, turned to People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier and asked him if he had the temperament for leadership, given the off-colour comments he has been making on Twitter.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the temperament for leadership required a leader to look for things that unite Canadians, rather than divide them.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is always wearing a mask at the outset of the English-language debate in Gatineau, Que. 0:35\n\nBernier interrupted Singh and then went on to interrupt and talk over every other leader, including Scheer, who called out Bernier for his anti-immigrant positions.\n\n\"You can be proud of Canada's history, you can be proud of our identity, you can be proud of the things we've done and accomplished in the world while at the same time welcoming people from all around the world,\" Scheer said.\n\nLeadership is service: May\n\nTrudeau said the temperament for being a good leader meant looking for things that unite Canadians rather than taking every opportunity to find things that will set one Canadian against another.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May said leadership is about service and that anyone wanting to be prime minister has to view running the country as a service for Canadians.\n\nThe six federal party leaders are in Gatineau, Que., tonight where they are facing off against one another in a two-hour English-language debate.\n\n'Your role on this stage seems to be to say publicly what Mr. Scheer thinks privately,' Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says to People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier during the English-language debate in Gatineau, Que. 1:07\n\nThe second segment of the debate centred on polarization, human rights and immigration.\n\nThe moderator, HuffPost Canada's Althia Raj, asked Singh if he was letting down Canadians by putting his party's electoral chances ahead of taking a stand on Bill 21 in Quebec, which bans certain civil servants from wearing religious symbols at work\n\nBill 21 divisions\n\nSingh said Bill 21 was something that \"hurts me, makes me feel bad\" and that he would put his efforts into services that build up people.\n\nBloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said that 70 per cent of people in Quebec support Bill 21 and that the rest of Canada should recognize that Quebecers can decide how they want to govern their own province.\n\nTrudeau attacked Singh and said that while he recognized the NDP leader had spoken eloquently on his experience with discrimination, he was disappointed Singh did not follow Trudeau's lead and say he would leave the door open to a federal court challenge of the law.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks about his battle against discrimination after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau challenges him to say he'll intervene on Quebec's secularism law. 1:15\n\n\"Yes it's awkward politically, because as Mr Blanchet says, it is very popular, but I am the only on on this stage who has said: yes, a federal government might have to intervene on this,\" Trudeau said.\n\nSingh said that living every day of his life as a visual religious minority was how he took a stand, to which Trudeau asked him why he did not have the courage to stand up for his convictions.\n\nSNC-Lavalin and Quebec\n\nScheer turned to Trudeau and said that in light of the Liberal leader's violation of ethics laws, specifically with reference to the SNC-Lavalin affair, when did he decide that the rules did not apply to him?\n\nTrudeau said he stood up for Canadian jobs and accused Scheer of being someone who would not have defended Quebec jobs.\n\nThat left an opening for Blanchet, who accused Scheer of using SNC-Lavalin to further his politics to the detriment of a Quebec company.\n\n\"When Mr. Trudeau tried to find a solution, he did it the wrong way and he admitted it. What you are doing Mr Scheer \u2026 is you are trading the idea that Quebec is corrupt,\" Blanchet said. \"Those 3,400 people [working for SNC-Lavalin] have done nothing wrong, now the value of the shares are going down, the employees are leaving, clients are leaving, and we are losing it all because of you.\"\n\nScheer said that regardless of the economic situation there was no excuse for a politician to interfere in a federal court case.\n\nIndigenous issues\n\nBernier said all the other leaders are happy with the way things are and just want to tweak the relationship Canada has with Indigenous peoples. He said he would look into implementing property rights on reserves as a start to a better relationship.\n\nMay said Indigenous leaders are saying that the No. 1 issue facing their people is climate change and that is where the government has to act.\n\nTrudeau said he inherited climate targets from the former Conservative government, but targets are not a plan and he has implemented a plan that is making a difference.\n\nMay attacked Trudeau with the line that he \"bought a pipeline\" and so was not really fighting climate change, to which Trudeau replied that \"a slogan is not a plan.\"\n\nReturning to the Indigenous relationship, Singh attacked Trudeau for ordering a judicial review of a recent Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that awarded compensation to Indigenous children harmed by the on-reserve child welfare system and under-funded child and family services.\n\nTrudeau said his government had moved forward on Indigenous issues in a way that other governments never did before, but there is still a great deal to do. He also said that children would be compensated when his government could ensure that it is done in the right way.\n\nScheer said that he backed a judicial review because when it comes to handing out billions of dollars it is important to get it right.\n\nIncome inequality\n\nA voter from Yellowknife asked the leaders what they would do about the growing problem of income inequality in Canada if they were to become prime minister.\n\nMay called for a commission to look at the tax code to see if it is fair.\n\nTrudeau touted his middle-class tax cuts and that he would be moving forward with another tax cut for low- and middle-income Canadians, while accusing Scheer of targeting his tax cuts toward the wealthy.\n\nBernier said all the other party leaders want to persist in running deficits but he would balance the budget in two years in part by recouping $5 billion from cancelling corporate welfare payments.\n\nSingh said that giving money to corporations for investments meant that the federal government did not have enough left over to invest in programs such as dental care and health care that matter to lower-income Canadians.\n\nScheer accused Trudeau of not really understanding the issue of affordability because he had a trust fund and that Conservative tax cuts would make a significant difference for people earning less than $47,000 a year.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe final topic of the evening, moderated by the CBC's Rosemary Barton, was the environment and energy.\n\nA member of the public from New Brunswick said that Canada was in the midst of a climate crisis and that this was the last election Canadians had before we reached the tipping point. He wanted leaders to answer the question of what they would do in the climate fight.\n\nScheer used the opportunity to attack Trudeau for using two campaign planes and excusing that choice by purchasing carbon offsets. Trudeau replied that Scheer did not buy carbon offsets because he does not believe in climate change.\n\nMay attacked Trudeau for buying the Trans Mountain pipeline, arguing that the government's emissions targets are guaranteed to miss the Paris targets. May went further, saying she hoped Trudeau did not get a majority because he would not make the necessary moves required to battle climate change.\n\nTrudeau replied that Conservative politicians at the provincial level had been elected premier on the back of promises to eliminate the federal carbon tax and a strong government with a plan was needed in Ottawa to stand against them.\n\nA different debate\n\nTonight's event is the only debate with all six party leaders being held in English.\n\nCBC.ca is carrying the debate live from the Canadian Museum of History.\n\nThe leaders are battling it out over five topics that include: affordability and economic insecurity, environment and energy, Indigenous issues, leadership in Canada and on the world stage and polarization around human rights and immigration.\n\nThe debate is being broken down into five segments, each built around one of the featured topics. The segments are differing from past debates by featuring a question from a voter, a question from a moderator, one leader questioning another and two leaders facing off against each another.\n\nThe leaders each have less than 20 minutes of air time to make their personal pitch to voters while fending off attacks from their opponents.\n\nThere are five moderators for tonight's debate: the CBC's Rosemary Barton, CTV's Lisa LaFlamme, Dawna Friesen from Global News, HuffPost Canada's Althia Raj and the Toronto Star's Susan Delacourt.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer came out swinging for the fences in the opening moments of the federal election debate tonight, calling Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau a 'fraud' who doesn't deserve to be prime minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288670.1570486255!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/six-leaders-bloc-ppc-crop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
