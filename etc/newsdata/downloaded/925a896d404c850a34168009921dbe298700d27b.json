They are the only superpower.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we are in a situation where the Trump administration\u2019s capricious way of dealing with foreign policy has led to complete confusion in the world today and has allowed some very bad actors to take centre stage.\u201d\n\nLord Robertson said that President Trump\u2019s actions had reminded Nato members that collectively they had \u201cpolitical clout\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe greatest strength of the Nato alliance is not the number of tanks, ships or planes, it is the values that underpin democratic societies \u2013 a free press, free speech, the rule of law and the separation of church and state,\u201d he said.\n\nLord Robertson was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival at an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of Nato.\n\n\"We have great, talented military. We\u2019re bringing them back home. Our military has never been stronger. But we\u2019re now acting as police.\" Others must step up! pic.twitter.com/7rFqZ5kGqk \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 9, 2019\n\nHe blamed the decision by MPs six years ago to reject then prime minister David Cameron\u2019s plan to bomb Syria in response to President Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons for the problems now.\n\n\u201cThat was a pivotal moment and led to the Americans pulling back and let the Russians in and in many ways a direct cause of a lot of the damage that is going on just now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t underestimate the burden that Turkey actually carries. There are 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey today and only 10% are accommodated in camps.\n\n\u201cTurkey hosts them and prevents them from leaving Turkey and crossing the Adriatic into the EU.\n\n\u201cThey now feel their national interests have been prejudiced and President Trump has taken a decision capriciously and maybe also to avoid attention being paid to other domestic problems, it is unconscionable what he has done in that case.\u201d\n\nFellow panellist Dr Karin Von Hippel, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, said that President Trump had given Turkey the \u201cgreen light\u201d to attack the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have been leading the fight against Isis.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that if Donald Trump does really care about countering Isis long-term, he is just given Isis this incredible boost by doing what he\u2019s just done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are guarding thousands of foreign fighters and they could say it\u2019s not our priority and could easily walk away from these prisons and these detention centres.\u201d\n\nRetired General Sir Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy supreme allied commander Europe, added: \u201cIt is an absolute tragedy that Britain and America\u2019s allies, the SDF, have been hung out to dry.\n\n\u201cThe other point is that who would have thought that if you rolled the clock back four years to the time when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, look at the rapprochement now, that is now in its own way a strategic shock.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let the Turks have secrets if the Russians are able to get hold of them, so it places Nato in a very difficult position.\u201d", "description": "Lord Robertson was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival at an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of Nato.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/08/wire-19619402-1570864424-934_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
