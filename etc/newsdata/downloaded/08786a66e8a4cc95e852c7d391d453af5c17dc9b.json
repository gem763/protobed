Right at the advent of heavy metal, its sound was defined by the deep and gnarly grind of Black Sabbath as much as by any riffing mania \u2013 and Sabbath birthed an entire genre all of their own: doom metal (a sub-genre that brought the tempo down with low-tuned guitars and a \"thicker\u201d sound).\n\nShoegaze created a sound you could feel yourself drifting into\n\nIndeed, in classic metal style, this oozed into a half dozen micro-genres: prog-doom, goth-doom, death-doom, sludge, stoner and drone. While many of these were specialist genres to say the least, they've ended up influencing some of the biggest bands in the world, with Nirvana being a prime example, taking strong cues from the implacable grind of Kurt Cobain's friends in Melvins and Earth, while Queens of the Stone Age emerged from a subsequent scene of desert stoner rock.\n\nIndie rock may have a reputation of being upbeat and scrappy, but it has also been known to resist the urge of speed, especially in the sounds of shoegaze, post-rock, dream-pop and slowcore. In the late 80s, British shoegaze bands like Ride and Galaxie 500 used sheets of processed guitar noise and softly murmured vocals to create a sound you could feel yourself drifting into. Slowdive and Spiritualized also kept this slow, levitational drift, inspiring generations of guitar bands to come.\n\nA prime example are Minnesota slowcore stalwarts Low, who recently told Radcliffe and Maconie that their defiance in playing to rock audiences that expected volume and energy \u201ccreated a strength behind this intention of being very quiet and... very slow\u201d. The experimental spaces of post-rock also created some of the most epically-inclined music of recent decades, with bands like Montreal's Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Icelanders Sigur R\u00f3s building vast soaring structures over long timescales, feeding back into not just the alternative rock world but neo-classical music and movie soundtracks too (more on those later).", "description": "The 7 ages of slow music: from jazz and soul to dub and post-rock", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p06pv4v0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
