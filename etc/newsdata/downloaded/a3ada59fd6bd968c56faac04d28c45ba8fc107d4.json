Like when Di Marco is selling shares in TechnologyOne \u2013 all 51 million of them since 2005, raising a stonking $108.72 million. The elder tech bro sold the largest part of that fortune through Wilsons, but when the firm\u2019s new head of research, Mark Bryan, downgraded TechnologyOne to a hold in August 2017, Di Marco let it rip, and this unhappy customer immediately took his business elsewhere. His last two sell-downs have reportedly been handled by UBS, where things must go his way.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, TechnologyOne is no stranger to aggressive accounting tactics in order to maximise its reported profits. When International Financial Reporting Standard 15 forced it to report $27 million less FY19 revenue, the company offset it by capitalising (and amortising over three to seven years) its research and development spending. That will have the convenient effect of augmenting pretax profit by $26 million in FY19. And, as luck would have it, pretax profit is a key measure of Di Marco\u2019s bonus. Which, after it vests, he can sell \u2026 through UBS!\n\nIf spreading empathy for a besieged Richard White is the point, we\u2019re not so sure Di Marco\u2019s the face for that campaign.", "description": "If spreading empathy for WiseTech's Richard White is the point, we're not sure Adrian Di Marco is the man for the job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/47817e1d683b534e4e8347cb7f2499c6466d61ef", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
