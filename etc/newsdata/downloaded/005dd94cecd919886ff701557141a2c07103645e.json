REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid has postponed his first budget statement which he had been due to give on Nov. 6 because of delays to Brexit and the government\u2019s attempts to call an early election, a Treasury source said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cParliament has voted for a delay.
