The trio had relatively low 2019 salaries and if their 2020 salaries had been included instead, the qualifying offer figure would have risen to $18.3 million.\n\nHarper\u2019s salary increases from $10 million this year to $26 million in 2020, Machado\u2019s from $10 million to $30 million and Trout\u2019s from $16 million to $36 million.\n\nGerrit Cole, Anthony Rendon, Didi Gregorius and Jake Odorizzi are among the players eligible for free agency. They could be joined by Stephen Strasburg, Aroldis Chapman and J.D. Martinez, who have the right to opt out of their deals.\n\nA qualifying offer can be made through the fifth day after the World Series, and a player has a week after that to accept. If a team makes a qualifying offer to a player who signs a major league contract with another club before the June amateur draft, his former club would receive a draft pick as compensation at the end of the first round.\n\nA free agent can be made a qualifying offer only if he has been with the same team continuously since opening day and has never received a qualifying offer before.\n\nQualifying offers began after the 2012 season, and only three of 80 offers have been accepted: New York Mets second baseman Neil Walker and Philadelphia pitcher Jeremy Hellickson after the 2016 season and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu last offseason.\n\nThe qualifying offer price started at $13.3 million in 2012, rose to $14.1 million in 2013, $15.3 million in 2014, $15.8 million in 2015, $17.2 million in 2016 and $17.4 million in 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The price of qualifying offers for Major League Baseball free agents dropped for the first time, falling by $100,000 to $17.8 million.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
