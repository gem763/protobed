It will now require new users to explicitly opt in to the use of facial recognition tech, rather than making it the default setting.\n\nMeanwhile, existing users familiar with the \u201ctag suggestions\u201d option will see those prompts disappear. A new \u201cface recognition setting\u201d will take its place \u2015 and unlike tag suggestions, it too will be off by default.\n\nFacebook artificial intelligence lead Srinivas Narayanan explained the changes in a blog post, noting that users who opt in to face recognition will help Facebook weed out fake accounts that impersonate real people by using stolen photos.\n\nAffected users will encounter the below prompt asking them to either opt in or opt out:\n\nFacebook users who didn't previously have the face recognition option will see this prompt, and will have to explicitly opt in to the program.

With fines of between $1,000 and $5,000 allowed per violation, Facebook could potentially be on the hook for billions in damages.\n\n\u201cThis biometric data is so sensitive that if it is compromised, there is simply no recourse,\u201d Shawn Williams, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class action suit, told Reuters in August. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Social Security card or credit card number where you can change the number. You can\u2019t change your face.\u201d\n\nAsked if the tech policy change is in response to the lawsuit, a Facebook spokesperson demurred, describing Tuesday\u2019s shift as \u201cthe last phase of a long-planned\u201d action.\n\nIn July, the Federal Trade Commission hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine for a slew of privacy violations. Despite being the biggest FTC fine in history, it was comparatively small relative to Facebook\u2019s tens of billions in annual revenue, and Facebook stock surged on the news.\n\nRelated...\n\nHere's What You Need To Know About Facebook's Colossally Bad Year\n\nHow Russia Uses Facebook To Lure Americans To Political Rallies\n\nCritics Say Facebook Penalty Is A Slap On The Wrist As Stock Prices Surge\n\nLove HuffPost?
