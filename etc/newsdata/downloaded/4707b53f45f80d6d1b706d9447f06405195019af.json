Hong Kong has never been known to be a politically conscious society,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing like this has ever been seen before and now people have been pushed to this edge \u2013 these young people are fighting for their lives and for their future.\u201d\n\nShe rejected allegations by Beijing that the movement was being provoked by the US or other international players. \u201cThis is a leaderless, centralised movement,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are still claiming there are foreign forces coming into the movement \u2026 it\u2019s just not the truth.\u201d\n\nBefore she was an activist, Ho was a singer. She launched her music career in the 1990s when she won a singing competition run by a Hong Kong TV station, but it wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s that she broke through into the mainstream. She began to identify publicly as a lesbian in 2012 \u2013 the first person in Cantopop to come out \u2013 and became an advocate for LGBT+ rights.\n\nIn 2014 she was arrested for taking part in the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. As a result she was blacklisted in mainland China, where she had a growing audience, and was dropped from major sponsorship deals and by her record label. She responded by starting her own label, and by intensifying her political activism.\n\nQuick guide What are the Hong Kong protests about? Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nDespite being billed as a talk about pop and politics, Ho\u2019s session at the annual ideas festival focused firmly on the latter. In conversation with the journalist Zing Tsjeng, Ho touched on her singing career only insofar as it related to her activism.\n\nArt and creative practice, she said, was a space in which \u201cthe fight can go on\u201d. \u201cThey can lock you up, they can ban you from going into the country, and they can censor your name on Chinese social media, but they cannot really control your mind.\u201d\n\nShe said she believed most celebrities had been \u201csilencing themselves\u201d on the political situation in Hong Kong \u201cfor fear of being blacklisted, as I have been, on the China market\u201d.\n\nThe audience gave no indication that they minded the singular focus of the event. Crowd members chanted pro-freedom slogans. Questions from the floor were focused mainly on protest strategy. They wanted to know what they could do from Australia to help their families at home. They called out in encouragement and support when the event took an emotional turn.\n\nHo was brought to tears as the audience was shown a short video summarising the months of protests, which were triggered in June by the introduction of a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China to face court. The bill was seen as an attempt by Beijing to undermine democracy in the relatively liberal territory, governed by China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.\n\nHong Kong: riot police pursue pro-democracy protesters from airport Read more\n\nNews had emerged in the past 48 hours that police had fired dye-filled water cannons at people in the street. They had disguised their identities and violently arrested protesters, as well as attacking them in a train carriage at a metro station, pepper spraying them and beating them with batons.\n\n\u201cThe police have really been completely out of hand, and so Hong Kong people are furious,\u201d Ho said.\n\nHo said she expected the crisis to escalate in the lead-up to celebrations on 1 October to mark the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen during this month, nobody will really answer this question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we can really do in this moment is become more united in this fight and become really strategic in the face of this huge machine that is the [Chinese] communist government.\u201d\n\nShe said six young people had killed themselves \u201cbecause of despair\u201d during the protest period.\n\n\u201cI really want the world to know that although we are seeing a lot of violence from all sides at this moment, this really started out as a largely peaceful protest in June,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe tried all sorts of ways to get our voices heard, to get to the government. But they only responded with teargas, more teargas, rubber bullets, sponge bullets, police brutality.\u201d", "description": "Cantopop star says city has become a police state as young people fight for their lives", "authors": ["Stephanie Convery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c395c9b7853eb531d9b34d05fe0d98aa7b85964/0_47_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6e49f41b3634e72c7c3fb9617d93087"}
