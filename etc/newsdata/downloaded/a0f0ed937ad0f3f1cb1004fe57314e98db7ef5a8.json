To the top-left of the photograph is the much larger Collerton home with the driveway running alongside it. Next to the garage at the end of the driveway is the Vance home, where they have now created a parking space in their front garden (the parking space is not visible in the photograph as it was created later). The space is the subject of this recent court battle\n\nA 'substantial hedge and fence' and a pedestrian gate at the end of the driveway were removed by the Vances so they could get their car through to the new parking space, London's High Court heard last week.\n\nThe Collertons say their neighbours had no right to remove the fence and pedestrian gate so they can get the Mercedes through.\n\nThey want to put the fence back in and are demanding the Vances pay for the work, which would effectively landlock their parking space.\n\nThe court heard that the Vances bought their picturesque country home, Queen Anne's Cottage, Berry Hill, Taplow, four years ago.\n\nMrs Vance, a former international pentathlete and horsewoman, now presents showjumping and equestrian sports on CNN.\n\nPrior to her TV career, Mrs Vance represented Britain in the modern pentathlon and was a formidable horsewoman, once fighting her way back from a broken neck to compete in the 2008 Horse of the Year Show.\n\nThe Collertons, who live next door in \u00a31.5m six-bed Queen Anne's House, run a sports website, while Mrs Collerton, 61, is herself an accomplished sportswoman, having been a world-class rower who once represented Britain.\n\nMr Justice Kerr heard that after buying their spacious whitewashed cottage, Mr and Mrs Vance revamped part of the house and took out a section of picket fence and a pedestrian gate to improve vehicle access to their cottage.\n\nTheir building programme included creating an area of hard standing directly in front of the cottage where the Vances assumed they would be able to park cars.\n\nA 'substantial hedge and fence' and a pedestrian gate at the end of the driveway were removed by the Vances so they could get their car through to the new parking space, London's High Court heard last week (the Vances are pictured outside court)\n\nThe Collertons (pictured outside London's High Court), who live next door in \u00a31.5m six-bed Queen Anne's House, run a sports website, while Mrs Collerton, 61, is herself an accomplished sportswoman, having been a world-class rower who once represented Britain\n\nIn a more up-to-date photograph, the Vance's parking space can be seen in front of their property. Mrs Vance has to use a drive belonging to the Collertons in order to access it\n\nBut the Collertons protested, insisting that the fence and gate be put back at their new neighbours' expense.\n\nThey claimed that the right of way allowing the Vances to use their drive only extended to cars dropping off or picking up, and that it could not be used as an access lane to their newly-installed parking space.\n\nThe Vances' QC, Jonathan Gaunt, told the judge that the two couples also clashed over where the Collertons parked their own Peugeot car, with the Vances claiming it prevented safe access to the cottage at all.\n\n'The Collertons had been accustomed to park their car in front of the garage where it would obstruct vehicular access to the cottage,' he told the court.\n\n'They then started parking instead at the entrance to the driveway in a manner which obstructed the ability of the Vances to reverse into and up the driveway.'\n\nHe said Mrs Vance complained that, when parked at the entrance to the drive, her neighbours' Peugeot prevents her reversing safely along the pavement and into the access with her child in the back seat.\n\nInstead, she would have to reverse from the middle of the road, which she feels is unsafe.\n\nShe and her husband sued their neighbours for alleged obstruction of their right of way, seeking a court ruling that they are entitled to park in front of their cottage.\n\nBut in October last year, a judge at Central London County Court rejected their case, finding that the Vances 'could not open up the cottage for parking purposes'.\n\nJudge Nicholas Parfitt said those who drew up the legal document creating the right of way had not intended it to be used as access to a parking space at the cottage.\n\nUsing the right of way 'to take a car onto the cottage land was not in the objective contemplation of the parties' who drew it up in the first place, he said.\n\nThe judge said the removed fence and gate were jointly owned by both sets of neighbours and told the Vances to put them back and to cough up the cash to pay for it.\n\nThe Vances are now appealing that ruling in the High Court, seeking to get it reversed.\n\nThe Collertons claim that the right of way allowing the Vances to use their drive (pictured) only extends to cars dropping off or picking up, and that it can't be used as an access lane to their parking space (part of their house is pictured left)\n\nMr Gaunt said the right of way granted to the Vances 'was for all purposes' and ought to extend to them using it to reach their parking area.\n\n'The wording of the deed \"for all purposes\" was quite wide enough to cover the creation of a car parking space in front of the cottage, to which access could be obtained over the driveway,' he said.\n\nAnd he says an injunction should be granted, banning the Collertons from parking at the entrance to the driveway, as it interferes with Mrs Vance's ability to use the pavement to reverse in.\n\nThe Collertons are cross-appealing, amongst other things, against the finding by the judge that they were interfering with Mrs Vance's ability to reverse up the driveway.\n\nKerry Bretherton, the Collertons' QC, defended their positioning of their Peugeot, saying that the entrance to the drive is the only part wide enough to allow two vehicles to pass.\n\n'The Collertons parked in this position only after the Vances started driving onto the Queen Anne's Cottage garden,' she told the judge.\n\n'They did so to enable the Vances driving onto Queen Anne's Cottage land - pending trial - because the drive was too narrow for such access if the Collertons continued to park outside the derelict garage, as they had done since September 1995.'\n\nShe continued: 'The evidence contained in recordings was that numerous vehicles, including those of far larger size than a car, could pull onto the drive past the Collertons' car.\n\n'The Vances are entitled to park on the driveway solely for the purpose of loading and unloading and are able to do so.\n\n'Mrs Vance is not entitled to adopt a method of pulling onto the drive which is unique to her and prevents the Collertons from parking to the side at the front of the drive.'\n\nThe dispute has been processing through the courts for over a year and has clocked up tens of thousands in legal costs.\n\nAsked outside court what the legal costs' bill had come to, Mrs Collerton said wryly: 'much too much'.\n\nMr Justice Kerr will give his ruling in the case at a later date.", "description": "Aly Vance, 35, and her media boss husband, Sebastian, are locked in a court battle with their Buckinghamshire neighbours, Christopher and Carol-Ann Collerton, 61.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20175582-0-image-a-38_1571999657683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
