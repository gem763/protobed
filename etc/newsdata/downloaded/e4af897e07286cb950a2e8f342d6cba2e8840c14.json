That\u2019s a combined 480 billion metric tons, chiefly from the combustion of their products, says the Climate Accountability Institute.\n\nOpinion: It\u2019s only a matter of time before oil runs out of gas and electric vehicles power ahead\n\nSays Richard Heede, director of the U.S.-based organization behind the data: \u201cEven though global consumers from individuals to corporations are the ultimate emitters of carbon dioxide, the [institute] focuses its work on the fossil-fuel companies that, in our view, have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to noncarbon fuels.\u201d\n\nThe high stakes of geopolitics can\u2019t be ignored: Saudi Arabia is one of the more controversial U.S. energy allies given its human-rights record and the notorious murder of U.S.-based journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi; the U.S. has levied oil sanctions on Iran that have implications for global markets; and Russian interference in U.S. elections and its role in shaping global natural-gas markets remain key issues heading into the U.S. 2020 presidential race. Meanwhile, for its part, under Trump the U.S. has pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord with a finger-point to noncompliance elsewhere and industry influence at times in step, then out of sync, with the White House.\n\nThe global polluters list uses company-reported annual production of oil, natural gas and coal and then calculates how much of the carbon and methane in the produced fuels is emitted to the atmosphere throughout the supply chain, from extraction to end use. CAI found that 90% of the emissions attributed to the top 20 climate culprits was from use of their products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, natural gas and thermal coal. One-tenth came from extracting, refining and delivering the finished fuels.\n\nRead: Companies are too slow with shift to carbon neutral, say investors with $35 trillion at stake\n\nThe data set\u2019s starting point, 1965, is not random. That\u2019s the year from which the environmental impact of fossil fuels has been known to industry leaders and politicians, experts say.\n\nThat\u2019s when President Lyndon Johnson released a report from a science advisory council on fossil fuels, pollution and a global warm-up called \u201cRestoring the Quality of Our Environment.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s what the leader of the trade group the American Petroleum Institute, perhaps surprisingly, chipped in that year: \u201cOne of the most important predictions of the [president\u2019s report] is that carbon dioxide is being added to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas at such a rate by the year 2000 the heat balance will be so modified as possibly to cause marked changes in climate beyond local or even national efforts.\u201d\n\nFlash forward to a study earlier this year that found five of the largest stock-market-listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200 million each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper, which had first crack at the Climate Accountability Institute results, said the response from the companies on the list was varied: Most didn\u2019t respond to the paper\u2019s request for comment; others said current leadership couldn\u2019t be responsible for historical policy; and some highlighted their efforts to follow the emissions reductions set out in the Paris accord.
