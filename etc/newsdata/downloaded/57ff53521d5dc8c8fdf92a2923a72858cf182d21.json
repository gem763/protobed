White mould is dangerous to plants and is a disease. But it also looks like slime mould, which is not dangerous to plants,' she wrote.\n\nWoolworths shoppers have been warned of a new strain of mould resembling dog vomit that has affected the popular Discovery Gardens plants (an example of the mould)\n\nThe Discovery Garden gives shoppers one seedling to plant at home for every $30 they spend in store, with chives, coriander, carrot, basil and beetroot all included\n\n'So I do not know which one it is. But i will try my luck by repotting these on their own and hopefully, they will grow still.'\n\nSlime Mould or \u2018Dog Vomit Mould' resembles a canines' stomach contents due to its thick consistency.\n\nAlthough many people being grossed out by the bright yellow, white or orange mould, it is relatively harmless to humans.\n\nHowever, plant website Master Gardener warns that the 'dusty spores can irritate people with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions.'\n\nGrowers of edible plants, such as Discovery Garden herbs and vegetables, are advised to remove all slime.\n\n'There is generally no need to control these odd organisms, but if it is really bothering someone, an aethalium can be raked out or scraped off, or broken up and allowed to dry out to make it less noticeable,' the gardening website advises.\n\n'Stirring up the mulch will help break up any plasmodia as well as dry out the area to make it less hospitable for slime mold growth.\n\n'Using something other than hardwood bark for mulch (such as gravel, pine bark, cedar bark, or pine straw) and reducing excessive watering will reduce the likelihood of the slime mold showing up, but won\u2019t eliminate it.'\n\nA Woolworths spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that mould can be a natural part of the process when it comes to growing natural products.\n\n'If you see mould appearing, we suggest gently wiping it off with a tissue or cloth. If in doubt, you may wish to dispose of the plant as a precaution,' he said.\n\nDespite being relatively low risk to humans, the dusty spores can irritate people with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions\n\n'Although the mould doesn\u2019t damage the plant, it is unsightly and usually indicates that the pots are being overwatered and have poor drainage or circulation.'\n\nThis isn't the first time the supermarket giant's Discovery Garden plants have been prone to unsightly mould outbreaks.\n\nLast month shoppers noticed large clumps of white mould growing in the soil of their plants.\n\nOn the Discovery Garden website, it says the mould is caused by the moisture in the air and suggests 'you can wipe it away with a tissue'.\n\nWhile some people endeavoured to try this remedy they said the mould simply grew back after a time.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Woolworths for comment.", "description": "Pots and seedlings in Woolworths Australia's range of mini promotional plants have been struck by the unsightly slime mould.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/19468888-0-image-a-41_1570581514455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
