The proceeds of the sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, production and development and potential acquisitions.\n\nNetflix is issuing debt after reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates and saw overseas growth that helped sooth investors\u2019 concerns about a slowdown at home. The company burned through $551 million of cash in the third quarter and is \u201cslowly\u201d moving toward becoming free cash flow positive, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a letter to shareholders last week.\n\nIn the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market for its investment needs, he said.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company reiterated expectations to burn through $3.5bn in cash this year as the war for content heats up. It\u2019s been raising prices - often at the expense of subscriber gains - in some of its largest territories, trying to shift toward profitability as streaming service competition mounts from companies such as Walt Disney, AT&T and Apple.\n\nNetflix has historically relied on the high-yield bond market to finance its growth, typically issuing debt following its first- and third-quarter earnings in April and October, respectively. Its debt load, including operating lease liabilities, has steadily grown to around $13.5bn since first tapping the market in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company last borrowed $2.24bn of junk bonds in April, and said that it would reduce its reliance on debt financing at the time. CEO Hastings walked back that language in a July letter to shareholders, saying Netflix planned to still use the high-yield market to fund content investments.\n\nNetflix\u2019s shares and bonds were little changed in early trading in New York. The stock opened at around $276 Monday.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the bond sale, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The notes are expected to price Tuesday, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private.", "description": "Netflix is selling bonds as it works to bolster its original content in the face of greater competition.", "authors": ["Molly Smith", "Elizabeth Rembert"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2791/5ce71bce0ea34306ada19d107e56b5da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
