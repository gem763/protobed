USA TODAY\n\nA few days before the season kicked off, Gus Malzahn gathered his players and took them through Auburn\u2019s schedule. He wanted them to see, as he put it, \u201cthe big picture\u201d \u2013 because then he wanted them to stop seeing it, and instead focus only on what was directly ahead.\n\nFive games in, the Tigers are undefeated and ranked No. 7 in the Amway Coaches Poll. They visit No. 8 Florida Saturday. Which means there\u2019s little danger anyone will view the season through a wide-angle lens.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think that way,\u201d Malzahn says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think that way.\u201d\n\nAuburn running back JaTarvious Whitlow is tackled by Mississippi State linebacker Leo Lewis during their game on Sept. 28, 2019. (Photo: John Reed, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCertainly not this week, when the Gators host the first Top 10 matchup at Florida Field since 2012. ESPN\u2019s College GameDay will set up camp, conveying the ultimate stamp of college football bigness. There\u2019s no reason for Malzahn and his players to think any bigger.\n\nBut we should.\n\nFor Auburn, Florida and No. 6 LSU, the month of October features a triangle of doom.\n\nFirst, a word about September, which was a heady time to be an SEC fan. We know, that\u2019s SEC fans\u2019 steady state. But during the first month of this season, it has been especially exhilarating \u2013 and at least mildly surprising \u2013 as LSU, Auburn and Florida joined preseason favorites Alabama (ranked No. 1) and Georgia (No. 3) near the top of the rankings and in many of those faux projections for the College Football Playoff.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nWEEKEND FORECAST: Staff picks for Auburn-Florida and every big game\n\nHOT SEAT: Eight coaches feeling pressure after the first month of season\n\nWith a suddenly wide-open offense, LSU won a road shootout against Texas in one of the biggest non-conference matchups of the season. With a devastating defense and a rapidly growing freshman quarterback fueling a developing offense, Auburn found its way past Oregon, then dominated at Texas A&M and against Mississippi State. Florida doesn\u2019t have a similar signature win, but with an aggressive, mean defense, the Gators are 5-0 for the first time since 2015.\n\nThey\u2019re all in the Top 10, with reason to dream of climbing even higher. Come November, each gets its shot against Alabama or Georgia \u2013 or in Auburn\u2019s case, against both. But first, they have to navigate a defining triangle.\n\nOn Saturday, we get Auburn at Florida. Next week, Florida is at LSU. Two weeks after that, Auburn visits Baton Rouge.\n\nThree hopefuls, all locked into a round-robin tournament of sorts. Who emerges unscathed? Will any? It\u2019s possible that Auburn, Florida and LSU beat each other up, that by the time November arrives, none is a realistic SEC contender, much less for the College Football Playoff. Or that if one goes 2-0, it\u2019s worn down from the grind.\n\nNot that anyone is complaining (yet).\n\n\u201cThis is why you come to Florida, to play in big, big games like this,\u201d says Florida coach Dan Mullen of the Auburn matchup. \u201cI think (the players) know this is here and you\u2019ve got to pick up the intensity. This is what you go for.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for Auburn and LSU. And then they\u2019ll go for it again, all the way through October. And if they do?\n\nThe Gators play Georgia Nov. 2 in their annual battle in Jacksonville. A week later, LSU travels to Tuscaloosa to play the Crimson Tide. And Auburn \u2013 well, wow. With what might be the nation\u2019s most difficult schedule, Auburn gets Georgia Nov. 16 and Alabama Nov. 30. At least they\u2019re both at Jordan-Hare Stadium.\n\nIt could be epic fun, because what we\u2019ve seen so far from LSU, Auburn and Florida provides hope that instead of simply fast-forwarding to yet another matchup between \u2018Bama vs. Georgia in the SEC championship game, we might be in for something new and different. But it all begins Saturday in Gainesville. The winner advances to the next round still unbeaten, with larger goals still intact. Just don\u2019t try to get them to acknowledge it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at it,\u201d Malzahn says. \u201cI mean it\u2019s whatever \u2013 this is Florida. This is it. This is our game.\u201d\n\nNext week, when the buzz shifts to Florida at LSU, Auburn has an open date. And then after that?\n\n\u201cI think our next game is a road game,\u201d Malzahn says.\n\nWe\u2019re pretty sure he knows it\u2019s at Arkansas. And that he\u2019s well aware of what comes after that in the bigger picture.", "description": "Auburn, Florida and LSU all have started the football season 5-0.
