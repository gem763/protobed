REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission staff reviewing Roche\u2019s (RBO.PA) plan to buy U.S.-based gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics (ONCE.O) for $4.3 billion recommended that the deal be approved without requiring any asset sales, the Capitol Forum reported on Thursday.\n\nBasel-based Roche, the biggest maker of cancer drugs, said in February that it would buy the U.S. company, acquiring a portfolio that includes a blindness treatment that has U.S. and European approval and other projects for neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington\u2019s disease. One of its projects is a gene therapy treatment for hemophilia.\n\nThe FTC staff had focused on hemophilia treatments since Roche markets Hemlibra, the report said.\n\nFollowing the staff\u2019s recommendation, officials at the top of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition must weigh in. The next step would be a vote by the FTC chairman and four commissioners.\n\nThe deal must also win approval from the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, which said this week that it had a deadline of mid-December for a Phase 1 decision. A Phase 2 probe would be more in-depth and detailed.\n\nRoche, Spark and the FTC all declined comment.", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission staff reviewing Roche's plan to buy U.S.-based gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics for $4.3 billion recommended that the deal be approved without requiring any asset sales, the Capitol Forum reported on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444647527&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N23N", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
