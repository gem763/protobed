Those who knew him say he gave off joy like it was a superpower, enveloping everyone he knew in the glow.\n\nLast month, a day before starting second grade, the seven-year-old was shot dead in crossfire outside his home.\n\nHis story is grimly familiar in St Louis, Missouri, a city of more than 300,000 that sits on the west bank of the Mississippi River and where 13 black children have been fatally shot since April.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Xavier Usanga. Photograph: Courtesy the Usanga family\n\nHad those 13 children died in one fast hail of bullets, that tally would rank in the nation\u2019s 20 deadliest mass shootings. If they had been white, it is likely they would have had more media attention.\n\nInstead, these children died in the dilapidated parts of town most people are told to avoid \u2013 sometimes alone, sometimes as family stood helplessly by. In these corners of the city, parents tell their children the loud banging outside is fireworks, but because it is really gunfire, they don\u2019t let them outside to see.\n\nXavier was in his backyard. He was heading back from a neighbor\u2019s house with two of his older sisters \u2013 Trinity, 10, and Angel, 12 \u2013 when gunshots rang out. The girls ran into their home, where they realized Xavier wasn\u2019t with them, and turned back and found his body under a bush. They told their grandmother he took a deep breath and was gone.\n\nMichael Johnson, a pastor who helped support the family, was close to Xavier and was with his mother to help identify the body. Johnson said Xavier was \u201ca sponge for love \u2013 he needed it, he absorbed it\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe would never walk into a room without coming to give you a hug, whether you saw him an hour earlier or you saw him two weeks ago,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe always came, looked at you, and smiled and wanted a hug.\u201d\n\nXavier\u2019s mother, Dawn Usanga, told the Guardian that Xavier \u201clit up every room he walked into\u201d and was popular with many people in their neighborhood.\n\n\u201cFor seven years old, I don\u2019t know, he was just so innocent, he was sweet, everybody just took to him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think the only thing that gives me any kind of comfort is that St Louis never got to ruin my son,\u201d Usanga said. \u201cAnything could have gotten to him \u2013 drugs, the violence, the guns, influences of other kids. Children can get turned around so fast and get running and do the wrong things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An abandoned building is adorned with chalk art pleading for an end to violence in north St Louis.

This violence disproportionately affects the city\u2019s poor black neighborhoods, and this year children as young as two have become a symbol for how entrenched the city is in violence. St Louis County, the suburbs which border the city, have also seen a high child murder rate with seven children shot dead.\n\nSt Louis\u2019s mayor, Lyda Krewson, has offered $25,000 for information on four of the dead children\u2019s cases, a grand total of $100,000. The city is also planning to spend $500,000 on the lauded crime reduction program, Cure Violence, and another $1.5m on violence prevention efforts.\n\nThe city also has programs to provide food, recreation and jobs to low-income people, as well as large-scale efforts to demolish derelict homes. This year, St Louis plans to tear down 700 homes, and has programs that allow people to purchase homes for $1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multipronged effort, but we all know this violence is a function of generational poverty and a lack of opportunity and it\u2019s something that St Louis is not immune to just like all these other cities,\u201d said Koran Addo, director of communications for the office of the mayor.\n\nMissouri\u2019s governor, Mike Parson, announced on 19 September that the state would deploy more police to the area and provide prosecutorial assistance. This plan of \u201ctargeting violent criminals and getting them off the street\u201d does not include any changes to the state\u2019s lax gun laws, which allow people to carry handguns and rifles without a permit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A memorial for 3-year-old Kennedi Powell is seen outside her grandmother\u2019s house in south St. Louis on Friday, Sept. 13, 2019. The toddler was killed while outside the house in June of this year in a drive-by shooting, while another bullet injured her 6-year-old neighbor. At least 13 children have died of gunshot wounds in St. Louis city this year, and six children in St. Louis Country have been killed by gunfire. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\nThere is a deep distrust of police in the city and people in the affected neighborhoods said they can\u2019t see a way out of the problem without addressing the lack of jobs, neglected buildings and drug addiction. And because guns are so easily purchased illegally, there is little faith that strengthening the state\u2019s weak gun control laws would resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cMore young men have access to guns than wallets in their back pockets,\u201d said James Clark, vice-president of community outreach for the not-for-profit Better Family Life. \u201cThat\u2019s a major issue, but now, it\u2019s one thing to have a gun, it\u2019s another thing to be willing to pull that trigger.\u201d\n\nClark said family and community structures in the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods have disintegrated so much that things have become more violent, fueled by a lack of hope and support.\n\nBetter Family Life runs a gun violence de-escalation program, providing mediation in interpersonal conflicts that could result in gun violence, and a Clean Sweep program that works to demolish abandoned and blighted buildings that have overtaken the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThe root cause of violence is poverty. It took us 10 years to all agree on that. It will take at least three generations to eradicate poverty, at least three, and that\u2019s if we started right now,\u201d Clark said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A memorial filled with toys, flowers and photos for Xavier Usanga outside his home in north St Louis.

But as the numbers rose, with children getting caught in crossfire while playing outside their houses or killed inside their own homes, the anxiety grew.\n\nThe first and youngest child to die this year in St Louis city was two-year-old Kayden Johnson. He and his mother, Trina\u2019ty Riley, were found dead in their home in May. Elijah Johnson, the father of the child, told KMOV4 that he was heartbroken after the shooting. \u201cJust a lot of pain, it was unbelievable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI could not believe it.\u201d\n\nThere have been no public developments in the case on who killed Kayden and his mother, nor has their been much progress in finding who is responsible for the other deaths.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An abandoned building is adorned with artwork pleading for an end to violence in north St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\nOnly one of the cases have seen someone charged with homicide \u2013 the killing of Sentonio Cox, 15.\n\nSentonio, who was retreating with his hands up when he was shot, according to court papers, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in a lot down the street from his home. He was the second of his mother\u2019s six children to be fatally shot. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nightmare that you can\u2019t get over, like a bottomless pit,\u201d Roxyzanna Edwards, his mother, told KSDK.\n\nPolice have charged two men, aged 47 and 54, with Sentonio\u2019s murder.\n\nThe same weekend Sentonio was killed, Nyla Banks, 10, and Jurnee Thompson, eight, were also fatally shot. No one has been charged in the deaths of the two young girls.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jurnee Thompson, Kristina Curry and Kennedi Powell Photograph: via Gun Memorial website and Twitter\n\nKim Gardner, the circuit attorney for the city of St Louis, said the city and state needed to take this systemic cycle of trauma into account to combat gun violence. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of this, we can\u2019t prosecute our way out of this. We have to figure out why a person is picking up a gun and shooting into a crowd,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is the first black female prosecutor in St Louis and has faced severe criticism while promoting progressive criminal justice reform.\n\nThe state has prioritized policing in responding to gun violence, and directly challenged efforts to address poverty, such as when Missouri\u2019s government voted to lower the minimum wage from $10 to $7.90 an hour in 2017 (voters passed a law in November 2018 to increase it again).\n\nIn the past decade, Missouri has also made it easier for people to obtain guns. In the state, anyone 19 or older can legally carry a concealed weapon without a concealed-carry permit or any training. These changes coincided with a 16% increase in homicides over a six-year period where the nationwide gun homicide rate decreased.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators march through the streets while protesting the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown on 23 November 2014, in St Louis, Missouri.

He, like others, also doesn\u2019t think it would address the underlying issues driving someone to use a gun to resolve a conflict.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say why somebody shouldn\u2019t do what they do if they feel hopelessness, I don\u2019t know their mental state or how to stop that, but what I do know is we can stop those conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe does outreach with the group HandsUp United, a collective which provides food, technical classes and social justice education to the community. As a father of four, T-Dubb-O is also focused on keeping his children away from the chains of poverty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what I have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it means going back to selling drugs. I\u2019ll make sure I have life insurance, and if somebody kills me, then they\u2019ll have enough money to survive and go off to a nice college and I got a wonderful woman who will make sure they go at it in the correct way.\u201d\n\nT-Dubb-O and his partner, Rika Tyler, were part of the uprising in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis which attracted international attention in August 2014 after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.\n\nTyler lived five minutes away from where Brown was killed and went to the scene as the teenager\u2019s body lay in the street for four hours. She said the intense protests that followed were about more than just Brown: it was an expression of frustration with how the black community in St Louis, and across the US, encounters more policing, fewer job opportunities, worse health outcomes and lower-quality schools.\n\n\u201cIt was just the straw that broke the people\u2019s back,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elaborate stone and iron gates prevent traffic from passing through some wealthy residential areas of neighborhoods, like the Central West End in St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\nA long history of racial discrimination and segregation\n\nMissouri hosted one of the most prominent legal controversies about slavery when Dred Scott, enslaved at birth, fought slavery in the US supreme court. The court ruled in 1857 that Scott and other African Americans cannot be considered American citizens, setting up course for the civil war.\n\nIn the early 1900s, just 50 years after slavery was abolished in the US, St Louis voted in favor of an ordinance that prevented someone from moving into a neighborhood if it was predominantly home to people of another race. Though the supreme court struck down the ordinance, city planners had families in certain neighborhoods sign documents saying they would never sell to an African American family. Housing discrimination was outlawed in 1968 but in practice segregation persists.\n\nWeaving between blocks in St Louis, and the suburbs that surround it in St Louis county, the racial and class divides are blatant. In the city\u2019s JeffVanderLou neighborhood, the life expectancy is 18 years lower than it is in the wealthy, majority-white suburb it borders, Clayton, according to a 2014 report.\n\nIn Clayton, which is in St Louis county, 78% of residents are white and the median household income is $90,000, while in JeffVanderLou 95% are black and the median household income is $15,000.\n\nDrive about nine minutes from the city\u2019s ritzy Central West End and the clothing boutiques, artisanal ice-cream shops and cafes quickly give way to crumbled homes and emptied streets. Sex workers and people with drug addictions occupy the playgrounds and children are mostly kept indoors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An ambulance drives down Page Boulevard in north St Louis.

She was offered such a position, but couldn\u2019t take it after failing the required eye exam because she hasn\u2019t been able to afford glasses since losing her security guard job in May.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be living like this,\u201d she said, as her five-year-old, Mark, and three-year-old, Kenzi, buzzed around her legs.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d be living like this Yolanda Whittier\n\nWhen Whittier pulls back the heavy, dark curtains covering her living room windows, she sees one potential answer to some of the problems in her community.

Malik Ross, 27, was arrested for theft and told police he shot Xavier accidentally after seeing men with a gun on a nearby porch. \u201cIt was them or me,\u201d he told police. He has not been charged with the murder.\n\nXavier\u2019s grandmother, Mary Norwood, has lived in Ferguson for 12 years, a few blocks from where Brown was killed on West Florissant Avenue. She avoids driving down the busy thoroughfare because it still reminds her of the smoke, smell and noise from the weeks of protests.\n\nFor 66 years, she has watched family and friends go to prison, struggle with addiction and drop dead. One nephew was fatally shot by police and Norwood was addicted to drugs and alcohol until 1993. A survivor of domestic abuse, she is now studying for her third master\u2019s degree.\n\nAfter Xavier was shot, Norwood took care of her youngest granddaughters, who witnessed the shooting, while their parents were at the hospital, inconsolable after his death.\n\nI am a mother of the race. Even if he killed my baby, he\u2019s still my baby Mary Norwood\n\nNorwood said the trio of kids \u201chad more energy than the law allows\u201d and were known in the neighborhood as the \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d because they would greet new neighbors and share what they learned with the rest of the neighborhood. \u201cHe was a spunky little boy, he was so outgoing.\u201d\n\nNorwood fears for the man responsible for Xavier\u2019s death. \u201cI am a mother of the race,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if he killed my baby, he\u2019s still my baby.\u201d\n\nShe is worried that if the assailant goes to prison, he will be put on a path of more destruction and suffering. \u201cIf nothing came out of Xavier\u2019s death except the young man was able to look and see the error of his ways and that changed him in some kind of way, then Xavier\u2019s death wasn\u2019t in vain,\u201d Norwood said.", "description": "Xavier Usanga, seven, was killed outside his home \u2013 and as one of 13 children fatally shot in St Louis, Missouri, in six months, his story is grimly familiar", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch", "Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de620c68c3dac5ac0cb1b67dc4d079c0c5f1b5c4/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15c9dcbe58a744c57ef003480ac88238", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
