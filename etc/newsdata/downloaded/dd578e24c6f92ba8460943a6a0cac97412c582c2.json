The actress looks completely chic in the snap, with everything from her trademark hair to her subtle makeup captured perfectly.\n\nHowever, in the \"before\" snap, Aniston's makeup artist and hairstylist go to work, while the star pulls a pretty \"fed up\" expression. Her fluffy socks and chunky sandals, which obviously aren't visible in the finished photo, only add to her comical pose.\n\nAniston wants to make it clear that the reality of a glamorous photo shoot is often a totally different story. Referencing Notting Hill, Aniston wrote, \"I'm just a girl....standing with hair and makeup. A stylist. A photographer. A lighting crew, wind machine, props, and a computer .... asking you to think I woke up like this. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude11\"\n\nHaving already provided us with the Friends reunion we so longed for, Aniston has made it clear that her Instagram account is what the world has been missing.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The finished photo cropped out her fluffy socks and chunky sandals. \ud83d\ude02", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UoQ0T6ug6lbeYzgpq2aVLA--~B/aD0zNzY7dz03NTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/354eb8c3f8d388366ac5b69200020e27", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
