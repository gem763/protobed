Although the VAR check ruled the strike legitimate, the big screen indicated \u201cno goal\u201d before it was corrected.\n\n\u201cI was sure it didn\u2019t hit my hand but then you start thinking did it?,\u201d said Alli. \u201cI tried to make sure it didn\u2019t touch it so I could get the strike away.\n\nWatford felt they should have had an earlier penalty but, in common with most other instances in the league this season, VAR refused to overrule the referee, who indicated that Gerard Deulofeu had not been fouled by Jan Vertonghen.\n\nAt the King Power Stadium, Leicester moved third, two points behind City, in a game where technology also proved decisive.\n\nDYCHE FURIOUS\n\nBurnley\u2019s Chris Wood was denied a second goal when he was adjudged to have fouled Jonny Evans in the build-up, a decision that left Burnley manager Sean Dyche furious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of VAR but it has to be used more wisely than that,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir defender is never going to get that in a million years. There was a touch, but there is no intention in the touch and his gait doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nAt Molineux, Raul Jimenez put the ball into the back of the net three times before having a goal count after two first-half efforts were disallowed. But his persistence eventually paid off as Wolves cancelled out Danny Ings\u2019s opener for Southampton.\n\nAsked about VAR, Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo said: \u201cIt is what it is. I hope it gets better.\u201d\n\nMatt Targett\u2019s late winner helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat 10-man Brighton 2-1 as Dean Smith celebrated his one-year anniversary in charge. Technology was involved once again, with Conor Hourihane having an early strike ruled out for Villa.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lost and scratching my head with the whole system,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPressure eased on Everton manager Marco Silva after overseeing a much-improved performance against West Ham. Excellent goals from Bernard and Gylfi Sigurdsson ended Everton\u2019s run of four consecutive defeats and moved them out of the relegation zone.\n\nAt Stamford Bridge, Marcos Alonso\u2019s second-half strike gave Chelsea the narrowest of wins over Newcastle \u2014 their fifth in succession in all competitions \u2014 to move them fourth.", "description": "Manchester City kept up their pursuit of leaders Liverpool with a routine 2-0 win at Crystal Palace on a day when VAR stole the Premier League headlines with a series of decisions that left supporters baffled and managers incensed.", "authors": ["Neil Robinson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442749522&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0J0", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
