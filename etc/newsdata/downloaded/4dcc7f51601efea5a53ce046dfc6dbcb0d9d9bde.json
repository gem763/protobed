The stock rallied about 10% on August 15 as GE forcefully rebutted Markopolos\u2019 financial fraud claims and CEO Larry Culp disclosed he bought $2 million worth of stock in a show of support.\n\nSince August 16, GE\u2019s stock has lost roughly 3.3%, badly lagging the 2.1% gains for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).\n\nAs far as reading the market\u2019s tea leaves goes, it\u2019s unclear who to believe at this point.\n\nThe financial fraud allegations\n\nIn a scathing new 170-plus page research report, financial fraud expert and chartered financial analyst (CFA) Markopolos alleges GE is committing accounting fraud.\n\nMarkopolos \u2014 whose research on GE is allegedly being used by a hedge fund that reportedly shorts the industrial giant\u2019s stock \u2014dubs the company \u201cGEnron.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe I have a few smoking guns on GE,\u201d Markopolos told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round, adding that information was held back from the report for law enforcement. He added that it took seven and half months to complete the report and it was \u201cself-funded.\u201d\n\nMarkopolos said the next chapter for GE is Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSeveral allegations from Markopolos\u2019 report includes:\n\nGE has committed a $38 billion fraud primarily by hiding losses.\n\nGE will not be cash flow positive by 2021 as executives have suggested.\n\nGE is not liquid right now.\n\nA recession could tip GE into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBacklash from assorted GE loyalists quickly emerged.\n\nGE\u2019s charm defensive\n\nThe logo for General Electric appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Aug. 16, 2019. General Electric rebounded 6.7% after reporting late Thursday that its CEO had bought 250,000 shares of GE stock. GE had taken a plunge on new concerns about its accounting practices.

Our team remains confident in our company\u2019s long-term strengths; in addition to the executive and director stock purchases I mentioned last week, GE Gas Power CEO Scott Strazik also purchased another 34,836 shares on Thursday.\u201d\n\nThe same day another GE friend emerged to downplay Markopolos\u2019 findings.\n\n\u201cMost everything that was alleged has already been discussed internally and externally,\u201d former GE Vice Chairman Bob Wright said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker. \u201cIt was like bringing out old laundry and getting it out there as if nobody knew what it was. They did a twist on it. They made it seem like it was fraudulent. They made it seem like it was illegal.\u201d\n\nBut despite the charm offensive, GE\u2019s stock has still underperformed following Markopolos\u2019 research.\n\nMeanwhile Wall Street \u2014 likely fearing a loss of access to GE\u2019s top brass \u2014 mostly came out in defense of GE. One very prominent GE analyst Yahoo Finance talked with, however, remains concerned about the company\u2019s financials and the stock\u2019s outlook.\n\nWith a source telling Yahoo Finance that Markopolos has a response coming soon to GE\u2019s rebuttals, this firestorm is unlikely to die out anytime soon.\n\nGE has repeatedly declined to make anyone from its C-suite or board of directors available to Yahoo Finance for an interview. Instead it has pointed to various statements made by Culp and other executives.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
