But he said the firms do support the long-standing principle that the federal government has the \u201csole purview\u201d for setting national standards.\n\nUltimately, he said, what the group wants is for California and the federal government to forge a compromise on one national set of fuel-economy standards -- a compromise that so far has been nowhere in sight.\n\n\u201cWe think the evidence supports a middle ground ... We want a unified program that includes California,\u201d Bozzella told reporters in a call Monday, adding that the coalition supports year-over-year improvements in mileage standards. \"All of the parties involved in this know our position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said the decision to intervene in the contentious legal fight \"is about how the standard should be applied, not what the standard should be. By participating we ensure the concerns of consumers, autoworkers, retailers, and manufacturers are heard in this dispute.\u201d\n\nThe group of international auto manufacturers includes Nissan, Subaru and Hyundai. But one member, Honda, issued a statement dissenting from the decision.\n\n\u201cHonda is not a participant in this litigation, and is not contributing any funds supporting our trade association\u2019s activity in this area,\" the company said, noting it has already \u201clocked in\u201d mileage standards through Model Year 2026. \u201cWe have been very clear on wanting to avoid lengthy and costly litigation on this issue, which will result in a great deal of regulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe latest development comes three months after four major automakers -- Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America -- struck a deal with California to produce increasingly fuel-efficient fleets, undercutting one of the Trump administration\u2019s most aggressive climate policy rollbacks.\n\nThat compromise between the four companies and the California Air Resources Board came after weeks of secret negotiations. At the time, California\u2019s top air pollution regulator, Mary Nichols, said the agreement would give automakers flexibility in meeting emissions goals without the \u201cmassive backsliding\u201d contained in the White House proposal. She said she hoped the Trump administration and other automakers would embrace the terms of the deal, but that has yet to happen.\n\nThe four automakers, which represent roughly 30 percent of the U.S. auto market, said their decision to hash out a deal with California was driven by a need for predictability, as well as desires to reduce compliance costs, keep vehicles affordable for customers and be good environmental stewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement Monday, Nichols said the state would not reverse course.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the Association of Global Automakers for hiding behind the Trump administration\u2019s skirts and its assault on public health,\" she said. \"California will continue to carry out our mandate to meet national air quality standards and keep working with those automakers committed to a framework that delivers cleaner vehicles that benefit consumers and the environment.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201csingle national standard\u201d that auto companies have said they yearn for has shown little sign of becoming a reality, as administration officials and California leaders have abandoned talks and instead traded insults over the course of this year.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration is working on finalizing its regulatory rollback, which would freeze mileage requirements for cars and light trucks at about 37 miles per gallon on average, rather than raising them over time to about 51 mpg for 2025 models \u2014 the level the industry and government agreed to during the Obama era. The proposal also would revoke California\u2019s long-standing authority to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act, a practice the federal government has backed for decades.\n\nAD\n\nThe transportation sector has emerged as the single-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States, and the future gas mileage of the auto fleet will have a profound effect on the nation\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nGreg Dotson, a professor at the University of Oregon School of Law who served as a top Democratic energy and environmental policy staffer on the House Energy and Commerce Committee from 1996 to 2014, said in an interview that the fact that auto firms are joining the federal government\u2019s side \u201cadds more firepower to it\u201d and underscores the split within the industry.\n\nAD\n\nBut Dotson added that there is ample evidence that Congress has allowed for California to set its own vehicle emissions standards even when it was clear they would affect gas mileage. And he noted that while the George W. Bush administration sought to write federal preemption of California\u2019s standards into the Energy Policy Act of 2007, both the House and Senate rejected the move.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe clear history of this law, from both the executive branch and the legislative branch, all point to the fact that California was not preempted,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on Monday blasted the decision by some automakers to side with the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo say I\u2019m disappointed is an understatement, especially given the number of times these companies have told me personally that they wish to avoid costly litigation and regulatory uncertainty,\" Carper said in a statement. \u201cBy aligning themselves with this administration\u2019s reckless and illegal proposal, these companies are actively challenging the rights of states to set their own emissions standards and tackle the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "GM, Toyota and Chrysler side with White House in fight with California over fuel standards, exposing auto industry split", "authors": ["Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2FYcyh_sdtdKGipoyUuy42zlesM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QO2SYDUIXYI6THLT4K5GXPY3TM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
