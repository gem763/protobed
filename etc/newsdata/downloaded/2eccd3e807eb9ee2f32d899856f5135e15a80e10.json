Just a few days before the trip, Grace took note of her stepfather\u2019s \u201cpretty serious\u201d snoring problem, and felt badly for any poor soul unlucky enough to wind up sitting next to Tattersall on the plane.\n\n\"I'd heard of moms giving out little care packages when they have babies on planes \u2014 acknowledging that their infants might be crying,\u201d Grace explained.\n\nTogether with the help of Tattersall\u2019s wife, Ros, and a friend, Grace went out and purchased chocolates and earplugs, and sealed up 10 tiny care packages for Tattersall to hand out on the plane.\n\nAlong with the offerings, Grace and Ros included notes preemptively apologizing for Tattersall\u2019s snoring.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cEnjoy your trip today,\u201d the note begins. \u201cWe thought you might be in need of a little assistance if Alan falls asleep \u2014 so hope this little care package helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cP.S.: The snoring usually only lasts a short time \u2014 while he falls asleep.\u201d\n\nTattersall himself had no idea Grace and Ros were preparing the bags until they accompanied him to the Melbourne airport for his trip, at which point they handed them over and told him to pass them out.\n\nTattersall did as he was told \u2013 or at least he attempted to.
