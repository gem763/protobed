Yes, we know, it's the worst question.\n\nEven the less-specific questions \u2014 What are your strengths? What are your passions? \u2014 can be daunting.\n\nExplore Life Kit This story comes from Life Kit, NPR's family of podcasts to help make life better \u2014 covering everything from exercise to raising kids to making friends. For more, sign up for the newsletter and follow @NPRLifeKit on Twitter.\n\nBut finding a job after college, or finding a new job \u2014 or changing a career \u2014 doesn't have to be scary. It can actually be exciting.\n\nThese tips will help you reflect on your story: what you like, what you've done so far, and what you need to do to go out and get a job \u2014 and maybe even a career.\n\nStart early.\n\nMost campuses have a career service office staffed with advisors to help you. But so many students wait until their junior or senior year to wander in. Don't wait!\n\nWhat you decide to do professionally can be completely different from what you studied in college, so thinking about your career early in college can allow you to meander a bit, to ask yourself, \"What do I like? What brings me joy?\"\n\n\"If you're just starting to examine those questions 60 days before graduation, that's a pretty rapid timeline to cover a lot of ground,\" says Mark Peltz, head of the career center at Grinnell College, in Iowa.\n\nPerhaps you're now thinking: \"Oh, SNAP! I'm too late\" \u2014 don't worry. It's better now than never. You're reading this story, aren't you? You're already on your way.\n\nStudy yourself, using your own life as data.\n\nYou don't have to guess when it comes to what you enjoy: Observe yourself and gather insights.\n\nDon't just sit on the couch and think about yourself, go watch yourself actually do stuff, says Dave Evans, a professor at Stanford University and the author of the book Designing Your Life. He recommends making a \"good-time journal,\" a daily record of all your activities, annotated with notes on how engaging each was and whether it gave you energy or drained you. This becomes the data that informs what you like to do \u2014 and the insights you gleen go far beyond the subjects you've liked in school\n\nYou can do this log more than once: when you have a heavy course load, between semesters or during a summer job, or if you're stuck in a job that's not satisfying. Figuring out what you want to do is an ever-evolving process.\n\nDo your homework and research, research, research.\n\nNow that you know more about you, turn your focus outward to discover and learn about jobs out in the world.\n\nDon't stop at reading about them \u2014 go try out your interests, through job-shadowing, a lecture on campus, a small project, a hands-on class. Instead of crafting a to-do list, Peltz encourages Grinnell students to develop a \"try-stuff\" list to test their ideas, gather more info, and clarify what they want to do\n\nTell your own story.\n\nEven a part-time job in retail, a volunteer post or a club membership can translate into real skills, like problem-solving, leading a team, working with customers.\n\n\"You have more experience than you think, but it's about reframing that in the right language,\" says Stacey Harris of Year Up, a program that helps get community college students ready for internships and careers.\n\nAnother important way to tell your story: the elevator pitch \u2014 a mini-story that tells who you are and what you want to do (in the time it takes to ride from one floor to another). Your pitch should include your name, your history and your goals. Practice telling this story \u2014 maybe to a friend or family member \u2014 until it becomes natural.\n\n\"A couple of my students have actually hopped into an elevator with me just to practice their elevator pitch as if I was a stranger,\" Harris says.\n\nIt can be a little weird to talk about yourself. Perhaps you're thinking, \"Who am I? I don't have a story!\" But everyone has a story \u2014 and more importantly, most humans love hearing stories.\n\nLook to the future and hit send.\n\nTake your research to the next level: Find people in the world doing interesting things and do as many informational interviews with them as you can. These are informal conversations in which you ask people about their jobs and how they arrived at them.\n\nThese interviews might seem scary, but keep in mind that people love to talk about themselves and what they're doing, and they also love to help.\n\nRemember: \"You're not asking them for money. You're not asking them for a job. You're asking for the story,\" explains Evans. \"If you're genuinely interested, if you can bring genuine curiosity, go for it.\"\n\nSome things to keep in mind when reaching out: Be specific. You don't want to blanket-email a bunch of people just because you can. Think about what you're trying to get from each person you talk to: Is it the path to where they are now? Is it information about a posted job?\n\nOnce you get one interview, Evans says, go out and talk to more people. One easy way to do this is to make your last question, \"Who else should I talk to?\"\n\nAfter you've taken up other folks' time, it's best to send a thank-you note. Handwritten is lovely, but not necessary; an email will work, too.\n\nStudy up on business etiquette.\n\nThere are lots of different workplaces with lots of different rules. Since you won't know those nuances until you spend time in the office, it's best to proceed with caution. Make sure your social media channels are public-ready, and polish up your email skills. Here are some of Harris's tips:\n\nMake sure you have a professional email address \u2014 say goodbye to \"Bubblegum123.\"\n\nCraft an email subject line carefully: Write a short summary of what's in the email.\n\nBegin the message with a greeting.\n\nEnd with a signature and include a way to reach you.\n\nBeware of spelling errors, and capitalize properly.\n\nHave a neighbor or a niece who's thinking about a career?
