In particular, there are growing fears that Israel\u2019s archenemy Iran could be emboldened by what appears to be an increasingly hands-off American policy in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis had thought of Trump as a special U.S. leader very much in tune with their view of the region,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, who was former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Israel. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming to terms with the cold hard reality that his isolationist instincts and his chaotic, impulsive decision making can actually be very damaging to their interests.\u201d\n\nIt is a surprising turn of events for Netanyahu, who has been one of Trump\u2019s strongest supporters on the international stage.\n\nThat alliance yielded a wealth of dividends for Netanyahu during the first few years of the Trump administration \u2014 perhaps none so striking as Trump\u2019s decision to break with decades of U.S. policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. He moved the American Embassy to the contested holy city, enraging the Palestinians.\n\nTrump also withdrew from the international nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 an agreement that Israel had derided as weak and ineffective. He defended Israel from its many critics at the United Nations, and, early this year, recognized Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nNetanyahu routinely boasts that Trump is the best friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. But things have begun to change since he failed to win reelection in April and was forced to hold a second, inconclusive vote last month.\n\nDuring the first campaign for the April race, Trump embraced Netanyahu\u2019s candidacy and made little secret of his support, inviting the Israeli leader to the White House when he announced his recognition of the Golan Heights annexation.\n\nBut during the do-over race, Trump kept his distance. And after Netanyahu last month failed for a second time to win a parliamentary majority in national elections, Trump appeared to play down the friendship. \u201cOur relations are with Israel, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.\n\nConcerns have only deepened following a series of moves in which Trump backed away from possible military confrontations. In June, he called off a planned attack against Iran in response to the shooting down of an American drone. Trump also decided against military action in response to an alleged Iranian attack on Saudi oil facilities last month, saying he did not want war.\n\nThen, this week, he abruptly withdrew U.S. troops from Kurdish areas in northeastern Syria, clearing the way for a Turkish invasion aimed at crushing the Kurds, America\u2019s allies in the fight against the Islamic State group. Trump has defended the move by saying the United States should not be \u201cfighting and policing\u201d in the Middle East. But it reportedly caught Israeli officials off guard.\n\nThe fear is that Trump\u2019s actions, or lack thereof, could encourage Iran to step up what Israel sees as aggressive and hostile activity in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe main image is a very weak U.S. that does not help its allies. It deserts its allies,\u201d said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University.\n\nIsraeli officials declined to comment about Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria but said relations with the U.S. remain strong and the country is more than capable of defending itself.\n\n\u201cWe will always remember and implement the basic rule that has guided us: Israel will defend itself, by itself, against any threat,\u201d Netanyahu said at a memorial ceremony Thursday for soldiers killed in the 1973 Mideast war. \u201cThe Israeli military is prepared to preempt any threat, defensively and offensively, with crushing strength.\u201d\n\nBut while officials have stopped short of openly criticizing Trump, the American pullback from Syria has pushed some to question Netanyahu\u2019s close alliance. That support has had the effect of alienating some of Israel\u2019s traditional backers in the Democratic Party and the overwhelmingly liberal Jewish American community and caused friction with allies in Europe.\n\n\u201cFrom Jerusalem\u2019s perspective, it is another warning sign that this president \u2014 until recently presented as Israel\u2019s greatest friend ever in Washington \u2014 can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Amos Harel, a commentator in the Haaretz daily. \u201cAgain, one must wonder whether too much reliance hadn\u2019t been placed on Trump, at the cost of Netanyahu distancing himself far from the Democrats and undermining traditional bipartisan support in Washington for Israel.\u201d\n\nOfer Shelach, a lawmaker with the Blue and White Party, the main rival of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, said the events in northeastern Syria are \u201cmore evidence of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing diplomatic failure.\u201d He said that despite the close ties with Netanyahu, Trump does \u201cwhat suits him.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone views the U.S. move as necessarily bad for Israel \u2014 or all that new. Yaakov Amidror, Netanyahu\u2019s former national security adviser, said Trump\u2019s disengagement in many ways continues Obama\u2019s reluctance to become embroiled in yet another Mideast conflict.\n\nAlthough a U.S. exit from the region could have \u201cvery bad consequences\u201d in terms of Iranian actions, he said it also could create new opportunities. Not having to worry about the \u201csensitivities\u201d of U.S. troops in the area could give Israel more freedom to act, he said.\n\n\u201cThe space is more opened to not just the Iranians but to us,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Patricia Nieberg contributed to this report.", "description": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 For the past three years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has bet heavily on President Donald Trump and been rewarded with major", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/ee9198_israel-trump-18212-donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-in-25-2019-file-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
