These companies match people who want good investment returns directly with borrowers in need of loans.\n\nBut amid reports of a creeping fall in standards, the UK\u2019s financial regulator is now seeking to tighten its grip with its first major clampdown since taking charge of the sector five years ago.\n\nBusinesses have just seven weeks to get their act together as the Financial Conduct Authority introduces a new set of rules to protect investors \u2013 including capping how much they can invest.\n\nBonanza: Funding Circle founder Samir Desai made \u00a34million from the float\n\nThis squeeze on the industry comes in the wake of:\n\n- Nearly \u00a34 billion being loaned by investors in the UK in the space of 12 months;\n\n- Investors complaining they did not understand the peer-to-peer arrangement they entered;\n\n- Complaints of much lower returns than were advertised;\n\n- Investors with one big provider \u2013 Funding Circle \u2013 suffering long delays to withdraw money;\n\n- Two platform failures within 14 months, while others have disappeared from the market, been swallowed up by a rival or changed their business model entirely.\n\nWhat is peer-to-peer?\n\nThese companies match investors seeking good returns with borrowers in need of loans.\n\nDozens exist, lending money to individuals and small businesses while taking deposits from people who can start investing with modest sums as low as \u00a35 \u2013 though a \u00a31,000 minimum is more typical.\n\nSince the 2008 recession their popularity has grown rapidly among savers wanting above-inflation returns but without the volatility of investing in stock markets.There are now 275,000 lenders with funds in peer-to-peer platforms.\n\nWhat is peer-to-peer? These companies match investors seeking good returns with borrowers in need of loans\n\nBorrowers in turn have been lured by competitive loan rates, the flexibility to overpay without charges in some cases and modern online dashboards to keep track of repayments.\n\nPeer-to-peer quickly changed from a niche idea for the few to a popular salvation for income-starved middle England.\n\nIt seemed a win-win for hundreds of thousands of people. So much so that investors have cumulatively loaned more than \u00a317billion in the UK. Nearly \u00a34billion of that sum has been loaned out in the last year, according to Brismo which provides lending performance data.\n\nWho are the big players?\n\nThe most well-known and used names in the industry are Zopa, RateSetter, Funding Circle, Lending Works and Assetz Capital \u2013 though there are many more.\n\nZopa and Lending Works distribute investor money to individuals in want of a personal loan; Funding Circle lends to small business; while RateSetter lends to both individual and business borrowers. Assetz Capital lends to small businesses and property developers.\n\nFunding Circle was floated on the London Stock Exchange last October \u2013 helping its co-founder and boss Samir Desai make \u00a34million last year. In terms of money invested, Zopa is the largest peer-to-peer firm. Its existence precedes the crash of 2008 and investors have loaned \u00a3850million through the platform in the last year.\n\nIn 2017, the company ditched its safety net scheme designed to restore investor losses if borrowers defaulted on repayments. But Ratesetter and Assetz Capital still maintain \u2018Provision Funds\u2019 to compensate investors at risk of loss. Some of the interest repaid by borrowers on their loans is siphoned off to replenish the funds.\n\nWhy the worry over lenders?\n\nLast year, Manchester-based peer-to-peer provider Collateral went into administration after it was found to be operating without regulatory authorisation. In May this year, property finance provider Lendy failed.\n\nClients waiting for their money back will likely have access to the \u00a311million currently frozen in accounts by the end of this month.\n\nLarge sums of money are funnelled into peer-to-peer, but complaints are also emerging over proper disclosure of risk, the true rates of return that can be expected and access to money when it is demanded.\n\nThe regulator has long had concerns over misleading financial promotions in the peer-to-peer market \u2013 with some providers having overstated the returns and underplayed the risks. In particular, when companies do not make it clear that rates of return are a \u2018target return\u2019 not a guaranteed one.\n\nThis is particularly important given a recorded slide in average returns across the major providers \u2013 steadily falling over two years and from a peak in 2011.\n\nConcerns: The regulator has long had concerns over misleading financial promotions in the peer-to-peer market\n\nYields on loan-based investing are generally favourable \u2013 about 7 per cent according to recent figures \u2013 compared to UK Government bonds (currently 0.5 per cent on five-year offerings, for example), but people handing over their money do not always fully understand the deal they have entered.\n\nRupert Taylor, of Brismo, argues the need for a standard way for investors to compare providers. He says: \u2018Loans can be a great new asset class, but it has got to be easier for investors to understand what\u2019s going on.\u2019\n\nMartyn James, of online consumer complaints service Resolver, says investor complaints he has seen focus on fees and charges, higher levels of risk, unclear or misleading advertising and confusing claims about returns.\n\n\u2018The FCA has been sending out clear warning signals about the way peer-to-peer lending has been sold to investors,\u2019 says James. \u2018As with any investment portfolio, you should spread your risk over a range of products \u2013 and always fully understand what happens if things go wrong.\u2019\n\nNeil Faulkner, of peer-to-peer research agency 4thWay, says: \u2018The vast majority of peer-to-peer investors continue to earn positive and stable returns every year. What has really caught the attention of the FCA is that investors are deficient in some essential basic knowledge about peer-to-peer lending.\u2019\n\nA strong example of this, he argues, is investors who don\u2019t take a longer-term view when they put money in \u2013 perhaps because of confusion when platforms operate a secondary market. Faulkner adds: \u2018Early exit by selling loans on to other lenders will not always be as speedy as investors hope.\u2019\n\nUnder new FCA rules investors will only be allowed to stump up 10 per cent of \u2018investable assets\u2019 in peer-to-peer deals. This is essentially one tenth of your savings and investments minus any consumer debt. Investors will also need to declare themselves on forms as \u2018restricted\u2019 or \u2018sophisticated\u2019 investors, much the same as those who invest in mini-bonds.\n\nThis action won\u2019t be required if an investor has already taken regulated advice \u2013 basically getting the green light from an informed professional to go ahead and dabble.\n\nPeer-to-peer providers will also need to up their game when it comes to providing more information to investors and what process will be followed if their platform fails. They will also need to be able to back up any claims about \u2018target returns\u2019 to show those ambitions are reasonable to advertise.", "description": "Fears are mounting over troubles with 'peer-to-peer' companies as investors report slipping returns and delays to withdrawing funds.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
