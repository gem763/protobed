On the pitch the movements of the strikers are a little bit different. I don't know if Salah will be there tomorrow.\n\n'The Manchester United system played with a five-man defence. It was a good thing for them. We have a lot of options so we will see tomorrow.'\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that game will come too soon for Salah in his recovery process. The 27-year-old appeared in high spirits in training and shared a laugh with centre-back Dejan Lovren.\n\nSalah hurt his ankle against Leicester and subsequently missed the game at Old Trafford\n\nLiverpool are preparing to play Genk in the Champions League and will fly out to Belgium\n\nMissing from the open training session were defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joel Matip.\n\nIf Salah does play against Genk then the familiar trio with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino is likely to be reunited.\n\nMazzu was full of praise for Wednesday's visitors and added: 'When a team like Liverpool take 25 points from 27 and they play like they play I think they are one of the best teams in Europe, probably the best,' he said.\n\n'Klopp makes Liverpool dangerous. We know they score easily with three, four or five strikers with a lot of speed.\n\n'They have a lot of players with maturity, they have a high press and like to play at one end of the pitch. We must be attentive.'", "description": "Mo Salah is back in Liverpool training having missed the 1-1 draw against Manchester United with an ankle injury.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/13/20034604-0-image-a-43_1571747425328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
