His performance at his confirmation hearing only deepened suspicions, and irregularities in his daughter's admission to several top schools look like an open-and-shut case.\n\nNonetheless Cho clung on stubbornly until street protests swelled into the millions, and vowed to reform the very prosecution that was investigating him and his family for corruption, malfeasance and dodgy financial dealings.\n\nCho tendered his resignation on Monday afternoon, just three hours after he held a press conference announcing plans to overhaul the state prosecution system focusing on a special investigative branch that had been criticized for being too powerful and possibly politically motivated.\n\nCho in a lachrymose statement apologized for the scandal but claimed he \"endured each day under the firm will to complete my final duty as minister to reform the prosecution.\"\n\nHe added, \"My entire family has been wrecked and it was personally very difficult and painful.\"\n\n", "description": "Cho Kuk Finally Resigns Amid Massive Protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
