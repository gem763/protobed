Formerly two separate buildings, they are now linked by a minimalist glass structure, which serves as a dining room.\n\nMore: King John\u2019s Castle Comes With a Title For Its Next Homeowner\n\nThe owners\u2014who bought the home in 2008 for \u00a31.1 million according to property records\u2014gutted both buildings when they began their three-year renovation in 2009, adding Lutron lighting and home ventilation systems, electrically operated skylights and underfloor heating throughout.\n\n\n\nThe extension into the former coach house has added useful additional living areas, which have been \u201ccleverly conceived to offer a series of free-flowing spaces across the ground floor,\u201d according to the property\u2019s brochure.\n\n\n\nThe glass-clad room has full-height sliding glass doors on either side, which connect it to its green surroundings.

A muted color palette of browns, creams and dark blue, dark-grey windows and oak chevron wooden flooring feature throughout the house.\n\n\n\nThe rectory has an elegant period look, created by its double-fronted fa\u00e7ade, double bay timber windows and tall chimney stacks. Its grand reception room with an open fireplace, library and music room are set in well-proportioned, high-ceiling rooms, with wooden panelling, which lead off the central hallway.\n\n\n\nThe Old Rectory is a \u201csuperlative space with uninterrupted light and elevated views as far reaching as the Isle of Wight,\" said James Klonaris, prime appraisals specialist at The Modern House.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Rare Whiskey Remains World\u2019s Best-Performing Luxury Asset\n\nThe gardens, which feature private courtyards and formal gardens, extend to one-third of an acre. A highlight is the lawn garden featuring a water channel, clipped hedges and pleached trees. There is also a paddock land of just under an acre, which lies opposite the property.\n\n\n\nThe house is in Michelmersh, a rural village surrounded by beautiful countryside, with extensive walking paths. The River Test flows through a landscape, which features water meadows, rolling chalk hills and ancient woodland.\n\nIt is within walking distance of two pubs and sits three miles to the north of the market town of Romney and 11 miles north of the city of Southampton.
