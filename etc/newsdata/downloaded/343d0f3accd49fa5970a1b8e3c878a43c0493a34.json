Because the city of Dallas does not recognize Columbus Day anyway. So we\u2019re not replacing it. ... So this would be an actual honoring of indigenous peoples.\"\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nThe Washington, D.C., city council passed legislation on Oct. 9 declaring Indigenous Peoples Day, according to a Tuesday tweet from D.C. Councilman David Grosso, with 10 members voting in favor of the measure compared to two who voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\n\u201cColumbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937 despite the fact that Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact that millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival in the Americas, and despite the fact that Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States,\u201d Grosso said in a statement.\n\n\u201cColumbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.\u201d\n\nAlexandria, Va.\n\nAlexandria officials voted unanimously to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day in September.\n\n\u201cRenaming Columbus Day to Indigenous People\u2019s Day would provide an opportunity to acknowledge the overlooked history of oppression and the decimation of Native Americans,\u201d the city said in a memo in September.\n\n\u201cThis would be a crucial step towards balancing the existing dominant historical narrative, which utilizes the term \u2018New World,\u2019 to refer to a land that was inhabited by Indigenous people for an estimated 12,000 years prior to Columbus\u2019 arrival in 1492,\u201d the memo adds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards (D) proclaimed Indigenous Peoples Day in September after local activist Baley Champagne, a citizen of the United Houma Nation, petitioned him for the change.\n\n\u201cIt helps recognize us. We come from a very rich culture in our country and state, but we sometimes go unnoticed. We\u2019re still here, but we\u2019re not celebrated or recognized. We go unnoticed a lot. This proclamation brings a conversation, awareness, and recognition. We still see you,\u201d Champagne told WAFB9. \u201cWe\u2019re not just in the history books.\u201d\n\nVermont\n\nVermont officially replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day in May under a measure reluctantly signed by Gov. Phil Scott (R). Scott during his tenure had already recognized the day by proclamation rather than law.\n\n\"I know it's controversial from many standpoints, from many people, but you know, it's just a day, and we'll get through it,\" Scott said of the measure, according to the Burlington Free Press. \"And we've been treating it as something different over the last couple of years through resolutions. Without any technical difficulties within the bill, I'll probably sign it.\"\n\nMichigan\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) issued a proclamation instituting Indigenous Peoples Day in the Great Lakes State on Monday.\n\n\u201cIndigenous peoples have the right to the dignity and diversity of their cultures, traditions, histories, and aspirations, which shall be appropriately reflected in education and public information,\u201d it states, citing the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples endorsed by the U.S. in 2010.\n\n\u201cStates should take effective measures, in consultation and cooperation with the indigenous peoples concerned, to combat prejudice and eliminate discrimination and to promote tolerance, understanding, and good relations among Indigenous peoples and all other segments of society,\u201d it adds.\n\nMaine\n\nGov. Janet Mills (D) signed Indigenous Peoples Day into law in the Pine Tree State in April.\n\n\u201cOur history is by no means perfect. But, for too long, it has been written and presented in a way that fails to acknowledge our shortcomings,\u201d Mills said at the time.\n\n\u201cThere is power in a name and in who we choose to honor. Today, we take another step in healing the divisions of the past, in fostering inclusiveness, in telling a fuller, deeper history, and in bringing the State and Maine\u2019s tribal communities together to build a future shaped by mutual trust and respect,\u201d she added.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham Michelle Lynn Lujan GrishamNew Mexico releases plan to provide free college to all state residents: report The Hill's Morning Report - Trump takes 2020 roadshow to New Mexico Democratic governors call on Trump, McConnell to support gun control measures MORE (D) formally removed Columbus Day from New Mexico\u2019s list of official state holidays in April and replaced it with Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nState Rep. Derrick Lente (D), the measure\u2019s sponsor, is a member of the Sandia Pueblo tribe.\n\n\u201cThis day is an act of restorative justice for our Indigenous communities, and it is a time to reflect on our understanding of our country\u2019s history, both the good and the bad. New Mexico\u2019s Nations, Tribes, and Pueblos are what truly make us the Land of Enchantment, and I look forward to the Governor signing this important bill so we can properly honor our indigenous communities,\u201d Lente said after the measure passed the legislature in March.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) signed an executive order this month at the Indian Community School in Franklin establishing Indigenous Peoples Day in the Badger State.\n\n\u201cToday, we seek to recognize and honor our state\u2019s Indigenous communities while moving beyond a dated practice that perpetuates inaccurate teachings and honors genocide,\u201d Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said, according to Native News Online.\n\n\u201cThe story of Wisconsin\u2019s Indigenous people has long been one of resistance and resilience. In the coming years, our administration will work to ensure that story evolves into one that includes respect and justice,\u201d Barnes added.\n\nReno, Nev.\n\nReno became one of the most recent cities to make the transition in October after meeting with American Indian Movement of Northern Nevada activists.\n\n\"Beatings, whippings, rapes and murders were only some of the atrocities committed by this man and his followers,\" reads an American Indian Movement of Northern Nevada petition that preceded the transition. \"With this said I propose the idea of replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People\u2019s Day in the City of Reno. Let us Unite and join the 4 States and 57 U.S Cities that have already taken part in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\"\n\nSeveral other cities and counties will also celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day for the first time this year, including: Grand Forks, N.D.; Marathon County, Wisconsin; Moorhead, Minn.; South Lake Tahoe, Calif.; Ventura County, California; and Wichita, Kan.\n\nChanging the official name of Columbus Day is still under debate in many other places, including Colorado, the state that first began celebrating the holiday in 1905. Colorado state Rep. Adrienne Benavidez (D) plans to introduce a bill changing the name for the fourth time in the next legislative session, according to Denver's local CBS affiliate.", "description": "A steady stream of states and municipalities\u00a0are replacing Columbus Day with\u00a0a celebration called Indigenous Peoples Day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/indigenous_peoples_day_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
