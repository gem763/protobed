(Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's offensive in northern Syria after the U.S. removal of troops in the region entered its sixth day, resulting in deadly clashes, shifting geopolitical alliances and questions over whether U.S. military withdrawal would revive the Islamic State terrorist group, also called ISIS, in the region. As possible U.S. sanctions on Turkey loom, here's what we know:\n\nWhat's the latest?\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that President Donald Trump ordered the full withdrawal of U.S. troops in northern Syria, a move clearing the way for President Bashar Assad's government, backed by Russia, to reestablish control over the area.\n\nAfter Trump's decision to pull back U.S. troops from the border zone, Syrian Kurdish forces struck a deal with Assad's government to help them fight off advancing Turkish forces. The United States served as the Kurds' chief ally in the battle against the Islamic State in Syria over the past five years, but Kurdish forces said they no longer could count on American allies and now rely on the government they fought to break away from. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Syrian forces moved into northern towns previously under control of U.S.-backed militants Monday.\n\nAbout 100,000 people have been displaced by Turkey's assault, according to the United Nations.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nMelissa Dalton, deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Russia has become a power broker in the region.\n\n\"They're really trying to shape that,\" she said of the deal between Assad's regime and the Kurds. \"They feel they've been able to secure a military victory in the rest of Syria, and what they really want is to be able to secure a political settlement for Syria overall, and how that positions them in the region geopolitically vis-a-vis the United States.\"\n\n'A reckless gamble':Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nHenri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University and adjunct senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the deal reached between the Kurds and Syrian forces is hardly an alliance. The Kurds sought help from Syria to protect some of their cities from Turkish advance, but they are ultimately ceding power to Assad who looks to regain control of the region his troops abandoned.\n\n\"It's more of an arrangement of convenience,\" Barkey said. \"Now the Kurdish hand has been weakened, and the Syrians can prevent some sort of governing entity from emerging in that territory.\"\n\nDalton said the deal was critical for the Kurds' survival, adding the key piece came in the form of air space protection to help combat Turkish airstrikes.\n\nTrump's critics said U.S. troops in the region stabilized the area, and removing them is likely to roil conflict and make the region more vulnerable to a resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nDalton said another major concern is Turkey's capability to manage Islamic State detainees held by Kurdish forces along the border. Throughout the course of the Syrian conflict, Ankara \"turned a blind eye\" to members of the militant group passing through its border to Syria, she said.\n\n\"They allowed this despite international pressure to take steps to shore up its border, so I do have concerns about their actual willingness to take on this mission of containing ISIS detainees,\" she said. \"I also see an issue with the Turks using Syrian Arab militias on the ground and whether they will be able to manage the ISIS detainees given their history and potential connections to extremist groups.\"\n\nAbout 100 people, including women and children affiliated with the Islamic State, escaped from a camp defended by Syrian Kurdish security forces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told Reuters, adding that there was a state of \"anarchy\" inside.\n\n\"There's real risk that as U.S. forces draw back out of harm's way that these detainees are going to break out themselves or be released in those areas,\" Dalton said. \"What's so tragic is that's five years of counterterrorism work going down the drain.\"\n\nRelatives mourn in front of the grave of Halil Yagmur who was killed in a mortar attack a day earlier in Suruc near northern Syria border, during funeral ceremony in Suruc on October 12, 2019.

This group, the People's Protection Unit, or YPG, is aligned with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought for autonomy in eastern Turkey for years. As part of that effort, the PKK carried out a wave of bombings and other attacks in Turkey.\n\nWho are the Kurds?:A Middle Eastern people with 'no friends but the mountains'\n\nThe international community and U.S. military planners regard the PKK as terrorists but not the YPG, which has been a formidable and trusted ally for the U.S.-led coalition in its attempts to root out suspected members of the Islamic State group in the area.\n\nErdogan wants to create a \"safe zone\" 30 kilometers (20 miles) across the Syrian border to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees who fled the nation's civil war and live in camps along the border.\n\nArab and Kurdish civilians flee amid Turkey's military assault on Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria on Oct. 11. (Photo: DELIL SOULEIMAN, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhy is the withdrawal of US troops considered a betrayal?\n\n\"This is going to send shock waves throughout the Middle East,\" Barkey said. \"If you're a country in the region and you look at the cavalier way the United States made decisions, you have to ask yourself about America's credibility.\"\n\nThe Kurds formed the backbone of a ground force fighting the Islamic State with U.S.-led air support that retook almost all the land seized by Islamic State fighters since 2014. The Kurds lost 11,000 troops in the fighting, and 20,000 were wounded. Their sacrifice and support led to a kinship with many U.S. troops who view the withdrawal of support as a betrayal of a dedicated ally, a U.S. official told USA TODAY last week.\n\nThe United States has about 1,000 troops across Syria, according to the U.S. State Department, but the SDF \u2013 not to mention coalition forces from Britain and France battling the remnants of the Islamic State \u2013 view U.S. participation as essential to preventing a resurgence of the terrorist group.\n\nCLOSE Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin put Turkey on notice that it could face new \"powerful sanctions\" and that the U.S. will \"shut down the Turkish economy\" if Ankara goes too far in its incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria. (Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nWhat's next?\n\nOn Twitter Monday, Trump said he would soon issue an executive order authorizing the imposition of sanctions against Turkey but did not specify when they would take effect. In a lengthy statement, Trump said he would increase steel tariffs imposed on Turkey to 50% and halt trade negotiations on a proposed $100 billion trade deal with Turkey.\n\nIn his statement, Trump said that troops withdrawing from Syria will \"now redeploy and remain in the region\" to monitor the situation and prevent a resurgence of ISIS. White House officials had previously said that the troops pulled back from the line of fire would remain in the region.\n\nForeign ministers from the European Union (EU) met in Luxembourg on Monday and condemned Turkey's assault on Syria in a statement. The EU agreed to curb weapons sales to Ankara. The move stops short of a full EU arms embargo, but member states, including Germany, France, and Finland, have imposed individual weapons embargoes over the past few days.\n\nTrump's decision regarding U.S. troops in the region drew condemnation from members of Congress, who return to Capitol Hill Tuesday and are preparing their own sanctions legislation to clamp down on Ankara and possibly implement a U.S. weapons embargo.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a statement Monday saying Turkey's offensive was \"jeopardizing years of hard-won progress in the fight against ISIS.\"\n\n\"Withdrawing American leadership from this pivotal region would not serve our nation\u2019s short-, medium-, or long-term interests. It would only make a troubling situation much worse, not only for regional partners such as Israel and Jordan but for the United States as well,\" he said.\n\nAs the Turkish offensive in Syria unfolds, Trump faces a political crisis at home in the impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine. As lawmakers joined a chorus of condemnation over his decision, Trump's actions in Syria could leave him vulnerable among some Republicans weighing impeachment.\n\nThe president is due to meet Erdogan at the White House next month.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/turkeys-syria-offensive-what-we-know-middle-east-crisis/3974498002/", "description": "Syrian Kurds have shifted their alliance to Bashar Assad's government as they fight off a Turkish offensive.", "authors": ["Courtney Subramanian", "Kim Hjelmgaard", "Tom Vanden Brook", "Published P.M.
