It\u2019s so childish\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "England, England, Julian Barnes\u2019s 1998 satire on heritage and nationhood, ends with Britain being thrown out of the EU, having been so troublesome, negotiating \u201cwith such obstinate irrationality\u201d, that it is eventually paid to leave. \u201cWhat remained incontestable was that the long-agreed goals of the nation \u2013 economic growth, political influence, military capacity and moral superiority \u2013 were now abandoned,\u201d Barnes wrote more than 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cA tiny moment of foresight,\u201d the Booker prize-winning novelist notes drily when we meet to discuss his latest book. Although he allows himself only one direct reference to \u201cBritain\u2019s deluded, masochistic departure from the European Union\u201d, in an author\u2019s note at the end, the publication of The Man in the Red Coat couldn\u2019t be more timely. An elegant mix of biography, history and art, it tells the life story of a now little-known 19th-century Paris doctor, whom he deploys as \u201ca sort of pilot fish\u201d to explore the murky waters beneath the glittering surface of the belle epoque, \u201can age of neurotic, even hysterical national anxiety, filled with political instability, crises and scandals\u201d.\n\nIn fact the germ of the book dates back to 2015, before the referendum, when the author\u2019s curiosity was piqued by a painting in the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s John Singer Sargent exhibition. While most of the portraits were of famous people, the man in the red coat was one Dr Samuel Pozzi, a gynaecologist. He was also, the label informed him, a Don Juan. \u201cWhen I first saw him I didn\u2019t think he was anything to do with us here now,\u201d Barnes says of that initial encounter with Dr Pozzi at Home, but the more he researched the period, the more unavoidable the parallels became. \u201cExtreme nationalism, nativism, antisemitism, xenophobia: they were very lurid times and we have very lurid times now.\u201d\n\nSo why not write a satire, a la England, England, or, more recently, Ian McEwan\u2019s comic Brexit parable Cockroach? \u201cI\u2019m a writer who takes time to discover what he wants to write about,\u201d he replies. \u201cSo I\u2019m very glad that my old, dear friend Ian has gone straight for it. I\u2019m not that kind of writer. I write mine in advance, you see, and then reality happens!\u201d\n\nThen why not tell the story of Pozzi and his circle \u2013 with its duels, infidelities and \u201cspectacular ending\u201d \u2013 as a novel, like the fictionalised biography of the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich in Barnes\u2019s 2016 novel The Noise of Time, or the similarly fact-based Arthur and George (2005), or even Flaubert\u2019s Parrot back in 1984? \u201cHe is known to us by a real portrait,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cI somehow felt that if I did it as a fiction it might be more ordinary, you might think these melodramatic Technicolor episodes were just invented by the writer. It is good to get back to the rigour of non-fiction occasionally.\u201d\n\nHe was intrigued by the idea of an \u201cintellectual and aesthetic shopping trip\u201d to London, on which Pozzi embarked in the summer of 1885, accompanied by Prince Edmond de Polignac and Count Robert de Montesquiou. This \u201cstrange trio\u201d \u2013 \u201ca famously heterosexual commoner alongside two aristocrats of \u2018Hellenic tendencies\u2019\u201d \u2013 were given a letter of introduction from Sargent to Henry James. \u201cThey were the big five,\u201d he says. The dandy Montesquiou owned a pet tortoise, whose shell was painted gold and studded with precious stones: with its accumulation of discrete yet interconnected narratives and sparkly details, all polished to a high Barnesian sheen, the book might have been called Montesquiou\u2019s Tortoise. \u201cIf I had 6p or a euro since Flaubert\u2019s Parrot for every time someone suggested Pushkin\u2019s Button or Tolstoy\u2019s Gerbil \u2026 \u201d Barnes smiles patiently. Or maybe not.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A gynaecologist and a Don Juan \u2026 Dr Pozzi at Home (1881) by John Singer Sargent. Photograph: Gift of the Armand Hammer Foundation. Hammer Museum, Los Angeles\n\nThis hybrid form most closely resembles Nothing to Be Frightened Of, Barnes\u2019s 2008 memoir-cum-meditation on mortality, which \u201cmoves around in the way that the brain moves around when thinking about death and family and stuff like that,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think and therefore that\u2019s how I write.\u201d It is also how he talks, his conversation full of ready quotations, answering questions with anecdotes; the wry indirectness of his writing is reflected in his slightly disconcerting habit of seeming to address an invisible third party, before turning to deliver the punchline. He is often described as \u201curbane\u201d (he winces at \u201cgentlemanly\u201d \u2013 \u201ca bit patronising\u201d): genial but gently mocking in manner, crisply dressed and carefully spoken (a self-confessed stickler, he started out as a lexicographer on the OED), he would be well cast in a le Carr\u00e9 adaptation.\n\nNothing to Be Frightened Of describes \u201cthe decent dullness\u201d of his postwar upbringing; his parents, both French teachers, moved from Leicester to Northwood, north-west London, the \u201cMetroland\u201d of his debut, shortly after he was born. Next March, it will be 40 years since the publication of that first book: he has written 13 novels \u2013 not including the four crime novels written in the 80s under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh \u2013 and been shortlisted for the Booker prize four times, winning it in 2011 for The Sense of an Ending. We have Barnes to thank for the description of the Booker as \u201cposh bingo\u201d, coined back in 1987: to treat it as such is the only way to survive being shortlisted, he says now. \u201cUntil such a time as you win ... \u201d\n\nLast Sunday marked the 11th anniversary of the death of Barnes\u2019s wife, the formidable literary agent Pat Kavanagh. \u201cI was 32 when we met, 62 when she died,\u201d he writes in Levels of Life, his devastating 2013 reckoning with grief. \u201cThe heart of my life; the life of my heart.\u201d For three decades they were an imposing presence in a London literary scene that included McEwan, Martin Amis, Kazuo Ishiguro and Salman Rushdie: a British \u201cBig Five\u201d writing at the end of the century, with their own share of spats and scandal. In the 1980s as in the 1880s, \u201cthe rich gallimaufry of fame\u201d, as Barnes writes, was predominantly male. Today, although he has good male friends, he says, \u201cI prefer women\u2019s company \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of stags head-butting, that sort of stuff.\u201d And nothing makes him cry \u201clike the women\u2019s rowing coxless pair or four or eight winning a gold medal, which I don\u2019t do with male sport.\u201d\n\nHe is a fan of football (a lifelong Leicester City supporter), Roger Federer (who lacks \u201call that strutting male bullshit\u201d), food (he wrote a column called The Pedant in the Kitchen for this paper) \u2013 and \u201cthe big F\u201d Flaubert, to whom he remains unswervingly devoted. From Metroland onwards, Barnes\u2019s work might be summed up by the title of his 1996 collection of short stories Cross Channel: anchored somewhere, as he puts it, in the sea. And The Man in the Red Coat is no exception: the adverb \u201cFrenchly\u201d popping up cheekily throughout. His fiction is famous for its cool dissection of Englishness combined with a European cerebral playfulness and, as his mother noted, rather a lot of \u201cfilth\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve written about sex in my books before,\u201d he notes drolly. But in France, where he has a loyal following and was awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2017, he is regarded as quintessentially anglais. An early interview with a French journalist reported that he walks his dog in the morning and mows his lawn in the afternoon. He doesn\u2019t have a dog, and mows his lawn \u201cwith extreme reluctance\u201d, he laughs.\n\nWhat people got up to in bed, so long as there was no violence or cruelty or lack of consent, 120 years ago \u2013 how much does it matter?\n\nThe French have \u201calways been nice to me\u201d, he says. \u201cThey just took Flaubert\u2019s Parrot on board. They were so much more welcoming than if some unheard-of French novelist had written an upside-down, semi-fictional book about Dickens.\u201d And they have been quick to claim last year\u2019s The Only Story, about a love affair between a 19-year-old graduate and a much older woman set in leafy Surrey, as their own. \u201cAha, c\u2019est comme Madame Macron!\u201d\n\nBarnes feels President Macron has been \u201cheld back by Madame Merkel\u201d in his dealings with the British government over Brexit. \u201cI think they would have gone much harder in on us. What do you expect if our prime minister is on record as having referred to the French as turds? Our former foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] said the European Union was like the Soviet Union. And the one before that, Johnson, said the EU\u2019s plans for Europe were the same as Hitler\u2019s plans for Europe. Do you expect them to cut us a good deal? So childish. And so stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are about to enter a negotiation for a trade deal that might take 10 years. They will get their money one way or another.\u201d\n\nHe despairs at the insularity of the English political elite, and finds himself in support of \u201calmost all of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s major policies\u201d: on nuclear disarmament, renationalising the railways, removing charitable status from public schools, taxing the rich.\n\nBarnes has lived in the same house in Tufnell Park, north London, since 1983; writing in the same study and on the same IBM 196c electric typewriter. He reserves his computer for journalism, nothing \u201cmore creative\u201d. But while writing Arthur and George, both his typewriter and emergency back-up broke down \u2013 his punishment for mocking its hero Conan Doyle\u2019s spiritualism, perhaps. \u201cI thought \u2018God \u2013 you are doing it!\u2019\u201d he jokes, shaking his fist at the sky. He wrote three chapters on the computer and printed them out, but \u201cit didn\u2019t sound like me\u201d. Instead of a \u201cloose, free-flowing first draft, I got a three-quarters corrected one\u201d. McEwan loves the computer\u2019s ability to cut and paste, which he sees as \u201ca reflection of the human brain. But it\u2019s not a reflection of my human brain. It\u2019s completely silent. It\u2019s inert, whereas the electric typewriter has this lovely hum and then it goes clatter clatter clatter clatter. It hums as if to say: \u2018At your leisure, but I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m ready to take dictation.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe has similarly strong feelings about listening to music while writing, a sure sign that \u201cyou haven\u2019t got any of your own music. How can you hear the rhythm of a sentence?\u201d he asks sternly. He doesn\u2019t invent characters and then ask what will happen to them, but rather: \u201cWhat should they do?\u201d \u201cMoral questions often show themselves more clearly and more immediately in sexual relationships than elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cSome might think that I let Pozzi off,\u201d he says of the doctor\u2019s reputation as an \u201cincorrigible seducer\u201d. \u201cI lay out the evidence such as I can be sure of. But what people got up to in bed, so long as there was no violence or cruelty or lack of consent, 120 years ago \u2013 how much does it matter?\u201d\n\nHe loves writing as much, if not more than ever, and gets \u201cgrumpy\u201d if he doesn\u2019t write for a few days. \u201cI enjoy the solitude of it. I always have.\u201d And it was writing that kept him sane after Kavanagh\u2019s death: \u201cAs a writer you have the advantage of being able to express lucidly terrible things that have happened. I don\u2019t say that makes it any easier to bear, but it does mean that you know what you are talking about.\u201d\n\nBarnes has thought about his own death every day since his early teens. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am.\u201d His work can be read as a lifelong disquisition on ageing, memory and the inevitability of extinction: \u201call that stuff\u201d. But at 73 he is in good spirits. Spending time with Pozzi has left him feeling upbeat, and The Man in the Red Coat isn\u2019t written in the melancholy key of many of his books. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start writing about being young and cheerful,\u201d he says.\n\nBut he is only cautiously optimistic about our current impasse: \u201cI think we have to be very ingenious. And we have to be very concordial and recognise our similarities and our weaknesses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we are very good at that.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Man in the Red Coat by Julian Barnes is published by Jonathan Cape (RRP \u00a318.99).
