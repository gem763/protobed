The diplomats then agreed to testify, despite objections from the White House and the State Department.\n\nThe officials requested to testify before House committees include:\n\nPhilip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs at the State Department, who is scheduled to appear on Oct. 23. George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state under Reeker, had dismissed right-wing media allegations against the then-ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, as baseless and took his concerns to Reeker, according to documents received by the State Department's Inspector General.\n\nSuriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, is scheduled to testify on Oct. 25. In her job, Jayanti focused on Ukraine's energy sector and the country's state-owned Naftogaz company. She likely will be asked about efforts by associates of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, or others in the administration to change the leadership of Naftogaz.\n\nActing Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on March 7, 2019. Susan Walsh\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, has also been called to testify next week. House lawmakers are interested in how and when the Pentagon learned about a White House decision to hold up the release of military assistance funds for Ukraine, and what the rationale for the delay was. Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense covering Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia and the Western Balkans, who would have overseen security assistance funding for Ukraine, is due to testify on Friday.\n\nAlexander Vindman, director of European affairs at the National Security Council, is due to appear on Oct. 24. According to testimony from Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser at the NSC, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani oversaw a \"shadow foreign policy\" on Ukraine for the president's personal political gain while shutting out the national security council staff and career diplomats.\n\nTimothy Morrison, who succeeded Hill at the NSC, is due to appear on Oct. 25. Lawmakers likely will want to hear what transpired on Ukraine after Hill stepped down from her post, and how the \"shadow\" foreign policy effort continued.", "description": "House lawmakers are focused on officials who could have more insight into how the Trump administration made decisions about Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4241126/1000x563_nbc-191017-kathryn-wheelbarger-cs-145p_3d267373e850f4ebd26002d90887ee1e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
