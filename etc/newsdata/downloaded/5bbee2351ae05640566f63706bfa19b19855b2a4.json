It will be interesting to see how his development goes.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"Having had such a meteoric rise to the England position and shoring up that no.1 spot, there\u2019s going to be a lull at some point.\n\nBut he\u2019s decent and he\u2019s a good lad. When I\u2019ve spoken to him he\u2019s very focused, which is obviously very important.\"\n\nJames did suggest however that Pickford's strengths were not being capitalised on at club level.\n\n\"He\u2019s well renowned for his distribution,\" James added. \"I always question whether his ability could be used better. His accuracy is up there with the best and I think that\u2019s sort of been used more with England in tournaments.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nJames is working as an ambassador for the Safer Gambling campaign - Bet Regret.\n\nHe said: \"This isn\u2019t an anti-gambling campaign. It\u2019s just about making punters more aware of the risks of impulsive gambling.\n\n\"It\u2019s not even about whether the bet wins or loses. It\u2019s about that actual bet that you regret.\n\n\"We want to make people aware that this is impulsive gambling and shouldn\u2019t be done.\"\n\nDavid James has teamed up with GambleAware and the Football Supporters\u2019 Association (FSA) as an ambassador for the Safer Gambling campaign \u2013 Bet Regret.
