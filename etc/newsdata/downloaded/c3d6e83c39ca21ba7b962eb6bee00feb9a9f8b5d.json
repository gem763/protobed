Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nAPAC Realty has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so investors might be curious about its 9.9% yield. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on APAC Realty!\n\nSGX:CLN Historical Dividend Yield, October 16th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. APAC Realty paid out 73% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. APAC Realty paid out 174% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. APAC Realty paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were APAC Realty to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of APAC Realty's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 150% per year over this time.\n\nWe're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nThe other half of the dividend investing equation is evaluating whether earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Over the long term, dividends need to grow at or above the rate of inflation, in order to maintain the recipient's purchasing power. Earnings have grown at around 2.4% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! Growth of 2.4% is relatively anaemic growth, which we wonder about. When a business is not growing, it often makes more sense to pay higher dividends to shareholders rather than retain the cash with no way to utilise it.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could APAC Realty Limited (SGX:CLN) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
