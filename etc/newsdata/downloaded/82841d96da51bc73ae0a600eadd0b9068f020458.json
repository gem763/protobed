sport, but also the entire match officials team, selectors and support team, who have worked so hard over the last four years, culminating in Rugby World Cup 2019.\u201d\n\nGarces will be joined by assistant referees Romain Poite and Ben O\u2019Keeffe, with New Zealander Ben Skeen appointed the television match official.\n\nWith Barnes unable to take charge of the final due to England\u2019s presence in what is set to be his final international test as an official, he has been given the duty of officiating Friday\u2019s third-place play-off between New Zealand and Wales.\n\nBarnes will be joined by Pascal Gauzere and Jaco Peyper \u2013 who returns from duty after not being considered for the semi-finals following the controversy surrounding a picture he had taken with a group of Wales fans following their quarter-final victory over France \u2013 with South African Marius Jonker named TMO.\n\nWorld Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont congratulated Garces in his appointment which he said was \u201cfully deserved\u201d, with World Rugby understood to be much happier with the standard of refereeing at the tournament since they put out a statement that criticised the officiating over the opening weekend some six weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThis has been one of the great Rugby World Cups, perhaps the greatest and there is significant excitement ahead of what promises to be an exceptional final between two former champions \u2013 England and South Africa,\u201d said Beaumont.\n\n\u201cOur match officials have played their full role in this special tournament and I would like to congratulate Jerome and the team on their appointments, which are thoroughly deserved. I would like to wish them all the best for what promises to be a very exciting finale to Rugby World Cup 2019.\u201d", "description": "Welsh referee Nigel Owens missed out on an appointment for the final weekend of the Rugby World Cup after suffering a calf injury, costing a him a second consecutive final appearance.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/09/nigel-owens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
