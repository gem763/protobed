He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, \u201cSo, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d and Giuliani responded, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, \u201cNo. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT \u2018WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,\u2019 TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES\n\n\u201cThe no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,\u201d Giuliani said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding, \u201cI corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they\u2019re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy\u2019s going on,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nHe explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were \u201cinextricably combined,\u201d so one led to the other.\n\n\u201cThis is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing, although he publicly said in the past that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, already had been facing allegations of corruption.\n\nIt was reported last week that during a July phone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani in investigating the Bidens. Trump fought back Sunday, telling reporters he \u201csaid absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nFox News' John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed to clarify what he said in a recent CNN interview about his involvement with Ukraine investigating Joe Biden's son, after the network\u2019s Chris Cuomo accused him of contradicting himself.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/RG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
