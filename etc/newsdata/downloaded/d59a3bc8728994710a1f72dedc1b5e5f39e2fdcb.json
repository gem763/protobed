And financial abuse is present in nearly all domestic abuse cases.\n\nBut financial abuse can and does occur absent of any physical violence. And it isn\u2019t strictly a millennial problem, nor is it something that happens exclusively to women. Almost 50% of men in the survey by CentSai said they experienced some form of financial abuse.\n\nRelated: Something blue, something green: what couples need to know about money before marriage\n\nRecognizing financial abuse\n\nFinancial abuse can run the gamut from subtle to egregious.\n\nIt might look like a partner who can\u2019t keep a job or pay their share of the bills. Or one who makes you feel guilty for spending your own money. But it could also be a partner who offers to handle the household finances, then gradually restricts your access to those accounts.\n\nSome other common forms of financial abuse:\n\nThey open credit cards in your name without your knowledge.\n\nThey default on accounts in your name, ruining your credit.\n\nThey make you take out loans or borrow from your family, but don\u2019t pay it back.\n\nThey hide money from you.\n\nThey refuse to let you work or try to sabotage your career.\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re being taken advantage of financially, bring it up with your partner. How they react will tell you a lot.\n\nDo they get angry? Do they shift the blame to you? Do they make you feel guilty for questioning them? Or do they apologize and take meaningful steps to remedy the situation?\n\n\u201cA good sign is if you feel like you can have that conversation and your partner is receptive to it,\u201d says Katie Hood, CEO of the One Love Foundation, a nonprofit that teaches young people how to identify and avoid abusive relationships.\n\nAlso read: Your partner\u2019s credit score reveals red flags that have nothing to do with money\n\nBut if you\u2019re avoiding these types of conversations out of fear for how your partner could react, that might be a warning sign.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is in an abusive relationship \u2026 they basically start managing their life around another person\u2019s anger and volatility,\u201d Hood says.\n\nLook for patterns\n\nFinancial abuse, like most forms of abuse, typically isn\u2019t a one-off behavior, but part of a trend that escalates over time, so it\u2019s important to look for the patterns, Hood says.\n\n\u201cI think about it like falling down a rabbit hole,\u201d Hood says. \u201cIt starts out great \u2014 you\u2019re adored. The next step is isolation \u2026 they basically pull you away from your support network and tether you to them. Then, they start the emotional abuse \u2014 manipulating you, being controlling, sabotage, calling you names, calling you crazy.\u201d\n\nHow to get help\n\nFirst, assess your risk level. If you fear for your safety call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 or TTY 800-787-3224 or contact a local hotline immediately. They can connect you with resources and help you get out of the relationship safely.\n\nIf you\u2019re not concerned for your safety, start building an exit plan.\n\nAlso see: This couple never talks about money \u2014 and they never fight about it either\n\n\u201cThe first step is to be aware. The second is to start doing some protection,\u201d says Shannon Thomas, author of \u201cExposing Financial Abuse.\u201d At this stage, it\u2019s important to not tell your abuser you\u2019re going to leave. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to folks that confronted the abuser, and the next day all the money was out of the account.\u201d\n\nInstead, get educated. Find out where your joint accounts are and how to get access to them. Bank staff can be helpful, Thomas says. It\u2019s difficult, but important, to be honest about what you suspect is going on. Remember, it\u2019s something they\u2019ve likely heard before.\n\nIf you suspect a loved one is experiencing financial abuse, express your concern without berating their partner. Point out patterns that you see and ask for their assessment.\n\n\u201cThey may get defensive. They may push back,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cBut if someone gently asks and says \u2018I\u2019m seeing this and I\u2019m concerned,\u2019 it opens the door.\u201d\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "It can and does occur even absent of any physical violence.
