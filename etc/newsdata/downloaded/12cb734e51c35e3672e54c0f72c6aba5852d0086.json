Evan Vucci/AP Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump's erratic foreign policy is diminishing the US's standing on the world stage.\n\nIn a survey of a bipartisan group of 50 former diplomats, 96% said the US has lost \"significant international influence\" under Trump.\n\nNinety-two percent of those former diplomats said America's enemies have gotten stronger during the administration.\n\nTrump's failing foreign policy was on full display during a speech to the UN in which he focused on internal issues and small grievances instead of setting out a broad vision of the future.\n\nBrett Bruen was the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat. He runs the crisis-communications agency Global Situation Room.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nI never imagined it would be this bad. Sure, there are a lot of stories these days on America's diminished stature on the world stage. President Donald Trump has provided more than his fair share of cringeworthy moments as president. Trump's speech before the United Nations General Assembly sure had a few.\n\nMore than the anecdotes or another ex-ambassador admonishing the administration, my former national-security colleagues and I felt the need to try and quantify how far the country's leading foreign-policy experts believed America's global standing had fallen.\n\nSince we work with a bunch of former diplomats at the Global Situation Room, it was relatively easy to send out a survey to a few dozen of them. The results that came back were astonishing; it would even be fair to characterize them as alarming.\n\nThe survey wasn't designed to be partisan. The people we spoke with were mostly career ambassadors and those who had held senior positions in the national-security structures of our country under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nThere were many titans of diplomacy, including the former American ambassador to NATO and president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Ambassador Cameron Hume, who had run embassies in South Africa, Indonesia, Algeria, and Sudan. Even political appointees of Republican presidents, like Ambassador John Simon, who ran our mission to the African Union and served on former President George W. Bush's National Security Council.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the experts we received responses from believed that the US had lost \"significant international influence\" under Trump's erratic and error-prone presidency. I was expecting perhaps a majority, or even the vast majority, but never did I think that 96% of those 50 senior leaders surveyed would all pretty much agree: The US is in a really bad spot as a nation.\n\nThe news only gets worse. Contrary to Trump's claims, more than 92% of those seasoned diplomatic leaders believe our adversaries have grown stronger and more influential under this administration. That's really scary.\n\nAgain, this isn't merely a plurality or a particularly partisan point of view. These are people who have seen vastly different kinds of presidents and policies. Despite Trump's splashy summits with North Korea, peculiar peace process with the Taliban, and maximum-pressure campaign on Iran, there is nearly universal agreement among those who know national security best that we are in greater danger today than at any time in recent history.\n\nTrump's UN speech is the perfect example of the shortcomings\n\nThe perfect example of the problem came in the form of Trump's performance before world leaders at the UN General Assembly. It began with a braggadocious message about increased spending on the military. Trump seems to have forgotten that the UN is the place that is all about peace and decreasing dependency on weapons.\n\nThose gathered in the grand hall were then subjected to a series of small-potatoes bilateral issues or boasts. Heads of state from Mali to Mongolia heard a lot about illegal immigration in the US. He detailed his troublesome trade war with one country, China. It was emblematic of the dissonance of Trumpian diplomacy.\n\nThe world is trying to tackle big problems, like climate change and conflicts. But the president wants to parade out his pet issues and pet peeves. The reaction to the speech was telling: Last year, the leaders laughed at Trump's speech; this year, most chose to ignore it.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss or discount the damage Trump has done. One of the messages that clearly came across in the Global Situation Room survey was the damage to the US international reputation is so significant as to have achieved nearly universal acceptance among those who have served in top diplomatic posts.\n\nThrough Twitter tantrums and silly speeches, like the one he gave in New York, Trump lost us one of our most valuable national-security assets: our country's credibility and confidence in our leadership. And if the nearly unanimous concern expressed by my former bosses and senior colleagues is any indication, that trust is not coming back anytime soon.", "description": "More than 90% of the former diplomats we talked to said Trump has hurt the US's standing on the global stage and emboldened America's enemies.", "authors": ["Brett Bruen", "Opinion Columnist"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93a2152e22af41d528af00?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
