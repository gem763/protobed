But it\u2019s not Jewish settlers picking the grapes, it\u2019s evangelical Christians.\n\nVolunteers of the U.S.-based Christian group HaYovel harvest grapes at a vineyard on the outskirts of Har Bracha settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank August 26, 2019.

REUTERS/ Ronen Zvulun\n\nThey are volunteers for the devout U.S. evangelical group HaYovel which brings Christians to help Jewish farmers in settlements that Israel has built on land that Palestinians seek for a state.\n\nEvangelicals have been a core support base for U.S. President Donald Trump since the 2016 election. Many are also staunch supporters of Israel, feeling a religious connection with the Jewish people and the Holy Land.\n\nThe West Bank holds special importance to evangelicals who see a divine hand in the modern-day return of Jews to a biblical homeland - and who call the territory by its Hebrew Old Testament name, Judea and Samaria.\n\nThe founder of HaYovel, Tommy Waller, is fond of quoting a passage from the book of Jeremiah, which reads: \u201cAgain I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel...Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria.\u201d\n\nBut that land is also at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt is the heartland of what the Palestinians see as a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nFor the Tennessee-born Waller, helping the Jewish settlers cultivate the land means taking part in the fulfilment of a prophecy. \u201cAs a Christian, as a person who believes in the bible, it was an amazing thing to get to a place where my faith was touchable,\u201d Waller said.\n\n\u201cWe share a commonality between Christianity and Judaism and that\u2019s our bible, our scripture,\u201d said Waller at a vineyard on the outskirts of Har Bracha, another settlement whose farmers his volunteers assist.\n\nANNEXATION\n\nMost of the international community regards the Israeli settlements as illegal, a view that Israel disputes.\n\nIsraeli hawks, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claim the West Bank is vital to Israel\u2019s security. Relinquishing it to the Palestinians could put large swaths of Israel under threat of militant attacks, they say. Palestinians say there can be no viable Palestinian state without it.\n\nIn the run-up to Israel\u2019s election next Tuesday, Netanyahu has renewed his pledge to annex parts of the West Bank if he wins. [L5N2615TB]\n\nIt\u2019s a position that the politically powerful U.S. evangelicals have embraced.\n\n\u201cEvangelicals believe Judea and Samaria is bible land, because it is,\u201d said Mike Evans, the Texas-based founder of \u2018Friends of Zion Museum\u2019 which sits in Jerusalem. \u201cDo we think giving up Judea and Samaria is going to bring peace? No way,\u201d said Evans, who is a member of Trump\u2019s Faith Initiative.\n\nThe prospect of annexation has alarmed the Palestinians, who fear that Netanyahu is likely to have Trump\u2019s backing.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about losing our lands,\u201d said Izzat Qadous, a retired school teacher from the Palestinian village Irak Burin, across the way from Har Bracha.\n\n\u201cThe same way they have annexed Jerusalem, they want to annex the West Bank and soon we will hear of Trump acknowledging the annexation of the West Bank.\u201d\n\nAbout 2.9 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, according to official Palestinian figures and more than 400,000 Israeli settlers live there, according to the Israeli statistics bureau.\n\nEvangelical leaders lobbied Trump earlier in his presidency for his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and his relocation of the U.S. Embassy to the holy city in 2018.\n\n\u201cHe (Trump) is rewarding moral clarity and I believe the Jewish people should be rewarded for moral clarity with recognizing more of their land,\u201d said Evans, referring to the West Bank.\n\n\u201cROCK STAR\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s administration includes evangelicals at some top positions - his vice president Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who in an interview to the Christian Broadcast Network in March said that \u201cthe Lord was at work here\u201d in respect to Trump\u2019s Israel policies.\n\nEvangelical support for Israel goes back decades, with political lobbying, fundraising and organised tours to the Holy Land. But some see the ties growing far stronger under both Trump and Netanyahu.\n\nHanan Ashrawi, a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the evangelical base \u201chas been wielding unprecedented and enormous influence within the United States for the sake of the \u201cfulfilment of the prophecy,\u201d thereby giving Israel a free hand to carry out its most hardline and destructive policies against the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nDore Gold, President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, said Netanyahu began cultivating ties with evangelicals during his first stint as prime minister in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister has a keen sense of trendlines in the U.S.,\u201d said Gold.\n\nThat effort may have paid off. \u201cBenjamin Netanyahu among the evangelicals of the world is a rock star,\u201d Evans said.\n\nCritics, however, say Netanyahu has alienated many liberal American Jews by embracing Christian conservatives. Even in Israel\u2019s settlements, the evangelicals are sometimes greeted with suspicion.\n\nSome Israelis there fear that the Christians may have a missionary agenda - seeking to convert them. Evans said his mission in life is to defend the Jewish people.\n\nOthers are nervous about some evangelical readings of the scriptures in which the Jews\u2019 return to the biblical land is instrumental in bringing about the end of the world, at which point those who do not accept Jesus Christ will not be saved.\n\n\u201cThese people are pursuing God like we\u2019re pursuing God,\u201d said Waller. \u201cObviously we have our own messianic belief, but those are future things, in the kingdom to come.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nOn the other hand, some settlers see the evangelicals as helping them out in fulfilling their own vision.\n\nNir Lavi, the owner of Har Bracha winery, says Hayovel\u2019s contribution to his business has been more than financial.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful,\u201d said Lavi. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different phase of our own journey - the Jewish people\u2019s redemption in their land.\u201d", "description": "It's harvest time in vineyards atop the hills of Shilo settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
