The winner meets the New York Yankees in the AL Championship Series starting Saturday.\n\nCole is 17-0 in 23 starts since a May 22 loss to the Chicago White Sox. He has allowed 92 hits over 154 1/3 innings during that span, striking out 241 and walking 32. That includes an outstanding outing in a 3-1 Game 2 win over the Rays, when he struck out 15, didn\u2019t walk a batter until his final one, and allowed four hits over 7 2/3 scoreless innings.\n\nTyler Glasnow starts for the Rays after taking a 6-2 loss in the opener, when he gave up two runs and four hits in 4 1/3 innings, including Jos\u00e9 Altuve\u2019s go-ahead, two-run homer in the fifth.\n\nBoth starters came up with the Pirates organization and were teammates in Pittsburgh from 2016-17.\n\nCole was the top pick in the 2011 amateur draft and was traded to Houston in January 2018 for right-handers Michael Feliz and Joe Musgrove, outfielder Jason Martin and infielder Colin Moran.\n\nGlasnow was a fifth-round selection in that same draft, and was dealt to the Rays on July 31 last year along with outfielder Austin Meadows and a player to be named (right-hander Shane Baz) for right-hander Chris Archer, who went 3-9 for Pittsburgh this year.\n\nFLYIN\u2019 HIGH\n\nSt. Louis has reached the NL Championship Series for the first time in five years after a 13-1 rout Wednesday at Atlanta in Game 5 of their Division Series. Marcell Ozuna and the Cardinals set a postseason record with 10 runs in the opening inning and handed the Braves yet another playoff heartbreak.\n\nBefore many fans had reached their seats, the Cardinals were already booking their plans for the NLCS, where they will face either the Los Angeles Dodgers or Washington Nationals in a best-of-seven set beginning Friday. Those teams were playing their own Game 5 at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe know we can beat anyone at this point,\u201d Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong said.\n\nAtlanta has lost 10 consecutive postseason rounds since the last time the team advanced 18 long years ago, tying an ignominious mark set by the Chicago Cubs between 1908 and 2003.\n\nWAITING GAME\n\nThe Yankees could be getting back a pair of injured players for the ALCS.\n\nCC Sabathia threw a bullpen Wednesday and manager Aaron Boone said the 39-year-old left-hander is feeling \u201cconsiderably better.\u201d Sabathia was replaced by left-hander Tyler Lyons on the Division Series roster, and Lyons pitched a perfect inning in the second game of the three-game sweep against Minnesota.\n\nCenter fielder Aaron Hicks, who last played on Aug. 3, has recovered from a right elbow flexor strain and returned to New York from the team\u2019s complex in Tampa, Florida.\n\nRosters are due at 10 a.m. local time the day of the opener.\n\nHANGING \u2018EM UP\n\nAtlanta catcher Brian McCann is retiring after a terrific 15-year career that included two stints with his hometown Braves. He made the announcement Wednesday following a 13-1 loss to St. Louis in the decisive Game 5 of their NL Division Series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s time,\u201d the 35-year-old said softly in a somber Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cI had a long career. Fifteen years is a long time, catching every day. I got to play in my hometown.\u201d\n\nMcCann played his first nine seasons with the Braves. Following three seasons with the New York Yankees and two with Houston, he returned to Atlanta to renew a friendship with Braves manager Brian Snitker that began in the minors.\n\nThe seven-time All-Star won a World Series title with Houston in 2017 but couldn\u2019t realize his dream of helping to bring Atlanta its second championship. He finishes with a .262 batting average, 282 home runs and 1,018 RBIs.\n\n\u201cI went to high school here, I grew up here, I got to play nine years here to start my career,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI got to play with some of my heroes growing up and coming back to play with a new generation, I\u2019d say it was a success.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Thursday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/alds_rays_astros_baseball_19534_c0-202-4839-3023_s1770x1032.jpg?23987632d3765ff45a0d06cd734e146f2536a4b1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
