They have to be able to push themselves and their weapons.\n\nStaff Sgt. Hunter Bernius, a veteran Marine Corps scout sniper who runs an advanced urban sniper training course, walked INSIDER through his most technically difficult shot: He fired a bullet into a target roughly 2,300 meters (1.4 miles, or 7,545 feet) away with a .50-caliber sniper rifle.\n\nRead more: Here's how America's top snipers take the fight to the air, firing from helicopters with deadly accuracy\n\nHunter Bernius, a Weapons Company scout sniper and native of Lufkin, Texas, taking a shooting position during field training at an undisclosed location.

Tommy Huynh\n\nThe longest confirmed kill shot was taken by a Canadian special forces sniper who shot an ISIS militant dead at 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles, in Iraq in 2017. The previous record was held by Craig Harrison, a British sniper who shot and killed a Taliban insurgent from 2,475 meters away.\n\n\"There are definitely people out there who have done amazing things,\" US Army 1st Sgt. Kevin Sipes, a veteran sniper and instructor at the sniper school at Fort Benning, Georgia, told INSIDER. \"Anything is possible.\"\n\nSnipers are trained to scout the movements of enemy forces, often from very exposed positions, and are used to target enemy leaders and pin down their forces. These dangerous missions require them to become masters of concealment, as well as very skilled sharpshooters.\n\nWhile 2,300 meters may not be a record, it is still a very hard shot to make.\n\n'Hard math'\n\nUS military snipers typically operate at ranges of 600 to 1,200 meters. At extreme ranges, the Marine is pushing their weapon past its limits. The M107 semiautomatic long-range sniper rifles used by the Marine Corps can fire accurately out to only about 2,000 meters.\n\n\"Shooting on the ground can be easy, especially when you are shooting 600 meters in or 1,000 meters in. That's almost second nature,\" Bernius said. \"But when you are extending it to the extremes, beyond the capability of the weapon system, you have all kinds of different things to consider.\"\n\nAt those longer ranges, a sniper has to rely a lot more on \"hard math\" than just shooter instinct.\n\nBernius, a Texas native who has deployed to Iraq and other locations across the Middle East, made his most technically difficult shot as a student in the advanced sniper course, a training program for Marine Corps sharpshooters who have already completed basic sniper training.\n\n\"When I came through as a student at the course I am running now, my partner and I were shooting at a target at approximately 2,300 meters,\" Bernius said. \"We did in fact hit it, but it took approximately 20 to 25 minutes of planning, thinking of everything we needed to do with calculations, with the readings.\"\n\nAt that distance, INSIDER learned, it can take the bullet roughly six to eight seconds to reach the target, meaning there is a whole lot of time for any number of external factors to affect where it lands.\n\n\"You have all kinds of considerations,\" Bernius told INSIDER, explaining that snipers have to think about \"the rotation of the Earth, which direction you are facing, wind at not just your muzzle but at 2,300 meters, at 1,000 meters, you name it.\"\n\nDirection and rotation of the Earth are considerations that most people might not realize come into play.\n\nWhich direction the sniper is facing can affect the way the sun hits the scope, possibly distorting the image inside and throwing off the shot. It also determines how the rotation of the planet affects the bullet, which may hit higher or lower depending on the sniper's position.\n\n\"This is only for extreme long-range, shots over 2,000 meters,\" Bernius said.\n\nOther possible considerations include the temperature, the humidity, the time of day, whether the sniper is shooting over a body of water (it can create a mirage), the shape of the bullet, and the spindrift of the round.\n\n\"We ended up hitting it,\" Bernius said. \"That, to me, was probably the most technically difficult shot.\"", "description": "It took him almost half an hour to plan out his most technically difficult shot, which involved hitting a target more than 25 football fields away.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5a966ecd97844eb30aab3b-1334-667.jpg"}
