This is the book the government does not want you to read.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Snowden leaked top secret documents on global surveillance programmes run by American and British spy agencies to media outlets. The Guardian and the Washington Post shared a Pulitzer prize for the story.\n\nAt the time, Donald Trump, who had not yet begun a political career in earnest, described Snowden a \u201ctraitor\u201d who gave \u201cserious information to China and Russia\u201d and who \u201cshould be executed\u201d.\n\nSnowden now lives in Moscow. In an interview with the Guardian to mark the publication of his book, he discussed a life spent communicating with supporters in the US by computer. He said he had detected a softening in public hostility.\n\n\u201cWe live in a better, freer and safer world because of the revelations of mass surveillance,\u201d he said.\n\nSnowden also said he was reconciled to life in exile. He married his partner, Lindsay Mills, in a Russian courthouse two years ago.\n\nIf the US government gets its way, they might not enjoy the proceeds of his work. In a statement, the eastern district of Virginia said: \u201cThe United States\u2019 lawsuit does not seek to stop or restrict the publication or distribution of Permanent Record.\n\n\u201cRather, under well-established supreme court precedent \u2026 the government seeks to recover all proceeds earned by Snowden because of his failure to submit his publication for pre-publication review in violation of his alleged contractual and fiduciary obligations.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also names as nominal defendants corporate entities involved in publishing Snowden\u2019s book. The US is suing the publisher, Henry Holt, solely to ensure no funds are transferred to Snowden, or at his direction, while the court resolves the claims.\n\n\u201cIntelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,\u201d said G Zachary Terwilliger, the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is separate from the criminal charges brought against Snowden, whom the government has accused of violating the Espionage Act.\n\nIn his Guardian interview, he neither confirmed nor denied a detail from Oliver Stone\u2019s 2016 film Snowden, a dramatisation of his story which showed him, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, smuggling secrets on a memory card stuck to a Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\n\u201cA Rubik\u2019s cube can be very useful and functions as a distraction device and also functions as a concealment device,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also discussed life as an NSA contractor, saying that in 21st century intelligence agencies, \u201cthere are no James Bonds\u201d.\n\nReviewing Snowden\u2019s book, which also contains excerpts from a diary kept by Mills, the Guardian head of investigations, Nick Hopkins, wrote: \u201cHis account of the experiences that led him to take momentous decisions, along with the details he gives of his family background, serve as a robust defence against accusations that he is a traitor.\n\n\u201cIt also offers a reminder that his disclosures of mass surveillance and bulk collection of personal information are as relevant now as they were in 2013. More so, he argues, given that private companies have become the new data behemoths.\u201d\n\nThe government lawsuit was condemned by the American Civil Liberties Union. Ben Wizner, director of its speech, privacy, and technology project and a lawyer for Snowden, said: \u201cThis book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organisations.\n\n\u201cHad Mr Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review. But the government continues to insist that facts that are known and discussed throughout the world are still somehow classified.\u201d\n\nJesselyn Radack, a lawyer who represents whistleblowers, drew a parallel with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, tweeting: \u201cIn both [cases] we\u2019re seeing a toxic new trend of [the justice department] going after PUBLISHERS.\u201d\n\nThe government may rest its case on the precedent of Frank Snepp, a former CIA analyst who in 1977 published a book, Decent Interval, about the agency\u2019s role in the Vietnam war.\n\nThe government sued him for breach of contract and a federal court imposed a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on proceeds from the book, later reimposed by the supreme court.\n\nFrancis Boyle, an international law professor at the University of Illinois College of Law who believes Snowden performed a vital public service, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he should be penalised for it financially but, regrettably, that\u2019s the Snepp case and now the supreme court is even more rightwing, so I think he will lose his proceeds.\u201d", "description": "Suit contends whistleblower published Permanent Record \u2018in violation of non-disclosure agreements\u2019 with both CIA and NSA", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1f5b4ae4b6d4bc9e4b1805f71b24c7eb707cb0/135_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=887295661c3b3de2ad8fdd71370f5f45", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
