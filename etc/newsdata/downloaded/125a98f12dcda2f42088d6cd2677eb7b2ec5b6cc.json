The Bears only made this tournament courtesy of a couple of eligibility mishaps from other European nations, and there is a sense that the standard in other parts of Europe, notably Spain, Romania and Germany, may be improving to such an extent that Russia will be left behind. So, perhaps, one too savour. The Russians have had a good tournament, and have on the whole been more competitive than warm-up defeats to Jersey and Connacht suggested. I love this group of Scotland backs. George Horne and Adam Hastings take the reins in the halves, with Hastings very much in the Finn Russell mould with creative attacking play from both hand and foot, and Horne a livewire around the fringes with a superb running game. Pete Horne is a canny footballer at 12, Duncan Taylor solid as anything at 13, but it is out wide where the real excitement comes. Tommy Seymour is back in and in need of a strong performance, and he's joined by an extremely exciting young Edinburgh pair. Darcy Graham showed a little bit of what he can do against Samoa and is dynamite in open space, and Blair Kinghorn is a personal favourite, with a howitzer of a boot and a stride length to cross the Firth of Forth in three elongated bounds. Russia can't afford to kick loosely, and I'm expecting Scotland to score a few tries today. It has been a disappointing tournament for Scotland, with a woefully ineffectual opening game against Ireland and injuries to a number of key contributors. They rather ground out the bonus point win against Samoa, but never truly found their attacking flow. That will be on their to do list today, albeit with a second-choice backline. Talking of which... The 5 best tries of the Rugby World Cup so far Advertisement Meanwhile, over in Kumagaya Argentina have just wrapped up their World Cup campaign with an entertaining victory over the USA, ten tries split 7-3 in the Pumas favour. Not the tournament Mario Ledesma would have hoped for, with Argentina resigned to third place in Pool C, but a strong finish. 47-17 the full-time score. center no-repeat #999999;cursor:pointer;top:-17px; border-radius: 2px 2px 0px 0px;\">\u21b5 There's a rather large tropical storm lurking, and Jack de Menezes is on Typhoon Hagibis watch in Japan... Super typhoon threatens England and Scotland games after intensifying Team News - Russia Russia are without their two 2019 World Cup point-scorers - Kirill Golosnitskiy is out after colliding with the post padding in their defeat to Ireland, while fly-half Yury Kushnarev is dropped to the bench. Captain Vasily Artemyev continues his streak of starting every game Russia have played at a Rugby World Cup. Team News - Scotland Scotland make 14 changes from their win over Samoa, with only wing Darcy Graham retaining his place. Hooker Fraser Brown starts on the openside, something he has done only once before for his country (against Argentina last summer), while Adam Hastings starts at ten. John Barclay captains the side on the blindside. Advertisement Good morning! Pool A is shaping up as perhaps the most intriguing pool at this Rugby World Cup, with Japan's win over Ireland opening the group up, and confusion and chaos around a looming typhoon further muddying the waters. Scotland know, then, that two bonus point wins might just be enough. Russia are their penultimate opponents, and kick-off is not too far away...
