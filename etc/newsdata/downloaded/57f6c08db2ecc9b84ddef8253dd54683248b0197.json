A New York skydiving instructor who lived to fly, he was fired from his job in 2010 after telling a female customer not to worry about being strapped tightly together because he was gay.\n\nZarda died in a risky BASE jumping accident in 2014, but his intrepid nature lives on in a daring legal dispute over his termination that will be heard Tuesday by the Supreme Court.\n\nTogether with a fired child welfare services coordinator from Georgia, Zarda \u2013 represented by his sister, Melissa, and former partner, Bill Moore \u2013 contends that a 1964 federal civil rights law barring sex discrimination in the workplace should include sexual orientation. In a related case, a fired funeral home worker from Michigan who is transgender says the statute should extend to gender identity.\n\n\"Nobody should be fired ever for being who they are,\" Melissa Zarda says. \u201cI want the Supreme Court to stand by the fact that LGBT people are protected at work.\u201d\n\nDonald Zarda, seen here in his BASE jumping days, died in 2014, but his sister and former partner have taken his employment discrimination case to the Supreme Court. More\n\nThe three cases are among the most significant on the high court's 2019 docket, and the justices' rulings are likely to come in the heat of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe challenges pick up where the same-sex marriage battle left off in 2015, when the court ruled 5-4 that states cannot ban gay men or lesbians from getting married.\n\nMore: Ex-funeral home worker\u2019s case going to Supreme Court\n\n\"This is a more fundamental freedom than what was at stake in Obergefell,\" the same-sex marriage case won by James Obergefell and other LGBT plaintiffs, says Ria Tabacco Mar of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe challenge may be more difficult, however, for two reasons. The author of the high court's four major opinions expanding gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, retired last year and was succeeded by conservative Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And rather than claiming a constitutional right, the challengers must convince at least five justices that the word \"sex\" in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 incorporates sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHow the court rules may come down to the comparison justices make. In court papers, lawyers for Zarda argue that \"the relevant question ... is whether men who are attracted to men are being treated differently from women who are attracted to men.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, which lined up with the employers even though the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had been on the other side, offers a different comparison \"between a female employee in a same-sex relationship and a male employee in a same-sex relationship.\"\n\n\"They would be similarly situated,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argues in court papers, \"and they would be treated the same.\"\n\n'A nationwide issue'\n\nMelissa Zarda, seen here at her wedding with her late brother Donald, has helped bring his LGBT employment discrimination case to the Supreme Court.
