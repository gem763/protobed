Danish start-up community manager Bolette Wrestroem says quotas, while potentially a \u201cgood stepping-stone\u201d, could also suggest that \u201cwomen are only there because it is required and not because of their skills or capabilities\u201d.\n\nQuotas for board members have already been introduced on a nationwide scale in Norway and Iceland. But as The Nordic Gender Effect at Work report points out, improvements at board level have not led to a jump in the number of women CEOs or managers. \u201cOne reason for this is that the business world is characterised by a wide range of leadership standards and traits that are typically (perhaps stereotypically) associated with men,\u201d it concludes.\n\nNguyen says she has placed several women in high positions in Swedish head offices who ended up leaving because they felt they needed to adapt too much to be heard. \u201cThe most important step is creating an environment where people of different backgrounds, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, feel empowered and supported to do their best,\u201d she argues. \u201cWe cannot just hire females and minorities and expect them to figure it out.\u201d\n\nMany campaigners argue that educating male employees on the benefits of diversity should be more prominent. Numerous global studies have concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation's performance.\n\nThe chief executive of Heba, a Stockholm rental company named-and-shamed for low male-female diversity, recently made headlines for admitting he hadn\u2019t thought about the advantages of having more women managers until his top executive team achieved gender balance.\n\n\"I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind. The workplace works better because of the [gender] mix,\" Lennart Karlsson told the BBC shortly afterwards. \"The discussion climate is better, you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other.\"\n\nIn Norway, a private equity firm criticised for a lack of female managers recently introduced a policy making it mandatory for all fathers to take at least two months\u2019 parental leave, or risk losing their bonus, to help reduce unconscious bias.\n\n\u201cIf I am a female and I look at the male team members around me becoming fathers and none of them take any parental leave, I will feel that I am an outlier when I get pregnant and I need my parental leave,\u201d says Chief Operating Officer Morten Welo. \u201cSo we thought - \u2018let\u2019s turn this around\u2019, and say it\u2019s mandatory regardless of gender.\u201d\n\nHe says the policy also sends \u201can important signal\u201d that he hopes will encourage more young female graduates to consider the company. \u201cTo attract the best talent, we need better diversity.\u201d\n\nMore companies are also experimenting with digital platforms designed to help tackle unconscious biases. Tengai, the world's first robot designed to carry out unbiased job interviews, is being tested by major Swedish recruitment firm TNG. In Norway, Equality Check, a community-based platform of employee reviews rating equality in companies (similar to the English-language Glassdoor platform), has become a popular tool for both applicants and HR professionals.\n\n\u201cBig funds have also become a lot more aware of how they write job descriptions - what words you use and how do you conduct the interview processes,\u201d adds Rikke Eckhoff H\u00f8vding at the Norwegian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (NVCA). \u201cI would say no-one knows the answers, so we need to try different things, readjust and think of something new if it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "description": "Even Europe's most egalitarian countries struggle to put women on an even footing at work.
