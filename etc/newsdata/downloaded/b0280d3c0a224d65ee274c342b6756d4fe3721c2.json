But a new line was drawn on Sunday when Australia centre Kerevi was penalised for leading with his arm when confronted by the Wales outside-half Rhys Patchell.\n\nMichael Cheika's flawed selection process undoes Wallabies | Bret Harris Read more\n\nAs his opponent stood tall in bracing for contact, rather than looking to tackle the midfielder around the waist or legs, Kerevi raised his left arm to the height of Patchell\u2019s chest to prevent his head from smashing into the Welshman\u2019s right shoulder, but was warned for dangerous play. The previous week, Australia\u2019s wing Reece Hodge was cited and banned for a similar challenge to Patchell\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident was reviewed, some of the boys thought it was Rhys Patchell\u2019s challenge that was being reviewed,\u201d said Kerevi. \u201cI could not see why because it was not high and I felt fine. Then I realised they were looking at me and I was shocked. It was the first time I had been reviewed for running with the ball.\n\n\u201cI just hoped I was not going to get a card. Michael Hooper [Australia\u2019s captain] was asking how I was meant to run when I next had the ball. The referee said I could lead with my arms but not go for the neck, but that is what I had done. It just looked worse in slow motion. All I did was continue my stride. There is no way I would put my arm in someone\u2019s face, I know the rules.\n\n\u201cI respect the referee\u2019s decision and I understand the pressure they are under, and not just from the media. But is there a ruling on the way we are meant to run? Players understand that rugby is a collision sport and all we want is consistency. You would think that players would be involved in drawing up these rules and you have to understand it from our point of view.\n\n\u201cYou have a split second in which to react. I want to be physical because rugby is a tough sport. We put our bodies on the line. We know there are things you cannot do and that safety is important, but I really do not know what else I could have done in that challenge on Sunday. I might just as well avoid the contact, but that is not my game and I do not want it to become soft.\u201d\n\nKerevi said after the match that he might as well make the switch to rugby league, where thumping collisions remain a feature of the game. He is remaining in Japan after the World Cup having signed a contract with Suntory.\n\n\u201cI was joking but being serious at the same time,\u201d said the 26-year old, who was born in Fiji. \u201cThere are collisions in league and I enjoy that stuff. It is why you play. I do not think players from the Pacific Islands are being targeted in the World Cup: there are big boys of all nationalities out there. What is needed is consistency. I just want to get on with playing.\n\n\u201cThe pity in all this is that we should be talking about the amazing game between Japan and Ireland. I understand the media want juicy stories, but that game was what a World Cup is all about. It is the type of story that needs to be focused on.\u201d", "description": "The Wallabies vice-captain has called on the authorities to bring in players to advise on the regulations covering the contact area", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee38b096b1e76dddc050e2b0b9944453ced6fe3/0_85_2266_1358/master/2266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc4d837eace94206a1b00d9d7c4a5e28", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
