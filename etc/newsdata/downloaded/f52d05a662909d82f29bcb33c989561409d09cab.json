As he preps a bite that may put him \u201cin the hospital,\u201d the \u201cLiving with Yourself\u201d star says, \u201cLook at us. Hey, look at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at us,\u201d Evans responds. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Rudd sarcastically retorts.\n\nTwitter users really latched on to the short exchange and with a few clever captions made it into one snarky meme that pretty much delivers the sentiment of being surprised by accomplishing a goal.\n\nTo check out some of the best spins on it, just scroll down.\n\nMe and my bank account after I've made $50 stretch for a week and a half pic.twitter.com/OrG3eIKkjp \u2014 DJ Suge Henry (@DJJordanJetson) October 20, 2019\n\nWhen you and your boo finally decide on a place to eat pic.twitter.com/fEdlU5T8EV \u2014 Anthony Rodriguez (@saint_papii) October 21, 2019\n\nwhen u end up in a whole 2 year relationship after what was supposed to be just a hook up pic.twitter.com/cVgEI4XN3F \u2014 unity (@unitycitlali) October 21, 2019\n\nMe and my sister hanging out like normal adults after beating the shit out of each other daily throughout our entire childhood pic.twitter.com/H4WCxeXXiX \u2014 Tinderella (@ballerguy) October 22, 2019\n\nWhen divorced parents come to their child's graduation pic.twitter.com/31HJr634Zo \u2014 Scuba Gooding Jr. (@scuba718) October 22, 2019\n\nAny time I actually have sex pic.twitter.com/QivUSd5uIL \u2014 ANW Pizza Parker \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf9 (@ShowofTheColton) October 19, 2019\n\nme at 7pm: guys i\u2019m not going out again for awhile i can\u2019t afford it\n\n\n\nme at 4am talking to myself in the club bathroom mirror: pic.twitter.com/hoVelgOxHE \u2014 luke (@houlets) October 22, 2019\n\nWhen you make next morning brunch plans when you\u2019re hammered and then actually follow through with them pic.twitter.com/dWu31q0CQe \u2014 ry (@Mr__Tweeets) October 20, 2019\n\nWhen you both said \u201cno strings attached\u201d and end up catching feelings pic.twitter.com/iBVDLQBbRD \u2014 CONEJO LOCO (@FULLSENDMIGUEL) October 22, 2019\n\nme and my friends drunkenly eating McDonald\u2019s at 3am after one of us threw up, one of us lost our ID and another texted their ex pic.twitter.com/lhw8TDnZe0 \u2014 kat (@_thegreatkatsby) October 22, 2019\n\n\"Bethesda announces a monthly subscription service for Fallout 76.\"\n\n\n\nThe last two remaining people playing the game: pic.twitter.com/z0DJxVYgL9 \u2014 SHARKK (@SHARKK_TOOTH) October 23, 2019", "description": "The \u201cAnt-Man\u201d star delivers the world\u2019s most sarcastic affirmation in a funny clip from \u201cHot Ones.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db1c59c210000d428ad3cf0.png?cache=4genv0f7q9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
