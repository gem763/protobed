Is she dead?\n\nThe horror commenced as Cain discovered the truth about their affair and lured them onto the boat. When Nate boasted about his affair with Moira, Cain clubbed him over the head, leaving him for dead. He then confronted Moira, forcing her to admit the truth about her infidelity.\n\nCain was broken hearted by the truth and Moira knew that she was in danger as Cain refused to take an injured Nate back to the shore. As Moira tried to talk sense into him, Nate came round and a fight broke out between the two men.\n\nMoira was unable to intervene as Nate and Cain fought each other but as Cain raised a weapon to finish Nate off, he dropped the bombshell that he is his son. Cain was staggered but another series of events saw the subsequent scuffle knock Moira into the lake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she was submerged and fell to the bottom, she found herself tangled in the weeds on the bed of the lake. WIth her not surfacing, Cain looked on numbly while Nate cried out for her.\n\nIt was quite the cliffhanger for Emmerdale fans \u2013 while Moira\u2019s recent behaviour has certainly not gone down well with viewers, no-one wants to see the popular character die. But will Cain focus on finishing Nate off or will he dive into the water to save his wife before it\u2019s too late?\n\nThe danger is far from over as fuel has been spilled in the fracas and as the cooking below threatens to trigger a spark, an explosion will tear through the boat. And suddenly it won\u2019t just be Moira who is facing a deadly end\u2026\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Has Cain killed his own wife?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/30_09_emm_cain_nate_moira_01-f45e_1571749380.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
