A working group focused on the VVSG\u2019s cybersecurity elements reviewed the document during an Oct. 29 teleconference.\n\nAs its name suggests, the VVSG \u2014 produced by the Election Assistance Commission and the technical standards agency NIST \u2014 is not a set of mandatory federal rules. However, most states require voting equipment to pass VVSG-based testing before they buy it.\n\nSecurity experts have frequently criticized the VVSG for lacking robust protections against hacking. It has not been significantly updated since the EAC adopted the first version in 2005.\n\nWireless connectivity has been a particular concern. Some vendors offer machines with cellular modems that allow poll workers to rapidly transmit unofficial results to central offices on election night. Some election officials appreciate the modems\u2019 convenience, but experts say they create serious vulnerabilities by connecting machines to the internet.\n\nIn May, advocacy groups said that they had driven more than 50,000 public comments to the EAC urging the commission to ban wireless and internet connectivity. Dan Savickas, federal affairs manager at the conservative organization FreedomWorks, called it \u201ca commonsense measure to ensure the integrity of our voting machines.\u201d\n\nThe NIST employees drafting VVSG 2.0 ultimately agreed. \u201cExposure to the internet could allow nation-state attackers to gain remote access to the voting system,\u201d they wrote in the discussion section of the new wireless ban.\n\nEven local wireless connections such as Bluetooth \u201ccan expand the attack surface of the voting system,\u201d they wrote in explaining the separate wireless ban.\n\nBluetooth is one way for hearing-impaired voters to connect accessories they need to use in polling places. Under the new rules, which were developed in collaboration with the VVSG accessibility working group, those voters will still be able to use assistive devices by plugging in adapters.\n\nDuring the Oct. 29 cyber working group meeting, NIST staffer Gema Howell confirmed that, if this rule were approved, election officials would have to transmit results using non-voting technology, such as by taking cellphone pictures of results and emailing them to central offices.\n\nMorning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

In May, the agency\u2019s Republican chairwoman, Christy McCormick, falsely told the Senate Rules Committee that the current VVSG bans internet connectivity. Following a POLITICO inquiry, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.,) the committee\u2019s top Democrat, asked McCormick to correct the record, which she did in June.\n\nThe new rules, along with the rest of VVSG 2.0, must survive approval by three EAC advisory groups. The 15-member Technical Guidelines Development Committee will meet on Friday to review the draft. If they approve it, the EAC will then submit it to the agency\u2019s Board of Advisors, as well as its Standards Board. It remains unclear, however, whether the EAC\u2019s four politically appointed commissioners will have to vote to approve the rules after that.\n\nThe EAC also has not yet developed a plan for phasing out the old VVSG. There will likely be a transition period during which states can ask vendors to meet either the old or the new standards.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/7b/41c820af40e3813502ba6c963338/191030-voting-machines-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
