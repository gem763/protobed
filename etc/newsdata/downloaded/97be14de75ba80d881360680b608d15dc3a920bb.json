It also claimed to have \u201cdramatically improved the pace of execution and capital efficiency of new production lines\u201d.\n\nTesla shares tumble amid $408m loss and another high-profile departure Read more\n\n\u201cSuper proud of Tesla team for great execution & support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!\u201d tweeted the chief executive Elon Musk about the results.\n\nThe positive results came after Tesla lost $1.1bn during the first half of the year. That had caused many investors to lose faith in the company even as it boosted sales of its vehicles.\n\nDoubts about Tesla forced its stock to fall by 23% so far this year, while the bellwether Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has climbed 20% so far. But Tesla\u2019s shares recovered a big chunk of those losses after its third-quarter numbers came out. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had projected Tesla would lose about $253m during the third quarter.\n\nInstead, Tesla delivered a \u201cjaw dropper\u201d, said the Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. \u201cThe street wanted profitability and Tesla delivered in big fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company, such as opening Gigafactories on other continents,\u201d Musk said on an unusually restrained conference call with investors.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s erratic behavior, including his infamous tweet that he planned to take the company private and baseless allegations of pedophilia against a volunteer rescue worker, have long dogged the company and resulted in investigations and fines.\n\nDevelopment of the company\u2019s new factory in Shanghai is ahead of schedule, Musk boasted, and trial production has already begun. He said the company will announce the location for a factory in Europe before the end of the year.\n\nMusk also advanced the timeline for production of the Model Y, a crossover SUV that was first unveiled in March, to summer 2020.\n\nDespite the strong quarterly performance, Tesla will almost certainly post yet another annual loss this year, just as it has done every year since its initial public offering in 2010. Since then, Tesla has amassed more than $5.5bn in losses.\n\nMore financial potholes could still be looming on the road ahead as Tesla faces increasing competition, with more automakers rolling out their own electric vehicles to cater to the growing number of consumers looking for alternatives for fuel-burning vehicles. Many of those automakers will be able to take advantage of alluring tax incentives that are now being phased out for Tesla because of its head start in the field.\n\n\u201cWe have passed peak Tesla, it has already seen its best days,\u201d asserted David Kudla, the chief investment strategist for Mainstay Capital Management, a financial advisory firm that focuses on the auto industry.\n\nNicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, also warned of potential challenges to future demand. \u201cThe price of Teslas may be lower than in the past, but they\u2019re still a big ticket, comparatively premium product,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a category that holds up well in a downturn \u2013 and the economic landscape is hardly rosy.\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed reporting", "description": "Results come after Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company lost $1.1bn during the first half of 2018", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d00df4ad24c0a510d5c55ab6c9c758a52bc22db6/0_3_6948_4168/master/6948.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b3941c5d92a580023e3d6b1f5ebcf24", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
