Perhaps in more ways than one, although the New York Post\u2019s sources are sticking to the obvious route for now. Hirsi now plans to file for divorce, the paper reports, after allegations of an affair between the congresswoman and her political consultant went public in the latter\u2019s own divorce action.\n\nThis would be the second split between Omar and Hirsi \u2026 officially, anyway:\n\nThe Minnesota congresswoman and her husband allegedly separated in March, and Omar asked Hirsi to divorce her around that time because she didn\u2019t want to file the papers \u2014 but Hirsi refused, telling her if she wanted a divorce she should do it herself, said the source, who has known both parties for 20 years. The husband allegedly changed his mind after Tim Mynett\u2019s wife last week filed bombshell divorce papers claiming her spouse was having an affair with the Somali-born US representative \u2014 with Hirsi said to be angry he had been made to look the fool by the allegations of an extramarital affair. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t filed already,\u201d the source told The Post, adding that Hirsi was \u201cvery confused\u201d in the wake of the bombshell allegations but still loved his wife and was reluctant to expose their three children to a public divorce battle.\n\nHirsi and Omar wed in a religious ceremony \u2014 but not legally \u2014 in 2002, and then split up six years later. In 2009, she married Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, but that\u2019s where the story gets interesting. Despite her marriage to Elmi, Omar continued to file joint tax returns with Hirsi, which is illegal for unmarried couples in Minnesota. Omar later claimed that the Elmi marriage was also only a \u201cfaith tradition\u201d ceremony, but a legal civil marriage certificate exists for it. Omar moved back in with Hirsi in 2012 but didn\u2019t divorce Elmi until 2017. She married Hirsi last year, but that doesn\u2019t retroactively clear the criminal issues regarding Omar\u2019s taxes.\n\nThat might not be the only criminal risk that Omar faces if Hirsi decides to play rough in a divorce. According to Scott Johnson\u2019s sources on Omar, Hirsi might be ready to finally explain exactly who Elmi is, and why Omar might be vulnerable to an immigration-fraud prosecution:\n\nIn the past three weeks I have circled back to interview sources whom I have found to be highly reliable in the Omar saga. They open a window onto the scandals from the perspective of Ahmed Hirsi, her long-time partner and the father of her three children. According to sources, Hirsi is telling friends: \u2022 that he will not go to jail for Omar; \u2022 that while Omar did indeed marry her brother (Ahmed Elmi) for fraudulent purposes, Hirsi did not know at the time that she had married Elmi; \u2022 that Omar is threatening Hirsi he would be in trouble along with her if the truth were to come out; \u2022 that Omar has asked him to state publicly that all is well with their marriage even though it is completely done and finished; and \u2022 that in fact they are living apart and have been divorced under Islamic law (although they remain legally married). Having humiliated Ahmed Hirsi by her affair with Tim Mynett, Omar now wants Hirsi to perform public relations services for her to suppress the scandal. That is cold.\n\nAssuming this is all true, Hirsi faces two big problems in this mess. He filed those taxes along with Omar. That makes him just as vulnerable to prosecution over the fraudulent claim of joint filing status. If he knew that Omar had married her brother to fraudulently provide him legal status in the US, he could be charged as an accessory. If Scott\u2019s sources are accurate, Hirsi needs good legal representation and a willingness to cut a deal.\n\nOmar, however, has far more headaches ahead of her if this is all true. Prosecutors won\u2019t be looking to cut a deal with her, after all, and she can\u2019t afford to take one even if they were. Her political career would come to a screeching halt if she admitted to tax and immigration fraud; even in Minnesota\u2019s extreme-liberal 5th congressional district, that\u2019s a few bridges too far. Minneapolis has other up-and-comers who can replace Omar, and likely provide a lot less embarrassment for her district, too.\n\nJust how true is it? The court filings will give us some clue, but Omar\u2019s political adviser is denying the affair in his:\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s alleged lover Tim Mynett has denied bombshell allegations that he left his wife for the Somali-born representative \u2014 accusing wife Beth Mynett in a counterclaim of waging a campaign to \u201cruin his career\u201d after he left their unhappy marriage. The DC political consultant, who has been working for Omar, denied accusations leveled by his physician wife in her divorce filing that he was having a love affair with Omar and said he hadn\u2019t been in a relationship with any other woman during their six-year marriage, according to the counterclaim filed in DC Superior Court. \u201cSince the time of Mr. Mynett\u2019s departure from the marital home, Ms. Mynett began a negative campaign against Mr. Mynett, seemingly in an effort to ruin his career and permanently damage his relationship with William and his step-daughter,\u201d read the court papers.\n\nMynett might have other reasons for issuing a denial. Omar\u2019s campaign spent a lot of money on Mynett, which might create some issues of campaign-finance violations if it turns out that the purposes of that were personal. Those would most likely be civil violations rather than criminal, but that distinction won\u2019t help Omar\u2019s political career \u2014 even if she survives the tax and immigration investigations that might soon be coming.\n\nUpdate: Much of this is based on the dogged research and reporting of PJM\u2019s David Steinberg, who noted on Twitter that the Post never credited him or Scott Johnson with their work on this story. Scott has more on that aspect of the story in a new post at Power Line.", "description": "Ready to spill the beans?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/omar-sideeye.jpeg"}
