The assets will be transferred to the venture once the projects starts up.\n\nStandard Chartered Plc and Banque Saudi Fransi are advising on the talks with local and international lenders, they said. Standard Chartered, Banque Saudi Fransi and Aramco declined to comment.\n\nThe $8-billion venture, announced in August 2018, has a 25-year contract to own and operate the project for a fixed monthly fee and will serve Aramco\u2019s Jazan refinery and terminal on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Red Sea coast. Air Products will own at least 55% of the business, with Aramco and ACWA Power holding the rest.\n\nSaudi Arabia is seeking to transform its oil-dependent economy by developing new industries, and is pushing into petrochemicals as a way to earn more from its energy deposits. The joint venture is expected to increase efficiency, facilitate foreign direct investment and private sector involvement.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Archana Narayanan in Dubai at anarayanan16@bloomberg.net;Matthew Martin in Dubai at mmartin128@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Stefania Bianchi at sbianchi10@bloomberg.net, Vernon Wessels\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A joint venture between Saudi Aramco, Air Products & Chemicals Inc. and ACWA Power is in talks with banks to raise about $6 billion in debt, people with knowledge of the matter said.The entity will use the funding to buy gasification and power facilities as well as associated utilities", "authors": ["Archana Narayanan", "Matthew Martin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
