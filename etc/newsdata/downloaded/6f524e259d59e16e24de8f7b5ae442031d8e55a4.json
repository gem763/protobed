The letter, addressed to the board and published by the Deccan Herald, charged Parekh with \u201cunethical practices\u201d to boost revenues and profit in recent quarters, anonymous whistle-blowers wrote in a memo titled \u201cDisturbing unethical practices.\u201d The whistle-blowers also said recent big deal wins may have come with negligible margins. They asked the board to investigate and take action, offering to provide emails and voice recordings to support their allegations.\n\nChairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani pledged a full investigation, saying the allegations had gone before the company\u2019s Audit Committee. The memo dated Sept. 20 was the latest in a series of whistle-blower complaints that wrought havoc at Asia\u2019s second most valuable IT services firm, triggering the exit of previous CEO Vishal Sikka after a confrontation with co-founder Narayana Murthy. The company, a symbol of India\u2019s technological boom, had gained more than 15% of market value this year as it stabilized the business with a transition toward automation.\n\nThe allegations \u201ccould severely damage the company\u2019s pristine brand if true, especially in the IT services industry,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana wrote. \u201cIt could also hurt short-term sales, as clients may look for other providers for newer projects.\u201d\n\nInfosys May Need Some Private Time to Fix Itself: Andy Mukherjee\n\nRead more: Infosys Profit Slides After Companies Skimped on Spending\n\nNilekani had only just proclaimed last year that Infosys had become \u201cboring again.\u201d The allegations come as Infosys and larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., which build software and provide services to some of the world\u2019s largest banks and retailers, navigate an increasingly difficult business environment. The industry is grappling with a trend toward automation and rapid technology changes.\n\nThis month, Infosys posted a 2% fall in quarterly profit after nervous clients held off on spending and growth in traditional service contracts stalled. That underscored the challenge for Parekh, who has pledged to drive growth in digital services, re-energize core offerings, re-skill employees and hire locally in a key U.S. market where a tightening H-1B visa regime is making it more difficult to import labor. Tata Consultancy also posted earnings that lagged projections.\n\n\u201cThe newsflow around this may dominate investor attention in the near term and could continue to support the shift toward TCS,\u201d Emkay analyst Manik Taneja wrote.\n\nRead more: Whistle-Blowers Allegations to Shrink Infosys Valuation Premium\n\nThe IT services giant itself has undergone internal upheaval in the recent past. The memo emerged days after the departure of former deputy chief financial officer, Jayesh Sanghrajka.\n\nParekh, a former Capgemini SE executive, was named to the helm in 2017 after a very public battle between his predecessor and the company\u2019s founders, who objected to Sikka\u2019s strategy and compensation. At the time, Sikka quit over what he described as \u201ca continuous drumbeat of allegations\u201d over management and corporate governance. The share price tumbled, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth.\n\nRead more: \u2018Stay Calm, Don\u2019t Panic\u2019 CEO Aims to Steady Troubled Infosys\n\nAfter the drama, which Chairman Nilekani had described as reaching \u201creality TV\u201d like proportions, the more low-key Parekh was regarded as an apt choice to lead the company. He is only the second outsider, after Sikka, to take the top job at the four-decade-old Infosys where its co-founders -- middle-class Indian engineers who started it with 10,000 rupees ($140) -- typically revolved through the CEO\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe whistle-blower complaint has been placed before the Audit Committee as per the company\u2019s practice and will be dealt with in accordance with the company\u2019s whistle-blowers policy,\u201d Infosys said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\n(Updates with shares from the second paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Abhay Singh and Devidutta Tripathy.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, ;Arijit Ghosh at aghosh@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Infosys Ltd.\u2019s shares plunged to a 10-month low after whistle-blowers accused Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of leading an effort to shore up profits through irregular accounting, turning up the heat on an IT services giant that endured internal turmoil just two years ago.The stock", "authors": ["Saritha Rai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MwDRaK35.Nn2VkDano3HLQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1079ff50949a4f0117de2417fd61f0ff", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
