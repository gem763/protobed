The pinnacle of this is Ubisoft, which does everything extra large and appears to be testing the gaming world\u2019s appetite by trying to do this with two similar games at once.\n\nThat\u2019s the risk and reward evident in yesterday\u2019s unveiling of the year-one content for Ghost Recon Breakpoint, the Tom Clancy-branded co-op shooter coming in early October that offers both PvP and PvE.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft\u2019s year-one plan:\n\nIt\u2019ll add three new story-expanding episodes that will be released in its first year.\n\nIt\u2019ll add co-op raids.\n\nIt\u2019ll add a roll-out of three new character classes.\n\nIt\u2019ll add new daily and weekly challenges.\n\nIt\u2019ll be all the Clancy gaming you could possibly play, right?\n\nExcept we\u2019re currently approaching the halfway point of the year-one content for The Division 2, the mid-March Tom Clancy-branded co-op shooter that offers both PvP and PvP.\n\nIt\u2019s in the midst of having three new story-expanding episodes released in its first year.\n\nIt\u2019s in the midst of adding co-op raids.\n\nIt\u2019s in the midst of a roll-out of three of new character classes.\n\nIt\u2019s got daily and weekly challenges.\n\nNo, these games are not identical. The Division 2 is more of a loot-based cover-based shooter and is set in a partially destroyed Washington, DC. Ghost Recon Breakpoint is more of a tactical stealth shooter and is set on a private island that serves as the headquarters of a high tech weapons maker.\n\nThey are, however, both giant-sized Ubisoft games based on the fantasy of being a badass with guns, both third-person adventures set in massive worlds, and both seem to be designed to be as all-consuming of one\u2019s playing time as other contemporary mega-games like Destiny 2, Fortnite, Anthem or even Ubisoft\u2019s own Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, which is at least winding down its year-long deluge of post-release add-ons this month.\n\nPerhaps Ubisoft is betting that there are people who have time for both games, or that the games are different enough to attract large but distinct audiences. But there\u2019s also the awkward prospect of one game showing up the other and pulling away its players.\n\nThe Division 2\u2019s community has been cranky about the state of that game, with many players hungering for more updates or at least more news about them. A lot of that news tends to be delivered in the development team\u2019s weekly State of the Game livestreams, but those have been on hiatus in August.\n\nThe show\u2019s return today was cancelled at the last minute. It\u2019s set to return next week. Tomorrow, Ghost Recon Breakpoint begins a quasi-public beta that is available to people who pre-ordered the game or who registered to be randomly selected to play it. That\u2019ll no doubt further the hype for that Clancy game.\n\nTo the extent that Ubisoft does appear to be rolling out two overlapping games, the distinctions will be all the more interesting. The Division 2\u2019s raids, for example, called for eight-player groups and wound up being played by a tiny percentage of the player base. Ghost Recon is promising raids designed for four.\n\nThe Division 2 is offering all its story episodes for free, but giving people who pay for a year-one pass the content a week ahead of time (though, bizarrely, they put it on a free test server for PC players before that). Ghost Recon\u2019s team is offering the first hour of each expansion for free, but asking people to pay to play the rest.\n\nThe previous games in the Division and Ghost Recon series were given more breathing room thanks to release dates separated by a full year. They probably still competed with each other for players\u2019 attention, but not quite like this.\n\nIs it better or worse for people who play games when a publisher seemingly competes with itself? This is not quite Nintendo trying to sell its American customers Mario Kart 64 and Diddy Kong Racing in the same year (1997, remember? What? You\u2019re too young?), but is it that far off?", "description": "It seems that every major video game publisher wants their own perpetually-updated mega-game that has a post-release content plan longer than a thousand trips around the Earth.
