By obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he\u2019s already convicted himself. In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,\u201d Biden said during a campaign event in New Hampshire. \u201cTo preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s speech came a day after the White House said it would refuse to cooperate in any way with the House\u2019s impeachment investigation, and went further than his previous remarks.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s private pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden is at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment investigation, and he\u2019s sought to sully Biden since those efforts became public. Trump recently publicly asked both China and Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nBiden pushed Ukraine\u2019s leaders to fire a prosecutor who had failed to aggressively pursue corruption in the state, a move that had bipartisan and international support. Trump has characterized that push as aimed at helping Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was serving on the board of a Ukrainian oil company, though there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s true.\n\nBiden laid out those facts during his speech, though he didn\u2019t address whether Hunter benefited at all from his own international stature.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s targeted me and my family with lies, distortions and smears. That\u2019s all they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just flat doing what he\u2019s always done: lying,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do anything it takes to stay in power, to protect himself, because he knows that out of power he may be a lot more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nTrump was quick to respond:\n\nCover: Former US Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden speaks at the SEIU Unions for All Summit in Los Angeles, California on October 4, 2019.
