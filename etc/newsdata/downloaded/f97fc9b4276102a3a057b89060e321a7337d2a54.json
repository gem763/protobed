They needed to open it up to see how much damage has been caused by the firework.\n\n\"The doctors are not sure whether he'll have full movement in his thumb. He's had endless stitches in his hand and a deep wound in his stomach.\n\n\"He was hanging out with his friend in the railway station when they came across this object that looked like a tennis ball.\n\n\"When they noticed it was a firework they both agreed to set it live while Jack was holding it.\n\n\"It went off much quicker than expected while it was still in Jack's hand. He had to strip off because his clothes were all stuck to him after the blast, and his face and body is scarred too.\"\n\nJack's friend was also rushed to hospital, but his injuries are described as minor.\n\nChristina added: \"Jack is in agony. His hands are in bits and he's been complaining a lot about his eyes. His eyelashes are singed and they are rubbing of his eyeball, but thankfully the eye doctor said that there is no damage.\"\n\nShe now wants to warn other parents to make sure they warn their children about the dangers of using fireworks.\n\n\"Especially this time of year, it's vital for parents to know the exact whereabouts of their children.\n\n\"Fireworks can cost young children their lives. Jack was very lucky but he might not have been either.\n\n\"Jack has sworn to never, ever touch a firework again after this, and hopefully his lucky escape will warn away others from using them.\"\n\nA spokesman for Garda\u00ed confirmed they were \"aware of an incident that occurred on 22 October 2019 at St Berachs Place\" in Kilbarrack.\n\nHe added: \"Two youths were taken to Temple Street Hospital with injuries sustained from a firework.\"", "description": "Teenager Jack Cooney is in 'agony' as he recovers in hospital after the freak accident in Dublin", "authors": ["Pippa Allen-Kinross"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728424.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11109JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
