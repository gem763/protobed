When Butterfield was asked about a chart Microsoft released in July during the Slack quiet period, which showed Microsoft Teams had 13 million daily active users compared to 12 million for Slack, Butterfield appeared taken aback by the chart.\n\n\u201cThe bigger point is that\u2019s kind of crazy for Microsoft to do, especially during the quiet period. I had someone say it was unprecedented since the [Steve] Ballmer era. I think it\u2019s more like unprecedented since the Gates\u2019 98-99 era. I think they feel like we\u2019re an existential threat,\u201d he told Dean.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, that as Dean pointed out, you could flip that existential threat statement. Microsoft is a much bigger business with a trillion-dollar market cap versus Slack\u2019s $400 million. It also has the benefit of linking Microsoft Teams to Office 365 subscriptions, but Butterfield says the smaller company with the better idea has often won in the past.\n\nFor starters, Butterfield noted that of his biggest customers, more than two-thirds are actually using Slack and Office 365 in combination. \u201cWhen we look at our top 50 biggest customers, 70% of them are not only Office 365 users, but they\u2019re Office 365 users who use the integrations with Slack,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to say that smaller companies have taken on giants before and won. As examples, he held up Microsoft itself, which in the 1980s was a young upstart taking on established players like IBM. In the late 1990s, Google prevailed as the primary search engine in spite of the fact that Microsoft controlled most of the operating system and browser market at the time. Google then tried to go after Facebook with its social tools, all of which have failed over the years. \u201cAnd so the lesson we take from that is, often the small startup with real traction with customers has an advantage versus the large incumbent with multiple lines of business,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked by Dean if Microsoft, which ran afoul with the Justice Department in the late 1990s, should be the subject of more regulatory scrutiny for its bundling practices, Butterfield admitted he wasn\u2019t a legal expert, but joked that it was \u201csurprisingly unsportsmanlike conduct.\u201d He added more seriously, \u201cWe see things like offering to pay companies to use Teams and that definitely leans on a lot of existing market power. Having said that, we have been asked many times, and maybe it\u2019s something we should have looked at, but we haven\u2019t taken any action.\u201d", "description": "In a wide ranging interview with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s global technology editor Jason Dean yesterday, Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield had some strong words regarding Microsoft, saying the software giant saw his company as an existential threat.
