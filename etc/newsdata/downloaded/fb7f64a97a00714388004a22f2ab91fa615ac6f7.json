But its mystery owner appears to be balking.", "language": "en", "text": "The \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d sold for a record-shattering $450.3 million in 2017. But in the two years since the sale at Christie\u2019s, controversy over the painting\u2019s attribution has intensified.\n\nThe Louvre has long said it wanted the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d in its show. The exhibition\u2019s curators, Vincent Delieuvin and Louis Frank, explicitly requested it from the owner, believed to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (the same Saudi ruler whom the CIA has accused of ordering the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe opening of \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u201d is just days away, but, according to museum spokeswoman C\u00e9line Dauvergne, \u201cwe are still waiting for an answer.\u201d\n\nThe silence is excruciating, and hard to fathom. But it may be that the owner is worried about the consequences of lending the work, and awaiting assurances the Louvre is refusing to give.\n\nThe issue is this: Some experts are convinced that Leonardo painted the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d (the vast majority of it, anyway) and have staked their reputations on it. Others are unconvinced, believing that the painting, which was in a terrible state and needed years of restoration and repainting to make it presentable, was probably painted more by the master\u2019s assistants or pupils.\n\nAD\n\nIf the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d were displayed in the Louvre\u2019s exhibition as an autograph Leonardo, it would gain the prestige of being rubber-stamped by the highest institutional authority in the world: the museum that owns the Mona Lisa, as well as four other undisputed Leonardo paintings (more than any museum).\n\nBut the Louvre curators, who plan to display works \u201cfrom the master\u2019s circle\u201d in the exhibition beside autograph Leonardos, have reserved the right to label the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d as they see fit.\n\n\u201cIf it comes,\u201d Delieuvin said in a Sept. 9 interview in the French newspaper Le Figaro, \u201cwe will say what we think. Whether it really is by the hand of Leonardo, partly so or not at all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe potential repercussions of the Louvre \u201csaying what it thinks\u201d are enormous. The differences between displaying the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d as, on the one hand, \u201cby Leonardo da Vinci\u201d and, on the other, \u201cby Leonardo and workshop,\u201d or some similar formulation are massive. A slight shift in phrasing could potentially lower the valuation of the painting by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBin Salman, if he is the owner, may not be willing to expose his acquisition to that risk. In which case, the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d will probably remain in hiding, possibly on the Saudi ruler\u2019s superyacht, the Serene, as one rumor claimed; more likely in a vault in Switzerland.\n\nThe world had a new Leonardo\n\nAD\n\nIt remains unclear why a $450 million painting that is the subject of such intense global interest vanished, so that not even an institution with the clout of the Louvre can get an answer as to its availability. But the story of how the image of Jesus as savior of the world came to be so valued is easier to tell. And it\u2019s not entirely edifying.\n\nAD\n\nJust 12 years before the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d sold at Christie\u2019s for almost half a billion dollars, art dealers Robert Simon and Alex Parish purchased it at an estate sale in New Orleans. The purchase price? Only $1,175. (According to Ben Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Last Leonardo: The Secret Lives of the World\u2019s Most Expensive Painting,\u201d \u201cno object, item or substance in the known universe has ever risen in value so fast and by so much.\u201d)\n\nThe crucial turning point in the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u2019s\u201d astonishing rise in value was a decision by another prestigious museum, London\u2019s National Gallery of Art, to include it as an autograph work by the master in a Leonardo exhibition in 2011.\n\nAD\n\nUntil then, the painting had been shown around, and even offered for sale, but experts had been reluctant to accept the attribution. The National Gallery show marked the arrival of a new Leonardo in the world \u2014 the first one to gain widespread acceptance in 100 years.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it made the painting suddenly very marketable.\n\nBut on what basis had the curator of that show, Luke Syson, included it?\n\nSyson studied the painting and its provenance very closely. \u201cThe technical information is important,\u201d he told Lewis. \u201cBut the sense of how a painting communicates is just as important.\u201d The \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d he said, \u201cseemed to hover somewhere between our realm and something spiritual.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf course, Syson knew that a painting must do more than merely \u201chover between realms\u201d to gain acceptance as an autograph work by Leonardo. So back in 2008, he asked the painting\u2019s owner, Robert Simon, to bring it across the Atlantic to the National Gallery to be examined by five great Leonardo experts.\n\nTwo of the invited experts came from Milan, one from New York, one from Washington and one, Martin Kemp, from Oxford.\n\nAD\n\nNone were asked to authenticate the painting. The discussion in the National Gallery\u2019s conservation studio was informal, and no notes were taken. But after the meeting, Syson told Nicholas Penny, who was then the director of the National Gallery but did not attend the meeting, that \u201cthe experts had agreed that the painting was indeed by Leonardo himself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was on this basis that the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d was included in the National Gallery show.\n\nYet Lewis has since revealed that the five experts were not, in fact, in agreement. The two Italians, in particular, were surprised to see that, three years later, their comments had been interpreted as a \u201cthumbs up.\u201d They had not offered a settled opinion and appeared to harbor doubts. Carmen Bambach \u2014 a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the author of a new four-volume study on Leonardo \u2014 was especially skeptical.\n\nAD\n\nBut the imprimatur the painting gained from Syson\u2019s characterization of the meeting and its subsequent inclusion in the National Gallery exhibition changed everything. The world had a new Leonardo.\n\nAD\n\nJust two years after the National Gallery exhibition, Parish and Simon sold the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d to a man named Yves Bouvier for between $75 million and $80 million. Within days, Bouvier had flipped it to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for $127.5 million. (When Rybolovlev discovered this, he was outraged and sued Bouvier. The case is ongoing.)\n\nFour years later, Rybolovlev (who in 2008 had bought a villa in Palm Beach, Fla., from Donald Trump) put the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d up for sale again. The bidding at Christie\u2019s started at $70 million. At about $90 million, it seemed to be in danger of petering out.\n\nAD\n\nBut it soon clicked back into gear and before long surpassed the record for a painting sold at auction \u2014 $179 million for Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Femmes d\u2019Algers (Version \u2018O\u2019).\u201d It continued upward from there.\n\nKemp was watching the proceedings online. He thought the painting would struggle to fetch more than $110 million.\n\n\u201cSo I went to bed,\u201d he told the Art Newspaper. \u201cAt 2 o\u2019clock in the morning my phone started ringing and I opened my emails and they were all going bing bing bing and all hell broke loose. . . . It was completely crazy.\u201d\n\nAsked for his take on the record-smashing price, Kemp said: \u201cWhat it shows is that Leonardo . . . is of a different league. . . . So I don\u2019t think this is a world record price for a painting in the normal market. It\u2019s a world record price for a Leonardo, which is a completely separate thing from anything else. It\u2019s just astonishing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe is right. It\u2019s a story as incredible as the art world has ever seen.\n\nBut even as they present themselves as spectators, experts like Kemp and Syson must also be conscious of the outsize role they have played in the valuation of the \u201cSalvator Mundi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all bombarded,\u201d Syson told Lewis, \u201cby hopeful petitioners saying, \u2018I\u2019ve found a Leonardo and no one believes it, but you will when you see it.\u2019 It\u2019s usually a hideous, ghastly, sad thing.\u201d Kemp, as one of the world\u2019s leading experts, has been even more bombarded by requests to examine dubious pretenders.\n\nThe \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d is clearly in a different category. It\u2019s a compelling case, and it may indeed be \u201cthe real thing.\u201d But the question of whether it is actually by Leonardo is exceedingly complex, and there remain as many reasons to question the attribution as to accept it.\n\nIn this 500th anniversary year, there is intense competition among museums to borrow works by Leonardo. Worldwide, there are only 13 to 15 paintings by the master, and even the Louvre has been struggling to borrow the works it would like. Last week an Italian court blocked its request to borrow Leonardo\u2019s most famous sketch, the so-called \u201cVitruvian Man.\u201d", "description": "Controversy over attribution dogs the world\u2019s most expensive painting, which is likely to be missing from blockbuster da Vinci exhibition.", "authors": ["Sebastian Smee", "Art Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/794yTDdsGLFKridN30W5y4MYiQk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FAQ5RFXMCII6PH4SCCRCAP3MRU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
