The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower may not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public, according to the Justice Department memo, which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader .\n\nInstead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had \u201cabused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,\u201d the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.\n\nIn their first public comments, lawyers for the whistle-blower said their client hopes to remain anonymous but wants to continue to cooperate with lawmakers conducting oversight.\n\nMr. Trump had brought up American aid to Ukraine to Mr. Zelensky \u2014 without mentioning that at the time he was blocking delivery of a large military assistance package that Congress had approved to help it fend off Russian aggression \u2014 and suggested that Ukraine could be doing more to help the United States, the reconstructed transcript of the call indicated.", "description": "New details have emerged about the intelligence officer who raised alarms about the president\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to open inquiries that could benefit him politically.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage", "Michael S.
