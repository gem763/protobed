I'm sure Edi is speaking with the club. He knows it's his club.\n\n'I don't know Edi's ideas exactly at the moment. I count 100 per cent on Edi this season. He's been missing for several weeks and the main thing for me is to push Edi on the pitch, so we've got a fit and in-form Edinson Cavani.\n\n'He's got the most goals for the club. Edi is very important,' Tuchel continued.\n\n'He's in the group of five players I always speak with, to have an opinion from them on all things. He's important in the dressing room and on the pitch.'", "description": "Edinson Cavani's contract with the Ligue 1 giants expires in the summer and he has already attracted heavy interest from the likes of Manchester United and Juventus.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19917996-0-image-a-10_1571480050208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
