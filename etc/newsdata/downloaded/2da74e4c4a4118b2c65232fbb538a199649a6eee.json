Now he is urging investors not to miss the chance to finance climate-friendly technologies.\n\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China may have damaged manufacturing supply chains and slowed growth in the world\u2019s two-largest economies, but the manager for the flagship $10.7 billion bond fund of Boston-based investment firm Loomis Sayles thinks investors should look for silver linings too, particularly if the eventual resolution of the tariff battle also helps the world reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nFuss says it\u2019s important that the U.S. and China resolve their differences if only to deal with a more important issue -\u2014 climate change. Their cooperation could help bring about what he describes as an \u201cimmense investment opportunity\u201d for those willing to provide capital and technologies to companies looking to help society adapt and slow down the pace of climate change.\n\nSee: Legendary bond investor: When trade war escalates, stay away from this corner of the market\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to globally get our act together,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s far and away the most important thing. It presents an enormous opportunity, but it\u2019s dependent on geopolitics.\u201d\n\nFuss feels investors should wait for opportunities in the market to provide chances to put money to work, and to be willing to take them up, even against the prevailing tide of conventional wisdom.\n\nTo underline that point, he described how on the last Thursday of September, 1981, a Salomon Brothers broker rung him up in the morning to offer a long-dated U.S. Treasury bond for sale.\n\nWorking at Loomis Sayles\u2019 former office in Boston\u2019s financial district, he needed cajoling to buy the 15-year tenor security, mainly because he felt there were richer pickings in the corporate debt space, but the investment\u2019s 15.75% yield turned out to be the highest on record for federal government debt.\n\nAfter that month, \u201crates started to go down for whatever reason, and I still don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Fuss, who added that the fall in yields to levels where many investors now pay interest to buy and hold European bonds to maturity is remarkable.\n\nThat said, opportunities to invest in technologies that help offset a rapidly changing climate haven\u2019t yet trickled down to fixed-income investors like Fuss.\n\n\u201cYou can pick up one or two things that don\u2019t involve much money and where you see the potential right now, but not enough that it\u2019s ready to be anything major. You\u2019d be lucky to get 1% of your portfolio in that,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Fuss thinks investors should be doing their homework now in order to stand at the ready when, for example, inventions come through to address climate change like those that mitigate pollution from car exhaust and airplane travel. Fuss said the potential for a new technological boom to address climate change could be similar to the evolution of steel and plastics in the 1960s, which at the time were viewed as \u201cthe industries of the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe future is vastly different from Union Carbide,\u201d referring to the hundred-year old chemical corporation, which was an early pioneer of the petrochemical industry and is now part of the Dow Chemical Company DOW, +0.88%.\n\nMeanwhile, despite a banner year for returns from corporate bonds, the contrarian money manager has stayed cautious on businesses with highly leveraged balance sheets in part because of their unattractive valuations and the risks around the U.S.-China trade war which has frozen business investment, upended supply chains, and hit manufacturing-dependent regions.\n\nFuss also sees the recent unionized worker strikes at General Motors GM, +0.83% as a potential harbinger for trouble at other American automakers which could see their own labor forces organize walkouts in the face of slow wage growth.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean? We\u2019re basically sitting out there,\u201d said Fuss, whose fund holds more than a fifth of its portfolio in cash. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough scars and experience to know that when things look like there\u2019s nothing to do, it\u2019s a good time to do your housekeeping.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, the hunt for yield has driven institutional investors, in search of assets that can produce returns in the high single-digits, further into leveraged loans and private debt markets. The International Monetary Fund in their recent financial stability report noted that a growing number of insurance companies and pension funds were trying to source income in increasingly risky and illiquid investments.\n\nYet, the average yield for the ICE BofAML U.S. High Yield Index, a basket of sub-investment grade bonds, traded at 5.64% as of Oct. 22, from 7.89% at the beginning of the year. The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond index HYG, +0.09% was sitting on a total return of 11.7% year-to-date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at that saying, \u2018Uh oh, I know that business,\u201d Fuss warned of the corporate debt boom. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in god\u2019s earth they\u2019re going to get that kind of return,\u201d he said of investors. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to get hit by that supply chain clobbering.\u201d\n\nAs for stocks, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% was flirting with its all-time high on Wednesday, and stood at less than 1% away from its record close set in July 26, FactSet data show.", "description": "Loomis Sayles\u2019 Fuss says the trade war may have damaged business supply lines and harmed the world\u2019s two-largest economies, but at resolution of the U.S. -...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT852_danfus_MG_20191023102946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
