But at some point it has to react to the reality which is that there will be an extension and elections,\" Hewson said.\n\nThe opposition Labour party said in a statement that Parliament should unite to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of the month.\n\nLast week, Britain sent a proposal to Brussels to replace the Irish border \"backstop\" - an insurance policy to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland - but this has been rebuffed by EU leaders.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly vowed to take Britain out of EU on Oct. 31 even without a divorce deal in place, but a law called the Benn Act requires him to seek a delay if a deal is not agreed by Oct. 19.\n\nThe extent of potential damage from a no-deal Brexit was underscored by a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies which said leaving without a deal would likely double Britain's budget deficit to around 100 billion pounds ($123 billion).\n\nOther data showed companies' demand for new staff rose last month at the weakest rate in almost eight years.\n\nThe political jitters, as well as signs of a deteriorating economy, fuelled a rally on British government bonds, with 10-year yields slipping more than 2 basis points to 0.425%, the lowest since early-September\n\n(By Olga Cotaga and Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Alexander Smith)", "description": "Sterling hit a one-month low against the euro on Tuesday after reports that Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union are close to breaking down.
