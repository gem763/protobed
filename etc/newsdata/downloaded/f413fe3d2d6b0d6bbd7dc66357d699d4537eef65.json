This was my rock bottom.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nNoelle blames her weight gain on a troubled relationship with food, which she says stems from her childhood.\n\nAs a youngster she was a competitive gymnast and says her coaches enforced a strict diet of no junk food. But when Noelle ditched the sport she began indulging in all the foods she had been banned from eating.\n\nShe also faced other setbacks such as being unable to get pregnant and two failed adoptions with her husband Chris.\n\nShe told Barcroft TV: \"I knew I wanted to become a mother, we struggled quite a bit and tried for years but still couldn't become pregnant.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThis caused Noelle to put on more weight and it wasn't until after the successful adoption of her four children and a pregnancy of her own, that she realised she needed to kick start her weight loss journey.\n\nNoelle then managed to shed a whopping 14 stone just by dieting and realised it was time to hit the gym.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe said: \"I had all of this energy, becoming that active after years of sitting on the couch was incredible.\n\n\"I went from being very immobile to being mobile and now the sky\u2019s the limit.\"\n\nFollowing her dramatic transformation, Noelle was left with loose baggy skin on her arms and around her belly and has now had surgery to remove it.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Adams Wood / Barcroft Media)\n\nReflecting on weight loss she said: \"I have a lot of physical changes, but for me it's the emotional and mental changes that have been the best transformation!\n\n\"I have learned to live again. I now love working out and challenging my body in how far it can go.\n\n\"Watching it transform and become stronger is an incredible feeling after abusing it for years.\n\n\"I have learned to love myself unconditionally and that means, nurture, honor and respect myself.\"", "description": "Noelle said she hit rock bottom after her scales came up with an \"error\" message and she then realised she needed to make a change once and for all - so she followed the keto diet", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Instagram", "Adams Wood", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566511.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Noelle-Dawson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
