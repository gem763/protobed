The Ripsaw M5 is a heavily-armoured 'Robotic Combat Vehicle'. It is intended to serve as a 'wingman' for manned tanks and other vehicles. The M5 can be equipped with different cannons including anti-tank missile launchers and anti-aircraft guns. It carries both an airborne drone and a robot with a manipulator arm. A surveillance turret allows the M5 to undertake reconnaissance in both night and day.\n\nManufacturer Textron Systems unveiled the Ripsaw M5 on October 14 during the 2019 Association of the United States Army exposition in Washington DC.\n\nThe M5 is the latest in the Ripsaw series of remote controlled tanks, the first of which was developed from a manned army vehicle by engineer brothers Mike and Geoff Howe, stars of the 2010 reality TV show 'Howe & Howe Tech.'\n\nThe M5 'Robotic Combat Vehicle' has been further developed as a heavily-armoured combat drone that can carry both weapons and surveillance drones into the field.\n\nThe M5 natively sports a gun turret armed with a 30-millimetre Mk. 44 Bushmaster II autocannon, which is designed to operate against both enemy infantry, trucks and armoured opposition vehicles.\n\n'We are confident that the Ripsaw M5 is [the US Army's] ideal wingman, and that we can get these vehicles out into the field where they need them \u2014 quickly,' said Textron Systems CEO Lisa Atherton.\n\nThe Bushmaster cannon is not suited to engaging with other tanks, however, but the Ripshaw M5 can be fitted with alternative weapons for different challenges.\n\nFor example, the turret can be switched with a remote-controlled Javelin anti-tank missile launcher \u2014 or even anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nThe robot can also be used to clear mines, destroy improvised explosive devices and breach obstacles and can be equipped with a plough, ground penetrating radar or a launcher for rocket-propelled lane clearing charges.\n\n'My brother Geoff and I founded Howe & Howe with the single, clear objective of safeguarding our nation\u2019s war-fighters,' said Mike.\n\n'This drive led us to develop the fastest tracked vehicle in the world, and we\u2019ve applied that same spirit and purity of innovation to the Ripsaw M5.'\n\nIntended to serve as a 'wingman' for manned tanks and other armoured vehicles, the so-called 'Ripsaw M5' is adaptable for support, combat and surveillance\n\nThe Ripshaw M5 can be fitted with alternative weapons for different challenges.

Other addons include mine ploughs and ground-penetrating radar\n\nManufacturer Textron Systems unveiled the Ripsaw M5 on October 14 during the 2019 Association of the United States Army exposition in Washington DC\n\nFor reconnaissance missions, the M5 is capable of stealthy, quiet manoeuvres and also comes equipped with a mounted surveillance turret with 360\u00b0 optical and night-vision lenses.\n\nComplementing this, the robot also serves as a carrier for two different types of drone vehicle.\n\nThese include a so-called 'Skyraider' quadcopter \u2014 which has a maximum air speed of 31 miles per hour (50 kph), can carry payloads of 4.4 pounds (2 kg) and remain airborne for as long as 50 minutes.\n\nAlongside this, the M5 can transport a smaller robot with a manipulator arm that can both climb stairs \u2014 enabling it to investigate buildings \u2014 and peer around corners using its retractable surveillance turret.\n\n'Incorporating our world-class intelligent sensors and unmanned assets on the Ripsaw M5 will provide a leap-ahead technology solution for the Army,' said David Ray, of Texton partner FLIR Systems\u2019 Government and Defense business unit.\n\n'From cameras delivering 360-degree situational awareness to surveillance gimbals, tethered drones and ground robots, we\u2019ll give our troops a tactical edge by keeping them on technology\u2019s edge.'\n\nThe M5 'Robotic Combat Vehicle' has been developed as a heavily-armoured combat drone that can carry both weapons and surveillance drones into the field", "description": "Manufacturer\u00a0Textron Systems unveiled the Ripsaw M5 on October 14 during the 2019 Association of the United States Army exposition in Washington DC.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20326292-0-image-a-5_1572354987879.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
