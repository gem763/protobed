Facebook doesn't generate the same traffic, it's not a search engine,\" he told French radio France Inter.\n\nThe French government is very unhappy with the way Google decided to implement the EU copyright directive's neighboring right in the country.\n\nGoogle changed the way press material appears online instead of signing licensing agreements with press publishers. France's main press publishers said they would file an antitrust complaint against the tech company, arguing Google abuses its dominant position.\n\nOver the weekend, publishers also turned against Facebook when it became clear the social media company was not going to pay for licenses either.\n\n\"Facebook as such does fall under the scope of the neighboring right.
