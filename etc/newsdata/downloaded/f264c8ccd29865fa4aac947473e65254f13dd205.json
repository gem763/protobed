How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nBefore you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings!\n\nSEHK:1781 Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 68% of Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Unfortunately, while Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.\n\nWe update our data on Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. This company has been paying a dividend for less than 2 years, which we think is too soon to consider it a reliable dividend stock. Its most recent annual dividend was HK$0.04 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nExamining whether the dividend is affordable and stable is important. However, it's also important to assess if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Over the long term, dividends need to grow at or above the rate of inflation, in order to maintain the recipient's purchasing power. Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings's earnings per share are down -6.0% over the past year. That's not great to see, but there could be a number of reasons for this. Should the decline continue, we would become concerned. We do note though, one year is too short a time to be drawing strong conclusions about a company's future prospects.\n\nWe'd also point out that Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings issued a meaningful number of new shares in the past year. Trying to grow the dividend when issuing new shares reminds us of the ancient Greek tale of Sisyphus - perpetually pushing a boulder uphill. Companies that consistently issue new shares are often suboptimal from a dividend perspective.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Second, the company has not been able to generate earnings growth, and its history of dividend payments too short for us to thoroughly evaluate the dividend's consistency across an economic cycle. There are a few too many issues for us to get comfortable with Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings from a dividend perspective. Businesses can change, but we would struggle to identify why an investor should rely on this stock for their income.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Sun Cheong Creative Development Holdings Limited (HKG:1781) a good dividend stock?
