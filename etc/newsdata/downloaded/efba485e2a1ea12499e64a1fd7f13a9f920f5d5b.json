Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nTrump's letter to Erdogan + Show - Hide Dear Mr President, Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy - and I will. I\u2019ve already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson. I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received. History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.\n\nSeemingly, the letter was leaked to confront those in the United States criticising Trump for waving through the Turkish offensive by pulling US troops from Syria.\n\nIt has now been confirmed as genuine by the White House, but soon after the leak on Wednesday, thousands of Turks asked each other on Twitter and WhatsApp whether the letter was authentic or a joke.\n\n\u201cIf this letter is real, Trump is absolutely completely crazy,\u201d one Turk tweeted.\n\nTurkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Middle East Eye that they responded to Trump\u2019s letter in kind and with stronger language.\n\n\u201cWe just dumped his letter into the trash,\u201d one of them said.\n\n'This Trump letter to Erdogan is the most damaging correspondence that could\u2019ve been leaked ahead of VP Pence\u2019s visit to Ankara tomorrow' - Soner Cagaptay\n\n\u201cThe date on the letter is 9 October, the same day we began Operation Peace Spring. Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm,\u201d the official told MEE.\n\nThe leak comes at a particularly sensitive time, with US Vice President Mike Pence touching down in Ankara on Thursday in a bid to seek a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurdish-led SDF.\n\n\u201cThis Trump letter to Erdogan is the most damaging correspondence that could\u2019ve been leaked ahead of VP Pence\u2019s visit to Ankara tomorrow,\u201d Soner Cagaptay, a prominent Turkey expert tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNow, Erdogan has no option but to delay ceasefire in Syria, less he be humiliated in front of his nation as weak and bowing to America\u2019s threat.\u201d\n\n'The Turkish nation and state were offended'\n\nRussia on Thursday questioned the tone of the letter, describing it as \"highly unusual\".\n\n\"You don't often encounter such language in correspondence between heads of state. It's a highly unusual letter,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMeanwhile, former prime minister Ahmet Davotoglu said all meetings with US officials should be cancelled.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish nation and state were offended,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Work with us in Syria or get out of the way' Read More \u00bb\n\nSince Washington\u2019s surprise announcement that US personnel were leaving Syria, thereby exposing the SDF, its partner in the battle against the Islamic State group (IS), to Turkish attack, Trump has veered wildly between soft and hard stances on Turkey.\n\nTweets threatening to ruin Turkey\u2019s economy have been followed by more sympathetic ones, such as a post on Wednesday saying the PKK, the Kurdish militant group Ankara says the SDF is an extension of, is worse than IS.\n\nTurkish officials maintain that Trump must have seen that his attempts to reach a compromise so far had been totally ineffective. Erdogan on Wednesday batted away several calls for a truce.\n\n\u201cYesterday he described PKK as a terror group worse than [IS]. With this background, we don\u2019t expect Pence to come up with a proposal on beginning negotiations,\u201d another official told prominent Turkish columnist Ahmet Hakan.\n\n\u201cIf Pence comes with something like that, Erdogan will strongly refuse the offer and send him back home with empty hands.\u201d\n\nThe see-sawing from the White House was already frustrating Turkey before this latest leak.\n\nErdogan earlier this week complained that he doesn\u2019t understand what Trump wants anymore.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer follow Trump\u2019s tweets. We cannot track them. There is a stark change in his stance compared to last night,\u201d he said.", "description": "Explosive correspondence threatening Turkish president sours relations even further as Mike Pence arrives in Ankara", "authors": ["Alexey Khlebnikov", "Kamal Alam"], "top_image": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/2019-10-16t221307z_1562498146_rc1b2d0cae90_rtrmadp_3_syria-security-trump-erdogan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
