I keep reliving the panic attacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still shaking about it, I\u2019ve lost my appetite, my confidence has gone and I feel nervous and afraid. My wife Meta who\u2019s very ill didn\u2019t know if I was dead or alive. Neither of us will get over this.\u201d\n\nDavey was assessed by a French doctor who treated him for low blood sugars, before he was taken to a police cell where he was offered dinner.\n\nBut Eric was left alone to negotiate a room at a hotel.\n\nEric said: \u201cDavey was assisting me to the plane but when we got to the doorway one of the staff told Davey we couldn\u2019t come on board because we\u2019d drink taken.\n\n\u201cDavey said we\u2019d had three drinks and he was very annoyed and challenged them. The whole thing blew up. But the air stewardess said we had to go. There was a whole row. Davey was very upset because he felt responsible to get me home to Meta safely.\n\n\u201cWe were not drunk. We\u2019d had three of pints of beer in the airport. Some other passengers from Northern Ireland stood up to try to help us and said it was obvious we weren\u2019t drunk.\n\n\u201cThen the Easyjet staff told us we had to go and they\u2019d called the police. So we got booted off the flight and handed over to French police.\n\n\u201cI was shocked beyond belief. I found out later Davey was put in police cells and I ended up in the Holiday Inn Express. I was terrified. I couldn\u2019t understand anyone or see anything.\u201d\n\nDiabetic Eric had not been able to charge his phone to allow his wife to get a call through to him because he could not find his charger.\n\nTo make matters worse, he could not find his insulin.\n\nEric said: \u201cI lay in the room and wept.\n\n\"Poor Meta was at home and didn\u2019t know if I was alive or dead. All she knew was that I was missing and so was Davey.\n\n\"She kept trying to phone me but my phone battery was dead. When Davey got his phone back he had 52 missed calls.\u201d\n\nThe friends, unable to contact each other by phone, made their way separately to Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport to try to find their way back to Belfast.\n\n(Image: LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nEric was helped to the Easyjet desk and said he broke down in tears when he was told they had no Belfast flights that day.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was so frightened. People helped me and eventually I got an Air France flight to Dublin for \u00a3290 and when I got to Dublin Airport someone took me to the bus stop to get to Belfast. I was in tears.\u201d\n\nDavey got home via Manchester, all the while not knowing where Eric was.\n\nDavey said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to get over this but I\u2019m very worried for Eric. He\u2019s not well at all. We\u2019d gone away to give him a break and he ended up terrified and I ended up in a police cell.\n\n\u201cThe airline staff accused us of having \u2018drink taken\u2019 and I told them that we\u2019d had three pints in the airport. I\u2019m entitled to have a drink with Eric when I\u2019m on my holidays. We were not drunk.\n\n\u201cI was furious and there was a big row because they just wouldn\u2019t let us on board. The woman said we\u2019d been swaying. I told her she\u2019d sway too if she was holding the arm of a blind man who is not too firm on his feet, while carrying our bags on a walkway to a plane.\"\n\nHe added: \"I feel terrible. I should have been able to look after Eric better. I just cannot understand how easyJet can act like that. They labelled us drunk without knowing us or taking Eric\u2019s physical ability into consideration. It was a disgrace.\u201d\n\nBusinesswoman Carina Duke who helped Eric get home from Dublin said: \u201cI could see how upset and shaken he was and I was totally outraged and disgusted when he explained what had happened to him. How can it be acceptable to treat a blind and obviously frail pensioner like this?\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Easyjet said: \u201cWe are very sorry that this incident has caused distress for Mr Smylie and Mr Pogue and we are investigating to fully understand what happened and see if any lessons can be learned.\n\n\u201cMandatory safety reports which were filed at the time report that the passengers were disruptive and aggressive towards our crew which is why the police were called to intervene and the passengers were not permitted to travel.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted the French police to understand how the two men came to be separated after they were escorted from the aircraft.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately our customers did not contact us to let us know of their situation, so we didn\u2019t offer assistance at the time.\n\n\u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all our passengers and crew is our highest priority.\u201d", "description": "Eric Smylie, from Belfast, was left stranded alone and without his medication after a nightmare trip back from France", "authors": ["Jilly Beattie", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584515.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/72366225_478187966117669_3062112133572460544_n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
