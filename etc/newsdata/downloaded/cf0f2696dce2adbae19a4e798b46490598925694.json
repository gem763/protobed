But when Botham Shem Jean\u2019s brother took the stand to address Amber R. Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who fatally shot Mr. Jean in his own apartment, he offered only forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ever say this in front of my family or anyone, but I don\u2019t even want you to go to jail,\u201d the brother, Brandt Jean, said, before getting up to wrap his arms around Ms. Guyger. \u201cI want the best for you.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a Dallas County jury sentenced Ms. Guyger, who is white, to 10 years in prison in a case that was one of the latest, and also one of the most unusual, in a series of high-profile confrontations between police officers and unarmed black men across America.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about an hour and a half before deciding upon a sentence that was well short of the maximum 99 years in prison Ms. Guyger could have received \u2014 but also longer than the two years jurors might have imposed.", "description": "Ms. Guyger, a white former Dallas police officer, fatally shot her unarmed black neighbor in his apartment.", "authors": ["Marina Trahan Martinez", "Sarah Mervosh", "John Eligon"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/us/02GUYGER/02GUYGER-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
