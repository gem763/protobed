We talked to executive director Traci Lester about overseeing this important, inclusive non-profit.\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nI have over 28 years of experience in the nonprofit sector. I\u2019ve worked with nonprofit organisations both here on the East Coast and in California. I started my career fresh out of college as a journalist and reporter in San Jose, California. Not long thereafter I entered the nonprofit sector and I\u2019ve never looked back.\n\nI have worked in philanthropy for some of the country\u2019s major philanthropic institutions, in education and in human services, and now I\u2019m working with an amazing arts education organisation.\n\nMy focus has always been supporting the needs of children and their families.\n\nWhat are your job responsibilities?\n\nI am the executive director and administrative leader at National Dance Institute, a premier arts education organisation. With over $US23 ($34) million in assets, a 18,000 square foot facility located in Central Harlem, and 71 staffers, I oversee the delivery of National Dance Institute\u2019s award-winning programming to 6,500 public school children weekly and close to 60,000 children globally (though our partnership with the Associates of National Dance Institute and our international partners in China, Lebanon and beyond). I liaise with our Board of Directors, fundraise, oversee our major marketing efforts, and guide the strategic vision of National Dance Institute.\n\nTake us through a recent workday.\n\nI wake at 6 a.m., always check the news first, and then rouse my daughter out of bed. I try to eat something before I head out the door, which is hard when you have children. Protein is key\u2014such as yogurt, almonds and fruit.\n\nOnce we leave the house, and after she makes it to school, you\u2019ll often find me heading straight to a morning meeting with either staff, partner organisations, funders or a board member. I prefer the morning for meetings to ground the day.\n\nSometimes I head first to a National Dance Institute partner school to view our program in action. I have standing weekly team meetings that happen on various days throughout the week. My work day usually ends between 6-7 p.m. unless I have evening events or after work affairs.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nI can\u2019t live without my wireless Bose earphones. I can speak on the phone while multitasking, walking or running to meetings (or even exercising).\n\nWhile I also use Google Docs, I am moving toward Asana as a data management program.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nWe work in an open office environment and there is a lot of cross collaboration and information sharing.\n\nI can\u2019t work with a lot of clutter, so I usually move things along rather quickly after I review them so my space is clear for the next big project. I only travel with my laptop outside of the office, so it\u2019s almost never on my desk.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nMy favourite shortcut involves starting my morning by creating a daily \u201cto do\u201d list of key items I want to accomplish and checking back with it even as other items emerge throughout the day. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than checking off items on my list.\n\nWhen I\u2019m on the move throughout the day, I dictate my thoughts and then in the evening I check them to make sure I\u2019ve completed everything on my list.\n\nLester at the NDI Annual Gala (Photo: Eduardo Patino)\n\nTake us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work.\n\nAt National Dance Institute we have many people involved in a multitude of projects, and we all move very quickly\u2014we are a nimble organisation and get a lot done during the workday. I make sure when we have to make decisions on things that everyone who is impacted is in the room. A 15-minute meeting saves time on the back end when we need everyone on the same page.\n\nWho are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them?\n\nNo executive director is successful without the people around them. I collaborate across teams and departments daily. At National Dance Institute, we have administrative decisions and artistic decisions, so the synergy between the administrative side and the artistic side is tantamount to successful programming.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest mistake you\u2019ve made at work, and how did you deal with it?\n\nOne strategy I have for managing my communications is emailing myself. When I have a particularly complex or sensitive email, I will always email it to myself first. This came from a lesson learned where once I accidentally sent an email to an outside donor (who mailed it back to me via the post office)! Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t anything terrible, but it was a lesson learned about being thoughtful and mindful about email messaging.\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nI use Google Calendars, and Google Docs, as well as an old style small notebook. Sometimes you just can\u2019t beat finding something quickly when it\u2019s written down in a small notebook.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nRunning is my way of recharging. I\u2019ve run 15 marathons and over 30 half marathons. I spend countless hours running. You would be surprised to learn how many of life\u2019s biggest challenges can be checked off by the miles you cover. Not only is it for my health and well-being, it\u2019s both a meditative experience and a social one.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite side project?\n\nMy favourite side project is helping my daughter to become the best person she can be.\n\nLester at Jacques Art Nest Series (Photo: Eduardo Patino)\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nI belong to a book group of amazing women and we are reading Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s The Water Dancer.\n\nCan you share a music playlist you\u2019ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?\n\nMy father passed away recently and he was a jazz saxophonist. These days I\u2019ve been listening to his music and his performances; music from the 60s and 70s\u2014straight ahead jazz and soul-jazz.\n\nI\u2019ve also been really enjoying listening to Lizzo (Melissa Viviane Jefferson) lately. I appreciate her commitment to the flute and live music. I played the flute in high school and in marching band and when she talks about her passion for music it\u2019s refreshing and wonderful to hear.\n\nWho else would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nI would like to see answers from Bryan Stevenson, the founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organisation in Montgomery, Alabama. He\u2019s a true social justice warrior and I have so much respect for his work.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nThe best advice I\u2019ve ever received is don\u2019t be humble. I think this came from my high school guidance counselor, who encouraged me to step forward and not be apologetic for any of my actions.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nOne problem that I\u2019m trying to solve is how to get enough sleep. I set my phone on silent from 10 p.m.-6 a.m., so I\u2019m hoping that will help (although I need to stop peeking at it during the night)!", "description": "The National Dance Institute involves thousands of children each year in classes, performances, school partnerships, professional development for educators, and dance programs for children with disabilities.
