These incidents don\u2019t make international headlines, but they amount to constitutional violations by the California city\u2019s police force, say civil rights attorneys.\n\nOn Thursday, attorneys for the residents filed multiple new lawsuits that they hope will lead to a systematic reform program.\n\nThe life and death of rapper Willie McCoy, 'executed' by police Read more\n\n\u201cFrankly we are disgusted with the city of Vallejo police department,\u201d said civil rights attorney John Burris, who is representing three people who claim they were recently beaten and wrongfully arrested. \u201cIn our view, it is an out of control police department.\u201d\n\nDelon Thurston, a massage therapist, is one of those suing. She says she was driving home from work last October when a Vallejo police officer pulled her over for allegedly making \u201can abrupt left turn\u201d and then along with another officer \u201cdragged\u201d her out of her car and threatened her with a Taser. The officers then forcibly searched her body, touching her breasts and genitals, she alleges\n\n\u201cI honestly felt like it was a Sandra Bland moment,\u201d Thurston said, referring to the 28-year-old black woman who died of apparent suicide in a Texas jail cell after being arrested during a traffic stop in 2015. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to me and I had to breathe all the way through it and be antagonized all the way to the station and I never got read my rights as they were pushing my face to the cement.\u201d\n\nDeyana Jenkins, another plaintiff, alleges that on 15 April a group of officers pulled her over at gunpoint for no apparent reason, then forced her from her vehicle and shocked her with a Taser before arresting her.\n\nJenkins is the niece of Willie McCoy. She said she feared that during her encounter with police, she would also be killed. \u201cI was thinking, don\u2019t do any sudden movements because I don\u2019t want his to be the last moment of my life,\u201d she said.\n\nAdrian Burrell, meanwhile, alleges that he was standing on his porch on 22 January and filming a Vallejo police officer who had stopped his cousin Michael Walton and was holding Walton at gunpoint in the driveway. The officer, Ryan McLaughlin, then demanded Burrell stop filming and go inside. According to video taken by Burrell, when he declined to stop filming, McLaughlin handcuffed him and threw him against a wooden post where he hit his head.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adrian Burrell at a press conference announcing the lawsuits.

A US marine veteran, he is currently living in Palo Alto where he\u2019s starting school at Stanford in a few days.\n\nVallejo\u2019s city manager and mayor did not respond to questions about the new lawsuits, or the idea of having their police force placed under court oversight.\n\n\u201cThe City of Vallejo has not received the lawsuits referenced today by a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney,\u201d Vallejo city attorney Claudia Quintana told the Guardian. \u201cWe cannot comment on pending litigation, but we will review any filings made and will then respond as required by court procedures. We are confident the fact-based litigation process will determine the truth in these cases.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Vallejo residents and civil rights attorneys, including Burris and Nold, asked California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, to conduct a civil rights investigation of the Vallejo police and consider using his powers to reform the department. However, it is unknown whether his office will act. \u201cTo protect its integrity, we are unable to comment on, even to confirm or deny, a potential or ongoing investigation,\u201d a spokesperson for the attorney general told the Guardian.\n\nBurris has succeeded before in having police agencies placed under federal court oversight, even without the help of the state attorney general or federal justice department. In 2000, he and another Oakland civil rights attorney, James Chanin, sued the Oakland police on behalf of 119 black men who alleged the department engaged in a pattern and practice of civil rights violations.\n\nThe city settled the case in 2003 by agreeing to have a court-appointed monitor watch over a list of institutional reforms. This reform effort is still ongoing and has cost Oakland millions, but the city\u2019s police force went from having one of the highest rates of police shootings in the state, to one of the lowest.\n\nThurston said she hopes her lawsuit helps make the case for a systematic reform push so that things change in Vallejo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gang-type of behavior that has to stop.\u201d", "description": "Behind the killing of Willie McCoy lies a pattern of discrimination and brutality exhibited by police, allege residents suing the city", "authors": ["Darwin Bondgraham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5992e6d9e04bfbd17dda23e8ba7d17643bbba7b0/71_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fbc834d56294677c49b195f951bb830f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
