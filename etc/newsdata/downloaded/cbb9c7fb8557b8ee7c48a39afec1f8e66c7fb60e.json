The Associated Press reported on Friday that Patton\u2019s donation would be returned to him and that his name was removed as a sponsor of the fundraiser.\n\n\u201cI applaud Mayor Buttigieg for returning the contribution, but at a time where police violence remains such a critical issue, it shouldn\u2019t take four months to return such a problematic contribution,\u201d Castro wrote.\n\nThe former Housing and Urban Development secretary, who has struggled to gain traction in the primary, has made police violence a central message of his campaign. Though he had one of the shortest speaking times during Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate, Castro used his limited window to talk almost exclusively about police violence in his answers about gun regulation.\n\nCastro has been especially focused on issues of social justice and criminal justice reform both on the debate stage and campaign trail this year, and his campaign has highlighted the fact that he is one of the few candidates to pay such close attention to those issues.\n\n\"While other campaigns focused on attacking bold ideas and the frontrunners in the last debate, I was the only one to highlight police violence, the shooting of Atatiana Jefferson, and I was the only candidate to point out the hypocrisy of letting ISIS fighters run free in Syria while keeping innocent children in cages at our southern border,\" Castro wrote in the email.\n\nHis mention of the men and women who have been killed by police officers have connected with activists and national organizations who have called for a sharper public message from presidential candidates on issues relating to black and Latino communities.\n\nCastro has mentioned the names of gun violence victims in almost every one of his major public appearances, including his presidential announcement speech .\n\nDuring June\u2019s Democratic debate Castro pointed to high-profile victims of police shootings like Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice. At MSNBC\u2019s Gun Safety Forum in September he held up Laquan McDonald as an example of police violence as gun violence.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth,\u201d Castro said in Tuesday\u2019s debate, alluding to the early October killing of a young woman at the hands of law enforcement. \u201cI am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.\u201d\n\nResponses from activists and other viewers to Castro\u2019s remarks catapulted his \u201cpolice violence is also gun violence\u201d soundbite to the most tweeted about moment of the evening , according to AdWeek.\n\nCastro\u2019s reference to Jefferson also resulted in increased traffic to his campaign website and a spike in fundraising, according to his campaign. Following his debate performance, his campaign traveled to Iowa to meet with community organizers and discuss policing and his plans for criminal justice reform.\n\nCastro, who is polling at 1% nationally , has not yet released his complete criminal justice reform plan but said during a racial profiling roundtable with organizers in Des Moines on Friday that he planned to do so before the end of the month.\n\nThose present for the discussion said his commitment to mitigating police violence is more clearly demonstrated than most other candidates.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a candidate other than [California Sen. Kamala] Harris who\u2019s really talking about policing. I think that\u2019s key,\u201d said Kameron Middlebrooks, president of the NAACP\u2019s Des Moines chapter, who attended a racial profiling roundtable with Castro. \u201cIf he can continue to get this message through, this could be something that really resonates. It\u2019s not high on people\u2019s minds as the weeks follow [the debates].\u201d", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro rebuked Pete Buttigieg in a fundraising email to supporters Friday, criticizing the Indiana mayor over his decision to accept funds from a former Chicago city attorney involved in the botched handling of the police shooting of teen Laquan McDonald.
