AUD/USD reached 88% of its typical ATR, so for extended gain, we\u2019d need to see a catalyst for a weaker USD.\n\nOf the remaining currency pairs, they have averaged just 32.1% of their typical daily ranges, which leaves potential \u2018meat on the bone\u2019 should the correct catalyst arrive. , , and have moved around 16-17% of their typical daily ranges, which we\u2019re sure will change as Brexit headlines begin to flow (and retail sales is also on tap).\n\nremains just off yesterday\u2019s 1-month high; continues to consolidate around 108.70, above 108.47 support. remains steady at around 7.10.\n\nAsian Cash Indices % Change\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nAsian stock markets are trading in a mixed fashion so far in today\u2019s Asia mid-session after 3-days of gains.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s has continued to extend its up move after 2-days of consolidation, where it has rallied by 0.78% despite rising political tension between the U.S. and China over Hong Kong. Leading U.S. senators have voiced support on a bill that backs Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and wants Senate to start the voting process quickly. China has continued to issue \u201cretaliatory\u201d remarks over the bill.\n\nAlso, the Hong Kong SAR government has announced one of the boldest housing policies to address rising home prices by taking back large tracts of land held by major developers and create more public housing. Other measures include public-private partnership scheme to build housing and to relax the property value cap for mortgages where such measures have boosted the shares prices of Hong Kong property developers that are leading the on-going rally in the Hang Seng Index. New World Development, Sun Hung Kai Properties, and Henderson have rallied between 3% to 5%.\n\nOver at the other end of the spectrum, Australia\u2019s has underperformed where it has declined by -0.64% led by key mining stocks over concerns on plunging iron ore prices. The price of iron ore has tumbled by more than 3% to hit a 6-week low yesterday after China\u2019s top steelmaking city of Tangshan issued a smog alert that requires mills to limit operations further. Share prices of BHP and Rio Tinto (LON: ) have declined by -2.5% and -2.1%, respectively.\n\n(LON: ) have declined by -2.5% and -2.1%, respectively. The E-Min futures are almost unchanged in today\u2019s Asian session as it has traded in a tight range of 7 points, holding above yesterday\u2019s low of 2984.\n\nUp Next\n\nUK retail sales are expected to recover to 3.2% YoY after falling to 2.7% last month on weaker online sales. Monthly retail sales are expected to dip -0.1% versus -0.3% previous. Naturally, Brexit headlines are going to be the bigger driver for GBP crosses, although worth noting that cable did fall 80 pips following a slew of weak data yesterday, where CPI, PPI, and retail prices. Whilst we may not see the same reaction with a miss today, it would add further weight to the weaker data.\n\n(MS) US building has surged since the Fed cut rates (up 15.5% YoY) and is considered a leading indicator to the broader economy, given it feeds into construction, mortgages, and therefore consumer sentiment. It may not be a huge market mover, but something to consider as markets are heavily expecting further cuts from a Fed who don\u2019t sound overly dovish. (KW) U.S Housing data for Sep. After a dismal U.S. Retail Sales print yesterday that has indicated a negative growth m/m, housing data will be monitor closely to gauge the health of another significant component of the U.S. economy. The consensus for Building Permits and Housing Starts is expected to come in at 1.35 million and 1.32 million, respectively, where the trend has been rising steadily over the past 2-months since Jul 2019.\n\nU.S. Industrial Production for Sep, where consensus is expecting a decline of -0.1% m/m from 0.6% m/m/ recorded in Aug. A worse than expected print reinforces the view that manufacturing activities have continued to face downside pressure from trade tension, and the U.S. administration may see an urgency to get the partial trade deal with China signed off.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
