He requested that they donate the funds through Venmo so he could buy his \u201csupply\u201d of Busch Light.\n\nKing went on to raise more than $1 million and donated the money to the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Children\u2019s Hospital. Busch Light and Venmo pledged to match King\u2019s fundraising efforts.\n\nThe newspaper report, however, included a \u201croutine background check\u201d of King\u2019s social media history. Register reporter Aaron Calvin came across two racist jokes that dated back to 2012 when King was a 16-year-old high school student, \u201cone comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Media Des-Moines-Register-Carson-King-Aaron-Calvin"], "top_image": ""}
