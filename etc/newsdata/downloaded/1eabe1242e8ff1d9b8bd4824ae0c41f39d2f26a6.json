He was 85.\n\nHis publisher, Penguin Random House, announced his death in a press release Wednesday.\n\nAtwood said in a statement that her longtime love \u201cwent out on a high.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of Graeme, our beloved father, grandfather, and spouse, but we are happy that he achieved the kind of swift exit he wanted and avoided the decline into further dementia that he feared. He had a lovely last few weeks, and he went out on a high, surrounded by love, friendship and appreciation. We are grateful for his wise, ethical, and committed life.\u201d\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale author recently told TIME for its Sept. 3 cover story that she became a caretaker to Gibson while he battled dementia, bringing him to doctor\u2019s appointments while completing her latest novel, The Testaments, a sequel to her acclaimed dystopian best-seller.\n\nThe literary couple met in writing circles in the 1970s they lived together in Toronto until his death. Although the two never married, they had a daughter together, Eleanor Jess Atwood Gibson, in 1976. Gibson previously had two sons \u2014 Matthew and Grae Gibson \u2014 with Shirley Gibson.\n\nMargaret Atwood and Graeme Gibson in Mantova, Italy on December 7, 2017.

He went on to pen fiction books including Gentleman Death and Communion and non-fiction books including The Bedside Book of Birds and Eleven Canadian Novelists \u2014 which featured an interview with Atwood herself. His final book, The Bedside Book of Beasts, was published in 2009.\n\nHe was a founding member of multiple writers\u2019 organizations, including the Writers\u2019 Trust of Canada, PEN Canada and Writers\u2019 Union of Canada, which created the Graeme Gibson Award in 1991 to honor \u201cvaried and remarkable contributions\u201d to improve circumstances for Canadian writers.\n\nThe author\u2019s passion for literature was only matched by his love for birds. He served as a council member of the World Wildlife Fund Canada and also served, with Atwood, as BirdLife International\u2019s Rare Bird Club\u2019s Joint Honorary President.\n\nWith a shared love of literature and birding, Gibson and Atwood remained close in their decades together, as noted in a 2017 New Yorker profile of Atwood, which also confirmed his early dementia diagnosis and their shared support for Canada\u2019s dying-with-dignity movement.\n\nWrite to Rachel E.
