The fires are an annual problem but this year is the worst since 2015 due to the dry weather.\n\nOn Tuesday, Greenpeace accused Indonesia of failing to impose serious penalties on pulpwood and palm oil firms that had large fires on their land between 2015 and 2018, with more fires on some of those farms also polluting the region\u2019 this year.\n\n\u201cMany of the palm oil and pulp groups with the largest burned areas in their concessions have either not received any serious civil/administrative sanctions, or have had sanctions imposed that do not appear to fit with the level or frequency of burning,\u201d the environmental action group said in its report.\n\nIndonesian forest fires burn causing toxic haze across south-east Asia \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nIndonesia\u2019s environment ministry said law enforcement had been \u201cvery strict\u201d through administrative sanctions, including revoking licences and civil lawsuits.\n\nAlmost 10 million people under 18 \u2013 a quarter of them under five \u2013 live in the areas worst affected by fires on Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra island and the country\u2019s part of Borneo island, UN children\u2019s agency Unicef said.\n\nSmall children are especially vulnerable due to undeveloped immune systems while babies born to mothers exposed to pollution during pregnancy may have problems such as low birth weight, the agency said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fire fighters try to extinguish fire at a peatland in Kampar.
