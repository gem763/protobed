He\u2019s back in that position. Some people would see the separation of government from bureaucracy as a good thing. In my experience, it\u2019s actually a bad thing. It gets in the way of getting things done because you end up with separate agendas. When you put the two together, you get a shared agenda.\n\nJohn Scales\n\n2. John Kunkel\n\nScott Morrison's chief of staff\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nJohn Kunkel: Built and maintained power.\n\nAt the heart of the government and never far from the Prime Minister, Kunkel is one of the most powerful men in Canberra. Despite being all but written off by the media and most of Parliament with expectations of a May federal election loss, the respected adviser and his team working in Scott Morrison\u2019s office have built and maintained power, adding even more influence as a third-term government reinvents itself.\n\nAn economist and one-time senior adviser in John Howard\u2019s cabinet policy unit, Kunkel knows how the place works. Considered a savvy backroom operator, he brings a laser-like focus to the needs of the Prime Minister\u2019s \u201cquiet Australians\u201d. He previously worked for former Nationals leaders Mark Vaile and Tim Fischer, later becoming deputy chief executive at the Minerals Council of Australia before joining Rio Tinto as its government relations adviser. Fully signed up to the Morrison project, Kunkel knows what to expect when business comes to Canberra and speaks with the authority of his boss, despite shunning the limelight.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nThe people I\u2019ve talked to say it\u2019s clearly Kunkel who is over everything. Nothing happens without Kunkel\u2019s knowledge and understanding and input.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nJohn Kunkel is the doer for Scott Morrison. He is the \u2018I can get it done\u2019 person.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nJohn Kunkel is driving a lot of the policy development. He\u2019s very much on the input side.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mathias Cormann\n\nFinance Minister\n\nLast year: 5 (Overt)\n\nMathias Cormann: Re-established his influence.\n\nBumped from the Overt power list after his role in the bungled leadership challenge of 2018, Cormann has rebuilt his influence within the Coalition in the wake of the May election victory but remains a diminished figure outside Parliament\u2019s ministerial wing.\n\nMany wondered why the money man couldn\u2019t count during a party room ballot. Close to Scott Morrison and key ministers including Josh Frydenberg and Peter Dutton, he leads critical Senate negotiations and is a trusted media messenger for the government. He won praise for the passage of the income tax package. In the Finance portfolio, he\u2019s central to delivering the long-promised budget surplus and has shaken off rumours he would quit politics to return home to Western Australia.\n\nCormann is the sole survivor of the original Coalition cabinet crafted by Tony Abbott in 2013, and has a key role in delivering the Morrison agenda. After rebuilding his influence under Scott Morrison\u2019s prime ministership, including around the cabinet table, Cormann remains entrenched on the power list.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nHe is able to ring up or walk in and speak to Scott Morrison any time he wants.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nEverything in the Senate goes through Mathias. I think there was a period there where he just withdrew a bit but he\u2019s back and he\u2019s very influential.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nPeople say he\u2019s running the Senate and getting stuff done and that during the election campaign he was very strong. Cormann\u2019s done more work than anybody to rebuild that trust internally within the Liberal Party.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Yaron Finkelstein\n\nScott Morrison's principal private secretary\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nYaron Finkelstein: A key link to the Coalition backbench.\n\nAt the heart of Scott Morrison\u2019s political team, Finkelstein has shunned the spotlight embraced by previous high-profile advisers inside the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nHe spent five weeks travelling wherever the Prime Minister went during the federal election campaign, bringing a renowned strategy mind to the marginal seat battle around Australia. He brings experience with the Business Council of Australia, Liberal pollsters Crosby Textor and the office of former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson to the operation.\n\nNow back inside the PMO, Finkelstein is a key link to the Coalition backbench, helping strengthen the government\u2019s political base and working closely with party director Andrew Hirst. He helps control access to his boss and shapes the government\u2019s message in question time and on set-piece policies.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nFinkelstein\u2019s the more political person. And he\u2019s the one who says, \u2018Not that message. This message\u2019 or \u2018This needs to be done\u2019. He\u2019s relied on.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nOn the implementation side of the Prime Minister\u2019s political strategy, I think Yaron\u2019s very important.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Nick Warner\n\nDirector-General of the Office of National Intelligence\n\nLast year: 6\n\nNick Warner: Power is matched by authority.\n\nAs an experienced diplomat, intelligence official, public servant and now director-general of the Office of National Intelligence, there are few people with more sway inside the government and the powerful National Security Committee of Cabinet.\n\nReturning higher up the list in 2019, Australia\u2019s spy chief briefs the prime minister personally on threats and emerging challenges from around the world, bringing together power from across the reorganised network of intelligence and national security agencies in Canberra, and drawing on his own experience from 40 years of service, including as an ambassador, Defence Department boss and international adviser to John Howard.\n\nWarner\u2019s power is matched by authority, networks and know-how; it acts as a buttress against threats of foreign influence, espionage and interference, meaning he\u2019s never far from critical decisions.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nDon\u2019t forget, bureaucrats like Warner see a hell of a lot that they can\u2019t release, which is partly driving that important foreign policy agenda for the government.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nThat strategic policy shift and concern by the bureaucracy of foreign interference and influence within our political parties has been played out in a way that shows bureaucrats are clearly shaping and pushing the foreign policy agenda.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nThe security intelligence chiefs have taken over foreign affairs policy and reflected what has been a global shift. Australia has been right in there with Huawei and the more aggressive position against China, and shoring up the US relationship has been the security stance.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Rupert Murdoch\n\nNews Corp owner and press baron\n\nLast year: 4\n\nRupert Murdoch: His support for the PM will critical to the Coalition's future success.\n\nThe Australian-born executive might have been out of sight during the federal election campaign but Murdoch-owned outlets retained their legendary influence in backing the Coalition to a shock win over a resurgent Labor. Bill Shorten\u2019s decision to snub an invitation to meet the News Corp owner in New York was considered a master stroke before his loss, but future leaders will think twice before turning down such an audience.\n\nAs Murdoch moves to hand more power to his children and sells down interests in the empire he has spent a career amassing, his Sky News and tabloid newspapers speak in a single voice for the conservative wing of Australian politics, amplifying their message across platforms. Murdoch\u2019s support for Scott Morrison will be critical to the Coalition\u2019s success in future. Few can imagine power like the media mogul.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nLabor ran two maybe unloseable elections \u2013 in NSW and federal \u2013 saying they can win without News Corp. And Labor lost, convincingly, in both. That has actually rebuilt the power of the News Corp tabloids in particular.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nIf you include Sky in with The Australian, they\u2019re all part of the same organism. It did have a material impact on the leadership change and in the momentum towards it, which then produced, in effect, the new Prime Minister and the new reality we\u2019ve got.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nA key driver and one of the reasons the government is in power is because it did so well in central and northern Queensland. The key driver of that was attitudes and debate about Adani. Why did Adani become a huge issue? Because some parts of the media drove it very strongly. For example, in the middle of last year, Sky went free-to-air outside the five mainland capitals and I think the implications of that are completely missed.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nIt is very much a desire of leaders to want to keep the Murdochs on side. That\u2019s the reality of it.\n\nTony Mitchelmore\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Hirst\n\nLiberal Party director\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nAndrew Hirst: Helped secure a historic win.\n\nWhen Hirst took over as the Liberal Party\u2019s federal director in 2017, few gave him much chance of winning the next election. Instead he helped secure a historic win on his first attempt, quickly brushing off praise for his performance, redirecting it towards newfound champions, especially the Prime Minister himself.\n\nHirst has previously worked for four Liberal leaders including John Howard, Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and served as Tony Abbott\u2019s deputy chief of staff during his troubled government. He later headed to pollsters Crosby Textor before returning as the Liberal Party\u2019s communications director for the 2016 election. His attention to detail, strategic planning and resource management at the Coalition\u2019s election headquarters in Brisbane won praise across the party, alongside his reputation as one of the nice guys of Canberra politics and a straight shooter.\n\nHirst\u2019s power will help guide the government through a new term, including strategy and messaging, and preparations for another swing at Labor in 2022. Until then he\u2019ll be a regular presence in Morrison\u2019s office and will meet regularly with backbench MPs, sharing polling, directing resources and acting as a conduit for donors.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nAndrew Hirst is seen as being the trusted adviser. Scott Morrison trusts him implicitly. He trusted him and he excelled at running that campaign and just getting it all done. He\u2019s in the inner circle in that respect.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nHirstie ran a flawless campaign and earned the respect of all the senior Coalition figures. He is clearly now very influential with the PM and this will inevitably grow over time.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nI think Andrew Hirst\u2019s power is not just through association with the Prime Minister. You win an election like that as a party operative and you are going to have enormous influence. I imagine whatever he says now will be electoral gospel for years to come.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Catherine Livingstone\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia chairman\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nCatherine Livingstone: Keen dedication to innovation and the national interest.\n\nCBA chairman since January 2017, Livingstone has helped steer the scandal-hit Commonwealth Bank group through the Hayne banking royal commission, maintaining a trademark poise and steely demeanour during APRA\u2019s scathing investigation into the bank\u2019s internal culture and bluntly blaming complacency under the former board for the need to clean house.\n\nIn a period when banking bosses aren\u2019t exactly popular in Canberra, Livingstone brought her strict adherence to governance and supreme networking skills to the task of rebuilding, watching on as the business community takes up the self-assessment task to lift standards across the board.\n\nA former chairman of Telstra, the Business Council of Australia and the CSIRO, Livingstone is also a former Cochlear chief executive and sits on the board of Macquarie.\n\nKnown for a keen dedication to innovation and the national interest, she is respected for her leadership on improved gender diversity on corporate boards and an end to unconscious bias in business, as well as advocating for better workplaces for women around the country.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nCatherine Livingstone wields significant influence across the community by virtue of being chair of CBA. You\u2019re very powerful in a role like that, and she does have a strong influence across the board and her embracing of the APRA self-assessment review has led every other institution to do the same thing, which has had a big impact on corporate boards.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nHer influence extends well beyond CBA. She\u2019s had a range of other engagements around education and in other areas as well.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Alan Joyce\n\nQantas CEO\n\nLast year: 2 (Cultural)\n\nAlan Joyce: Frontline role in Australia\u2019s social debates.\n\nFew business leaders have as much cut-through as Joyce. Having turned the struggling airline around after sensationally grounding its fleet in 2011, Joyce withstood losses during a restructure designed to put Qantas on a stronger footing for sustained earnings growth \u2013 making it one of the most profitable airlines in the world, and making him Australia\u2019s highest paid CEO.\n\nQantas continues to lower costs and improve customer service through innovation, and Joyce has joined forces with Virgin\u2019s Paul Scurrah to take on fees and charges from airports. Meanwhile he plays a frontline role in some of Australia\u2019s biggest social debates. For that he has attracted heavy criticism from opponents in business and politics.\n\nIf Joyce stays the course at Qantas and sees out another three years in the top job, he will have been chief executive for 14 years. He is already the sixth-longest-serving CEO in the ASX top 50 and plans a number of ambitious goals by 2022, including boosting profits from frequent flyers to $500 million, a new fleet of aircraft and starting ultra longhaul services to Europe and the United States.\n\nKeyed in with boardroom peers here and overseas, when Joyce comes to Canberra, Parliament pays attention.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most powerful CEOs, I would say it has to be Alan. In terms of shifting the direction, it\u2019s him. He\u2019s one of the longest-serving CEOs now. And he hires well.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nI think Joyce turned around Qantas, he\u2019s led the social movement and social-issues campaign in business.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Ian Silk\n\nAustralianSuper CEO\n\nLast year: 9\n\nIan Silk: High-profile operator and legendary figure.\n\nAt the top of Australia\u2019s largest industry super fund, Silk\u2019s influence reaches throughout the economy and into the homes of everyday workers around the country. As many as one in 10 of us have retirement savings with AustralianSuper, which has more than $171 billion in funds under management.\n\nA high-profile operator and legendary figure in the sector, he has held the job for more than a decade, while also serving as president of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors and director of Industry Super Australia. This year Silk previewed significant changes to the fund\u2019s investing model. All its capital was handled by external managers some 12 years ago but now, only 60 per cent is managed externally, with the rest in-house. Silk forecast much greater direct investment, changing AustralianSuper\u2019s operating model for more than 2.3 million members. He\u2019s also using his influence to direct a greater focus on environmental, social and governance issues including gender parity for boards, while rejecting a push for industry funds to be beholden to activist agendas.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nThe observation on Ian Silk that I thought was very interesting\n\nis that he is a person for everybody and wields influence with everybody.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nThe industry funds are going to be transforming capital formation in Australia and he is as good a figure as anyone to represent that.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nIt is a lot of money. The fact that we\u2019re seeing asset managers leaving Australia is almost due, solely, to Ian Silk. The power of industry funds will continue to grow.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
