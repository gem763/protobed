Both fighters have had a very similar path to the top, but only one will cap off 2019 as undisputed champ.\n\nMax Holloway might have failed to capture the interim 155-pound title, but he\u2019s still marching steadily at featherweight. It\u2019s been over six years since Holloway lost at 145 pounds, as he looks to defend his title against a tough and durable Alexander Volkanovski, who will look to add more gold to City Kickboxing.\n\nFinally, the consensus greatest female fighter of all time and current double champ, Amanda Nunes, will return to action when she puts her bantamweight strap on the line against seasoned striker and former featherweight champ Germaine de Randamie.\n\nCheck out the official poster (via Twitter) for UFC 245, which takes place Dec. 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas:\n\nAll roads lead to Las Vegas!
