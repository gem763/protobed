Italus is a loricate pine and was discovered in 2017 by chance in the Serra della Ciavole mountainside\n\nItalus is 1,230 years old and is located at an altitude of 1,900 meters above sea level. It grows on a very steep rocky slope which protects the ancient trunk and branches from fires and lightning as well as keeping it at a cooler temperature\n\nStudying its growth through shifting climates could also help scientists better understand how forests respond to global warming.\n\nItalus germinated in 789 AD - the year the Vikings disembarked on English shores for the first time, according to a research paper published last May.\n\nThe tree sit at an altitude of 1,900 meters above sea level, on the southern slope of Serra della Ciavole mountains.\n\nCarmelo Pizzuti, an official from the Pollino National Park, said the special tree needs to be preserved for future generations.\n\nHe told LaC News24: 'We have a duty as an institution to make the scientific value of this tree known to many more people.\n\n'With respect to tourism, however, we must ask ourselves questions about conservation. We must guarantee the conservation of the tree also for future generations.\n\n'We are working to put in place important structures, including communication, so as to leave the tree standing as long as possible as it has already remained in its current position for 1,230 years.'\n\nCarmelo Pizzuti, mountain guide and official of the Pollino National Park, inspecting Italus, the oldest tree in Europe, at the Pollino National Park\n\nItalus germinated in 789 AD and was named after a king who ruled Calabria before Greeks set foot on the Italian peninsula\n\nItalus has survived a number of different weather conditions over the last millennium, including a colder period in Medieval times, and rising temperatures over the last 100 years.\n\nDespite the unpredictable climate of recent years, the millennium-old pine has seen a recent surge in growth.\n\nResearchers noticed that after laying down smaller rings in its trunk for the last few centuries, the ancient pine has grown more substantial rings, which indicates better environmental conditions.\n\nThe name 'Italus' came from the origins of the region and is named after a king who ruled Calabria before Greeks set foot on the Italian peninsula.\n\nPizzuti added: 'Italus came spontaneously, we went back to the history of our region.\n\n'When the ancient Greeks came to our shores, they knew that the Enotrio people already existed, their king was Italus. We can say that, in a certain sense, Calabria was the first Italy and on this basis we chose the name for the most ancient tree in the park.'", "description": "Researchers nicknamed the pine 'Italus' when it was discovered by chance in 2017 growing in the Pollino National Park in\u00a0Calabria, Italy.
