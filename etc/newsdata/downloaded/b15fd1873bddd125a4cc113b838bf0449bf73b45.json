Everybody wants to resolve this peacefully and the end result has to be an end to Iran\u2019s aggressive policies.\u201d\n\nIran has denied it carried out the attack with President Rouhani calling it a reciprocal act by the \u201cYemeni people\u201d.\n\n\u201cUS is in denial if it thinks that Yemeni victims of 4.5yrs of the worst war crimes wouldn\u2019t do all to strike back,\u201d foreign minister Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nBut on Saturday, the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) took a more defiant tone and said the country would \u201cdestroy\u201d any aggressor.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Major General Hossein Salami said on state television.\n\n\u201cOur readiness to respond to any aggression is definitive. We will never allow a war to enter our land. We will pursue any aggressor. We will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia has warned that if it finds that last week\u2019s attack on its oil facilities were launched from Iranian territory then it would be considered an \u201cact of war\u201d.\u201cWe hold Iran responsible because the missiles and the drones that were fired at Saudi Arabia ... were Iranian-built and Iranian-delivered", "authors": ["Gemma Fox"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BMRJd0.7AcF5OFD.0_ziww--~B/aD0zMTc7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/fb215afd9ddda951a551e3ef0e4fe4ab", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
