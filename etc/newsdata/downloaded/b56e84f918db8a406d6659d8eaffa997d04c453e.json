Trysta Krick recaps it all and looks ahead to the epic finale. USA TODAY\n\nCould baseball fans ask for a better way to conclude the season? The Nationals and Astros will play Game 7 on Wednesday (8:08 p.m. ET) to decide the World Series champion after Washington won Game 6.\n\nAfter being scratched from his Game 5 start due to back and neck spasms, Nationals ace Max Scherzer will pitch against Astros right-hander Zack Greinke, who was acquired just before the trade deadline. It's the first time in World Series Game 7 history that former Cy Young winners will face each other.\n\nBut in the chess match that is a winner-take-all game, expect a lot of mixing and matching of pitchers from each side if either one struggles.\n\nREMEMBER THESE? Game 7 moments worth revisiting before Astros-Nationals World Series ends\n\nThe road team has won every game in this series. Will it continue in Game 7? Here's how our USA TODAY Sports experts see the game playing out:\n\nA general view of Minute Maid Park at the World Series. (Photo: Erik Williams, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBob Nightengale (@Bnightengale): This game will feature 14 pitching changes, even with Scherzer and Greinke starting \u2013 and last nearly five hours. We will see Gerrit Cole one more time for the Astros. We\u2019ll see starters Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez pitching in relief for the Nats. We\u2019ll see plenty of craziness. In the end, we will see Jose Altuve hit the walk-off. Astros 4, Nationals 3 (10 innings).\n\nGabe Lacques (@GabeLacques): A back-and-forth World Series gets an appropriately wacky coda. Scherzer is OK but not long for the game, and the Astros chip away at the parade of Nationals hurlers that follow and hang on. Astros 8, Nationals 7.\n\nScott Boeck (@ScottBoeck): The home team finally wins a World Series game and it\u2019s the game that matters the most. While Scherzer shows grit by starting Game 7, Alex Bregman homers again to lead Houston to their second championship in three years. Astros 5, Nationals 3.\n\nJesse Yomtov (@JesseYomtov): The Nationals are 9-0 in games started by Scherzer and Strasburg in the postseason and there's no reason to think that won't continue. Washington will get the timely hits that eluded the team at home and hang on to win the franchise's first title. Nationals 3, Astros 1.\n\nSteve Gardner (@SteveAGardner): With the pitching staffs running on fumes, the hitters on both teams finally come alive in Game 7. It's hard to imagine Scherzer going more than four innings, considering his condition on Sunday. Look for the Astros to have a big inning after Scherzer exits and hold off a frantic Nats rally down the stretch. Astros 10, Nationals 8.", "description": "It all comes down to this: Game 7 of the World Series between the Nationals and Astros. Max Scherzer will face Zack Greinke.
