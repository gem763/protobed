Bloomberg reported that \u2018Trump administration officials are discussing ways to limit US investors\u2019 portfolio flows into China\u2019 either by delisting the companies such as Ali Baba or by limiting the US exposure to the Chinese market via government pension funds. Such move would not only have a tremendous impact on billions worth of investment, but it could also raise the risk of retaliation from China, which has recently removed the quotas for foreign investors in an effort to open its economy.\n\n\n\nBut this could be just a rumor. A US Treasury official said that they have no plans to limit Chinese companies from listing in the US exchanges \u2018at this time.\u2019\n\n\n\nUS and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in early October to discuss a trade deal. The outcome of this month\u2019s meeting remains very unpredictable as clashing news hit the headlines on a daily basis. Donald Trump had recently said that a deal could be sealed sooner than what everyone thinks.\n\n\n\nUS equity futures gained in Asia. The Dow Jones (+0.40%), the S&P500 (+0.38%) and Nasdaq futures (+0.55%) advanced as the dust settled.\n\n\n\nGold fell 0.36% to $1491 an ounce. A further advance in US equities could continue pressurizing the yellow metal downwards, as the 40-day negative correlation between the S&P500 and gold has risen during September to reach 57% on Friday\u2019s close. On the other hand, the speculative long positions in gold reached the highest levels in more than three years during the week to September 24th, according to the latest CFTC data. This means that there is good potential for a further dwindle in gold prices.\n\n\n\nShanghai\u2019s Composite failed to follow up on its early session gains after Caixin\u2019s PMI showed a faster expansion in manufacturing activity in September.\n\n\n\nTear gas, rubber bullets, petrol bombs, violence, and fire. Protests in Hong Kong overwhelmed the city\u2019s streets for the seventeenth consecutive weekend. Hang Seng gained timidly as most investors had already trimmed their exposure to Hong Kong stocks before the weekend. But the week is not over. There is mounting anxiety among investors as the October 1st celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party could further inflame protests in the city and shatter whatever is left of investor appetite.\n\n\n\nThe US dollar gained against most G10 currencies in Asia and the US 10-year yield kicked off the week a touch below 1.70%.\n\n\n\nJapanese equities led losses in Asia. Nikkei (-0.54%) and Topix (-1.02%) declined, as the industrial production in Japan tanked 1.2% in August, versus -0.5% expected and +1.3% printed a month earlier. Soft data failed to revive hopes that additional monetary stimulus from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would do any good to the economy shaken by trade disruptions and an increasingly depressed investor mood.\n\n\n\nA similar story hit the New Zealand dollar at the start of the week. The Kiwi nosedived as the business confidence deteriorated in September following an unprecedented 50 basis points cut from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand last week.\n\n\n\nThe euro remains under a decent downside pressure below the 1.0960 handles. A large 1.0900 put expiry today keeps investors alert on a potential move below this level \u2013 which could trigger stops and accelerate the sell-off, as the single currency remains highly vulnerable to weak economic data. Due today, German retail sales may have improved by 0.5% m-o-m in August, versus the frightening 2.2% decline printed a month earlier. But the German consumer price inflation may have eased from 1.4% to 1.3% y-o-y in September, as a result of a disquieting contraction in manufacturing activity and a deteriorating sentiment amid trade disruptions and slowing global demand have taken a toll on the Eurozone\u2019s growth engine. A move below.\n\n\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wouldn\u2019t resign even if he fails to get the Brexit done by October 31st. The pound gave back half of September gains against the US dollar. The pair hit 1.2272 on Friday, the 50% retracement on September rebound, and a further decline to 1.2198, the major 61.8% retracement, is plausible.\n\n\n\nData-wise, the final second-quarter GDP read is due today. The UK\u2019s gross domestic product is expected to have contracted 0.2% in the second quarter, due to a mixed bag of factors including the global economic slowdown caused by the US-China trade disruptions, and of course the Brexit, which left businesses in a no man\u2019s land for a twelfth quarter.\n\n\n\nThe rapid pound depreciation onboarded more investors to the UK\u2019s relatively cheapened blue chips. The FTSE 100 rallied past the 7400p mark and closed 1.02% up on Friday.\n\n\n\nfutures remained flat at the start of the week, hinting at a neutral open in London. Cheapening pound will likely give support to the FTSE near the 7400p.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 12 points lower at 7414\n\n\n\nto open 24 points lower at 12357\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
