The actress rose to fame in Weinstein-produced films like Emma and Shakespeare in Love, and eventually became one of Twohey and Kantor\u2019s first sources, although she remained off the record in the final story. This morning, talking with Savannah Guthrie on the Today show, Paltrow explained why she got involved, even though she was \u201cscared.\u201d \u201cI really felt like it was time,\u201d she told Guthrie. \u201cI think also having a teenage daughter [Apple] that\u2019s the love of my life and worrying about her going into the workplace, and feeling like if there was ever a chance that, you know, there could be a cultural shift on this stuff, I wanted to participate in [it].\u201d Reflecting on the impact of the investigation, she added, \u201cI never could have imagined that, you know, collectively, a shift this seismic could happen, but I feel proud that I have a small part in it.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Paltrow, who appeared to promote her role in Ryan Murphy\u2019s new Netflix series The Politician (out tomorrow, her birthday!), explained her now-iconic Emmys shimmy-walk. \u201cI think that you just look like you\u2019re walking normally,\u201d said Guthrie, still wearing the friendship earrings she once got with the woman herself. \u201cI think I look pretty normal too,\u201d Paltrow agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t totally get it. Although, there was no slit in the back of the dress \u2014 it was from 1963, a couture Valentino gown, so I didn\u2019t want to chop a slit in it.\u201d Makes sense to us!", "description": "The actress, who got her start in multiple Weinstein-backed films, spoke to Savannah Guthrie on the Today show about the reporting in Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor\u2019s book revealing that she helped start the investigation.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-gwyneth-paltrow.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
