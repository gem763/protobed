The version below appears in the October 23, 2017, issue. 1.\n\nSince the establishment of the first studios, a century ago, there have been few movie executives as dominant, or as domineering, as Harvey Weinstein. He co-founded the production-and-distribution companies Miramax and the Weinstein Company, helping to reinvent the model for independent films with movies including \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d and \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d Beyond Hollywood, he has exercised his influence as a prolific fund-raiser for Democratic Party candidates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. His movies have earned more than three hundred Oscar nominations, and, at the annual awards ceremonies, he has been thanked more than almost anyone else in movie history, ranking just after Steven Spielberg and right before God. For more than twenty years, Weinstein, who is now sixty-five, has also been trailed by rumors of sexual harassment and assault. His behavior has been an open secret to many in Hollywood and beyond, but previous attempts by many publications, including The New Yorker, to investigate and publish the story over the years fell short of the demands of journalistic evidence. Too few people were willing to speak, much less allow a reporter to use their names, and Weinstein and his associates used nondisclosure agreements, payoffs, and legal threats to suppress their accounts. Asia Argento, an Italian film actress and director, said that she did not speak out until now\u2014Weinstein, she told me, forcibly performed oral sex on her\u2014because she feared that Weinstein would \u201ccrush\u201d her. \u201cI know he has crushed a lot of people before,\u201d Argento said. \u201cThat\u2019s why this story\u2014in my case, it\u2019s twenty years old, some of them are older\u2014has never come out.\u201d On October 5th, the New York Times, in a powerful report by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, revealed multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Weinstein, an article that led to the resignation of four members of the Weinstein Company\u2019s all-male board, and to Weinstein\u2019s firing. The story, however, is complex, and there is more to know and to understand. In the course of a ten-month investigation, I was told by thirteen women that, between the nineteen-nineties and 2015, Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them. Their allegations corroborate and overlap with the Times\u2019s revelations, and also include far more serious claims. Three of the women\u2014among them Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Evans\u2014told me that Weinstein had raped them, forcibly performing or receiving oral sex or forcing vaginal sex. Four women said that they had experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault. In an audio recording captured during a New York Police Department sting operation in 2015, Weinstein admits to groping a Filipina-Italian model named Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, describing it as behavior he is \u201cused to.\u201d Four of the women I interviewed cited encounters in which Weinstein exposed himself or masturbated in front of them. Sixteen former and current executives and assistants at Weinstein\u2019s companies told me that they witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances and touching at events associated with Weinstein\u2019s films and in the workplace. They and others described a pattern of professional meetings that were little more than thin pretexts for sexual advances on young actresses and models. All sixteen said that the behavior was widely known within both Miramax and the Weinstein Company. Messages sent by Irwin Reiter, a senior company executive, to Emily Nestor, one of the women who alleged that she was harassed, described the \u201cmistreatment of women\u201d as a serial problem that the Weinstein Company had been struggling with in recent years. Other employees described what was, in essence, a culture of complicity at Weinstein\u2019s places of business, with numerous people throughout his companies fully aware of his behavior but either abetting it or looking the other way. Some employees said that they were enlisted in a subterfuge to make the victims feel safe. A female executive with the company described how Weinstein\u2019s assistants and others served as a \u201choneypot\u201d\u2014they would initially join a meeting along with a woman Weinstein was interested in, but then Weinstein would dismiss them, leaving him alone with the woman. (On October 10th, the Weinstein Company\u2019s board issued a statement, writing that \u201cthese allegations come as an utter surprise to the Board. Any suggestion that the Board had knowledge of this conduct is false.\u201d) Virtually all of the people I spoke with told me that they were frightened of retaliation. \u201cIf Harvey were to discover my identity, I\u2019m worried that he could ruin my life,\u201d one former employee told me. Many said that they had seen Weinstein\u2019s associates confront and intimidate those who crossed him, and feared that they would be similarly targeted. Four actresses, including Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette, told me they suspected that, after they rejected Weinstein\u2019s advances or complained about them to company representatives, Weinstein had them removed from projects or dissuaded people from hiring them. Multiple sources said that Weinstein frequently bragged about planting items in media outlets about those who spoke against him; these sources feared similar retribution. Several pointed to Gutierrez\u2019s case: after she went to the police, negative items discussing her sexual history and impugning her credibility began rapidly appearing in New York gossip pages. (In the taped conversation, part of which The New Yorker posted online, Weinstein asks Gutierrez to join him for \u201cfive minutes,\u201d and warns, \u201cDon\u2019t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.\u201d) Several former employees told me that they were speaking about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior now because they hoped to protect women in the future. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a one-off. This wasn\u2019t a period of time,\u201d an executive who worked for Weinstein for many years told me. \u201cThis was ongoing predatory behavior toward women\u2014whether they consented or not.\u201d It\u2019s likely that the women who spoke to me have recently felt increasingly emboldened to talk about their experiences because of the way the world has changed regarding issues of sex and power. Their disclosures follow in the wake of stories alleging sexual misconduct by public figures, including Donald Trump, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Roger Ailes, and Bill Cosby. In October, 2016, a month before the election, a tape emerged of Trump telling a celebrity-news reporter, \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. . . . Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d This past April, O\u2019Reilly, a host at Fox News, was forced to resign after Fox was discovered to have paid five women millions of dollars in exchange for silence about their accusations of sexual harassment. Ailes, the former head of Fox News, resigned in July, 2016, after he was accused of sexual harassment. Cosby went on trial this summer, charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman. The trial ended with a hung jury. In the Times piece, Weinstein made an initial effort at damage control by partly acknowledging what he had done, saying, \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.\u201d In an interview with the New York Post, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to deal with my personality, I\u2019ve got to work on my temper, I have got to dig deep. I know a lot of people would like me to go into a facility, and I may well just do that\u2014I will go anywhere I can learn more about myself.\u201d He went on, \u201cIn the past I used to compliment people, and some took it as me being sexual, I won\u2019t do that again.\u201d In his written statement to the Times, Weinstein claimed that he would \u201cchannel that anger\u201d into a fight against the leadership of the National Rifle Association. He also said that it was not \u201ccoincidental\u201d that he was organizing a foundation for women directors at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt will be named after my mom and I won\u2019t disappoint her.\u201d (U.S.C. has since rejected his funding pledge.) Sallie Hofmeister, a spokesperson for Weinstein, issued a new statement in response to the allegations detailed here. It reads in full: \u201cAny allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can\u2019t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.\u201d While Weinstein and his representatives have said that the incidents were consensual, and were not widespread or severe, the women I spoke to tell a very different story. 2.\n\nLucia Stoller, now Lucia Evans, was approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004, the summer before her senior year at Middlebury College. Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having an assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. \u201cI was, like, Oh, a woman, great, I feel safe,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou sold our cow for magical beanbags?\u201d When Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it, and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Evans said that she found him frightening. \u201cThe type of control he exerted\u2014it was very real,\u201d she told me. \u201cEven just his presence was intimidating.\u201d In the meeting, Evans recalled, \u201che immediately was simultaneously flattering me and demeaning me and making me feel bad about myself.\u201d Weinstein told her that she\u2019d \u201cbe great in \u2018Project Runway\u2019 \u201d\u2014the show, which Weinstein helped produce, premi\u00e8red later that year\u2014but only if she lost weight. He also told her about two scripts, a horror movie and a teen love story, and said one of his associates would discuss them with her. \u201cAt that point, after that, is when he assaulted me,\u201d Evans said. \u201cHe forced me to perform oral sex on him.\u201d As she objected, Weinstein took his penis out of his pants and pulled her head down onto it. \u201cI said, over and over, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, stop, don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cI tried to get away, but maybe I didn\u2019t try hard enough. I didn\u2019t want to kick him or fight him.\u201d In the end, she said, \u201che\u2019s a big guy. He overpowered me.\u201d She added, \u201cI just sort of gave up. That\u2019s the most horrible part of it, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to do this for so long to so many women: people give up, and then they feel like it\u2019s their fault.\u201d Weinstein appeared to find the encounter unremarkable. \u201cIt was like it was just another day for him,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt was no emotion.\u201d Afterward, he acted as if nothing had happened. She wondered how Weinstein\u2019s staff could not know what was going on. Following the encounter, she met with the female casting executive, who sent her the scripts, and also came to one of her acting-class readings a few weeks later. (Evans does not believe that the executive was aware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior.) Weinstein, Evans said, began calling her again late at night. She told me that the entire sequence of events had a routine quality. \u201cIt feels like a very streamlined process,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale casting director, Harvey wants to meet. Everything was designed to make me feel comfortable before it happened. And then the shame in what happened was also designed to keep me quiet.\u201d Evans said that, after the incident, \u201cI just put it in a part of my brain and closed the door.\u201d She continued to blame herself for not fighting harder. \u201cIt was always my fault for not stopping him,\u201d she said. \u201cI had an eating problem for years. I was disgusted with myself. It\u2019s funny, all these unrelated things I did to hurt myself because of this one thing.\u201d Evans told friends some of what had happened, but felt largely unable to talk about it. \u201cI ruined several really good relationships because of this. My schoolwork definitely suffered, and my roommates told me to go to a therapist because they thought I was going to kill myself.\u201d In the years that followed, Evans encountered Weinstein occasionally. Once, while she was walking her dog in Greenwich Village, she saw him getting into a car. \u201cI very clearly saw him. I made eye contact,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember getting chills down my spine just looking at him. I was so horrified. I have nightmares about him to this day.\u201d 3.\n\nAsia Argento, who was born in Rome, played the role of a glamorous thief named Beatrice in the crime drama \u201cB. Monkey,\u201d which was released in the U.S. in 1999. The distributor was Miramax. In a series of long and often emotional interviews, Argento told me that Weinstein assaulted her while they were working together. At the time, Argento was twenty-one and had twice won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar. Argento said that, in 1997, one of Weinstein\u2019s producers invited her to what she understood to be a party thrown by Miramax at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc, on the French Riviera. Argento felt professionally obliged to attend. When the producer led her upstairs that evening, she said, there was no party, only a hotel room, empty but for Weinstein: \u201cI\u2019m, like, \u2018Where is the fucking party?\u2019 \u201d She recalled the producer telling her, \u201cOh, we got here too early,\u201d before he left her alone with Weinstein. (The producer denies bringing Argento to the room that night.) At first, Weinstein was solicitous, praising her work. Then he left the room. When he returned, he was wearing a bathrobe and holding a bottle of lotion. \u201cHe asks me to give a massage. I was, like, \u2018Look, man, I am no fucking fool,\u2019 \u201d Argento told me. \u201cBut, looking back, I am a fucking fool. And I am still trying to come to grips with what happened.\u201d Argento said that, after she reluctantly agreed to give Weinstein a massage, he pulled her skirt up, forced her legs apart, and performed oral sex on her as she repeatedly told him to stop. Weinstein \u201cterrified me, and he was so big,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t stop. It was a nightmare.\u201d At some point, she stopped saying no and feigned enjoyment, because she thought it was the only way the assault would end. \u201cI was not willing,\u201d she told me. \u201cI said, \u2018No, no, no.\u2019 . . . It\u2019s twisted. A big fat man wanting to eat you. It\u2019s a scary fairy tale.\u201d Argento, who insisted that she wanted to tell her story in all its complexity, said that she didn\u2019t physically fight him off, something that has prompted years of guilt. \u201cThe thing with being a victim is I felt responsible,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause, if I were a strong woman, I would have kicked him in the balls and run away. But I didn\u2019t. And so I felt responsible.\u201d She described the incident as a \u201chorrible trauma.\u201d Decades later, she said, oral sex is still ruined for her. \u201cI\u2019ve been damaged,\u201d she told me. \u201cJust talking to you about it, my whole body is shaking.\u201d Argento recalled sitting on the bed after the incident, her clothes \u201cin shambles,\u201d her makeup smeared. She said that she told Weinstein, \u201cI am not a whore,\u201d and that he began laughing. He said he would put the phrase on a T-shirt. Afterward, Argento said, \u201cHe kept contacting me.\u201d For a few months, Weinstein seemed obsessed, offering her expensive gifts. What complicates the story, Argento readily allowed, is that she eventually yielded to Weinstein\u2019s further advances and even grew close to him. Weinstein dined with her, and introduced her to his mother. Argento told me, \u201cHe made it sound like he was my friend and he really appreciated me.\u201d She said that she had consensual sexual relations with him multiple times over the course of the next five years, though she described the encounters as one-sided and \u201conanistic.\u201d The first occasion, several months after the alleged assault, came before the release of \u201cB. Monkey.\u201d \u201cI felt I had to,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I had the movie coming out and I didn\u2019t want to anger him.\u201d She believed that Weinstein would ruin her career if she didn\u2019t comply. Years later, when she was a single mother dealing with childcare, Weinstein offered to pay for a nanny. She said that she felt \u201cobliged\u201d to submit to his sexual advances. Argento told me that she knew this contact would be used to attack the credibility of her allegation. In part, she said, the initial assault made her feel overpowered each time she encountered Weinstein, even years later. \u201cJust his body, his presence, his face, bring me back to the little girl that I was when I was twenty-one,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak.\u201d She broke down as she struggled to explain. \u201cAfter the rape, he won,\u201d she said. In 2000, Argento released \u201cScarlet Diva,\u201d a movie that she wrote and directed. In the film, a heavyset producer corners Anna, the character played by Argento, in a hotel room, asks her for a massage, and tries to assault her. After the movie came out, women began approaching Argento, saying that they recognized Weinstein\u2019s behavior in the portrayal. \u201cPeople would ask me about him because of the scene in the movie,\u201d she said. Some recounted similar details to her: meetings and professional events moved to hotel rooms, bathrobes and massage requests, and, in one other case, forced oral sex. Weinstein, according to Argento, saw the film after it was released in the U.S., and apparently recognized himself. \u201cHa, ha, very funny,\u201d Argento remembered him saying to her. But he also said that he was \u201csorry for whatever happened.\u201d The movie\u2019s most significant departure from the real-life incident, Argento told me, was how the hotel-room scene ended. \u201cIn the movie I wrote,\u201d she said, \u201cI ran away.\u201d Other women were too afraid to allow me to use their names, but their stories are uncannily similar to these allegations. One, a woman who worked with Weinstein, explained her reluctance to be identified. \u201cHe drags your name through the mud, and he\u2019ll come after you hard with his legal team.\u201d Like others I spoke to, this woman said that Weinstein brought her to a hotel room under a professional pretext, changed into a bathrobe, and, she said, \u201cforced himself on me sexually.\u201d She told him no, repeatedly and clearly. Afterward, she experienced \u201chorror, disbelief, and shame,\u201d and considered going to the police. \u201cI thought it would be a \u2018he said, she said,\u2019 and I thought about how impressive his legal team is, and I thought about how much I would lose, and I decided to just move forward,\u201d she said. The woman continued to have professional contact with Weinstein after the alleged rape, and acknowledged that subsequent communications between them might suggest a normal working relationship. \u201cI was in a vulnerable position and I needed my job,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt just increases the shame and the guilt.\u201d 4.\n\nMira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein\u2019s films, told me that he sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship while they were working together. She said that, at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, 1995, she found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein, who produced the movie she was there to promote, \u201cMighty Aphrodite,\u201d for which she later won an Academy Award. \u201cHe started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,\u201d she recalled. She scrambled for ways to ward him off, telling him that it was against her religion to date married men. (At the time, Weinstein was married to Eve Chilton, a former assistant.) Then she left the room. A few weeks later, in New York City, her phone rang after midnight. It was Weinstein, saying that he had new marketing ideas for the film and asking to get together. Sorvino offered to meet him at an all-night diner, but he said he was coming over to her apartment and hung up. \u201cI freaked out,\u201d she told me. She called a friend and asked him to come over and pose as her boyfriend. The friend hadn\u2019t arrived by the time Weinstein rang her doorbell. \u201cHarvey had managed to bypass my doorman,\u201d she said. \u201cI opened the door terrified, brandishing my twenty-pound Chihuahua mix in front of me, as though that would do any good.\u201d When she told Weinstein that her new boyfriend was on his way, he became dejected and left. Sorvino said that she struggled for years with whether to come forward with her story, partly because she was aware that it was mild compared with the experiences of other women, including Sophie Dix, an actress she spoke to at the time. (Dix told me that she had locked herself in a hotel bathroom to escape Weinstein, and that he had masturbated in front of her. She said it was \u201ca classic case\u201d of \u201csomeone not understanding the word \u2018no.\u2019 . . . I must have said no a thousand times.\u201d) The fact that Weinstein was so instrumental in Sorvino\u2019s success also made her hesitate: \u201cI have great respect for Harvey as an artist, and owe him and his brother a debt of gratitude for the early success in my career, including the Oscar.\u201d She had professional contact with Weinstein for years after the incident, and remains a close friend of his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein. (She never told Bob about his brother\u2019s behavior.) Sorvino said that she felt afraid and intimidated, and that the incidents had a significant impact on her. When she told a female employee at Miramax about the harassment, the woman\u2019s reaction \u201cwas shock and horror that I had mentioned it.\u201d Sorvino appeared in a few more of Weinstein\u2019s films afterward, but felt that saying no to Weinstein and reporting the harassment had ultimately hurt her career. She said, \u201cThere may have been other factors, but I definitely felt iced out and that my rejection of Harvey had something to do with it.\u201d 5.\n\nIn March, 2015, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who was once a finalist in the Miss Italy contest, met Harvey Weinstein at a reception for \u201cNew York Spring Spectacular,\u201d a show that he was producing at Radio City Music Hall. Weinstein introduced himself to Gutierrez, who was twenty-two, remarking repeatedly that she looked like the actress Mila Kunis. Following the event, Gutierrez\u2019s modelling agency e-mailed her to say that Weinstein wanted to set up a business meeting as soon as possible. Gutierrez arrived at Weinstein\u2019s office in Tribeca early the next evening with her modelling portfolio. In the office, she sat with Weinstein on a couch to review the portfolio, and he began staring at her breasts, asking if they were real. Gutierrez later told officers of the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Division that Weinstein then lunged at her, groping her breasts and attempting to put a hand up her skirt while she protested. He finally backed off and told her that his assistant would give her tickets to \u201cFinding Neverland,\u201d a Broadway musical that he was producing. He said he would meet her at the show that evening. \u201cWhen you\u2019re President, then you can watch six hours of television a day.\u201d Instead of going to the show, Gutierrez went to the nearest police station and reported the assault. Weinstein telephoned her later that evening, annoyed that she had failed to appear at the show. She picked up the call while sitting with investigators from the Special Victims Division, who listened in and devised a plan: Gutierrez would agree to see the show the following day and then meet with Weinstein. She would wear a wire and attempt to extract a confession or an incriminating statement. The next day, Gutierrez met Weinstein at the bar of the Tribeca Grand Hotel. A team of undercover officers helped guide her through the interaction. On the recording, which I have heard in full, Weinstein lists actresses whose careers he has helped and offers Gutierrez the services of a dialect coach. Then he presses her to join him in his hotel room while he showers. Gutierrez says no repeatedly; Weinstein persists, and after a while she accedes to his demand to go upstairs. But, standing in the hallway outside his room, she refuses to go farther. In an increasingly tense exchange, he presses her to enter. Gutierrez says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d \u201cI want to leave,\u201d and \u201cI want to go downstairs.\u201d She asks him directly why he groped her breasts the day before. \u201cOh, please, I\u2019m sorry, just come on in,\u201d Weinstein says. \u201cI\u2019m used to that. Come on. Please.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re used to that?\u201d Gutierrez asks, sounding incredulous. \u201cYes,\u201d Weinstein says. He adds, \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d After almost two minutes of back-and-forth in the hallway, Weinstein finally agrees to let her leave. According to a law-enforcement source, Weinstein, if charged, would most likely have faced a count of sexual abuse in the third degree, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of three months in jail. But, as the police investigation proceeded and the allegation was widely reported, details about Gutierrez\u2019s past began to appear in the tabloids. In 2010, as a young contestant in the Miss Italy beauty pageant, Gutierrez had attended one of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s infamous \u201cBunga Bunga\u201d parties. She claimed that she had been unaware of the nature of the party before arriving, and she eventually became a witness in a bribery case against Berlusconi, which is still ongoing. Gossip outlets also reported that Gutierrez, as a teen-ager, had made an allegation of sexual assault against an older Italian businessman but later declined to co\u00f6perate with prosecutors. Two sources close to the police investigation of Weinstein said that they had no reason to doubt Gutierrez\u2019s account of the incident. One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. But the other said that Gutierrez\u2019s statements about her past complicated the case for the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr. After two weeks of investigation, the D.A.\u2019s office decided not to file charges. The office declined to comment on this story but pointed me to its statement at the time: \u201cThis case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.\u201d \u201cWe had the evidence,\u201d the police source involved in the operation told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a case that made me angrier than I thought possible, and I have been on the force a long time.\u201d Gutierrez, when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Someone close to the matter told me that, after the D.A.\u2019s office decided not to press charges, Gutierrez, facing Weinstein\u2019s legal team, and in return for a payment, signed a highly restrictive nondisclosure agreement with Weinstein, including an affidavit stating that the acts he admits to in the recording never happened. Weinstein\u2019s use of such settlements was reported by the Times and confirmed to me by numerous people. A former employee with firsthand knowledge of two settlement negotiations that took place in London in the nineteen-nineties recalled, \u201cIt felt like David versus Goliath . . . the guy with all the money and the power flexing his muscle and quashing the allegations and getting rid of them.\u201d 6.\n\nThe Times story disclosed a complaint to the Weinstein Company\u2019s office of human resources, filed on behalf of a temporary front-desk assistant named Emily Nestor in December, 2014. Her own account of Weinstein\u2019s conduct is being made public here for the first time. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. On her first day in the position, Nestor said, two employees told her that she was Weinstein\u2019s \u201ctype\u201d physically. When Weinstein arrived at the office, he made comments about her appearance, referring to her as \u201cthe pretty girl.\u201d He asked how old she was, and then sent all of his assistants out of the room and made her write down her telephone number. Weinstein told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. When he insisted, she suggested an early-morning coffee the next day, assuming that he wouldn\u2019t accept. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. Nestor said that she had talked with friends in the entertainment industry and employees in the company who had warned her about Weinstein\u2019s reputation. \u201cI dressed very frumpy,\u201d she said. Nestor told me that the meeting was \u201cthe most excruciating and uncomfortable hour of my life.\u201d After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know, we could have a lot of fun,\u2019 \u201d Nestor recalled. \u201c \u2018I could put you in my London office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.\u2019 \u201d She declined. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. In Nestor\u2019s account of the exchange, Weinstein said, \u201cOh, the girls always say no. You know, \u2018No, no.\u2019 And then they have a beer or two and then they\u2019re throwing themselves at me.\u201d In a tone that Nestor described as \u201cvery weirdly proud,\u201d Weinstein added \u201cthat he\u2019d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.\u201d She assumed that he meant he\u2019d never drugged a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bizarre thing to be so proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you\u2019ve never had to resort to doing that. It was just so far removed from reality and normal rules of consent.\u201d \u201cTextbook sexual harassment\u201d was how Nestor described Weinstein\u2019s behavior to me. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty clear case of sexual harassment when your superior, the C.E.O., asks one of their inferiors, a temp, to have sex with them, essentially in exchange for mentorship.\u201d She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. \u201c \u2018No\u2019 did not mean \u2018no\u2019 to him,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very aware of how inappropriate it was. But I felt trapped.\u201d Throughout the breakfast, she said, Weinstein interrupted their conversation to yell into his cell phone, enraged over a spat that Amy Adams, a star in the Weinstein movie \u201cBig Eyes,\u201d was having in the press. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. Later in the day, there were indeed negative news items about his opponents, and Weinstein stopped by Nestor\u2019s desk to be sure that she\u2019d seen them. By that point, Nestor recalled, \u201cI was very afraid of him. And I knew how well connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I could never have a career in that industry.\u201d Still, she told a friend about the incident, and he alerted the company\u2019s office of human resources, which contacted her. (The friend did not respond to a request for comment.) Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn\u2019t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in businesses the size of the Weinstein Company. Several former Weinstein employees told me that the company\u2019s human-resources department was utterly ineffective; one female executive described it as \u201ca place where you went to when you didn\u2019t want anything to get done. That was common knowledge across the board. Because everything funnelled back to Harvey.\u201d She described the department\u2019s typical response to allegations of misconduct as \u201cThis is his company. If you don\u2019t like it, you can leave.\u201d Nestor told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. \u201cWe view this very seriously and I personally am very sorry your first day was like this,\u201d Reiter wrote. \u201cAlso if there are further unwanted advances, please let us know.\u201d Last year, just before the Presidential election, he reached out again, writing, \u201cAll this Trump stuff made me think of you.\u201d He described Nestor\u2019s experience as part of Weinstein\u2019s serial misconduct. \u201cI\u2019ve fought him about mistreatment of women 3 weeks before the incident with you. I even wrote him an email that got me labelled by him as sex police,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fight I had with him about you was epic. I told him if you were my daughter he would have not made out so well.\u201d (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. Katz also noted that Reiter \u201cis eager to co\u00f6perate fully with any outside investigation.\u201d) Though no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. \u201cI was definitely traumatized for a while, in terms of feeling so harassed and frightened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me feel incredibly discouraged that this could be something that happens on a regular basis. I actually decided not to go into entertainment because of this incident.\u201d 7.\n\nEmma de Caunes, a French actress, met Weinstein in 2010, at a party at the Cannes Film Festival. A few months later, he asked her to a lunch meeting at the H\u00f4tel Ritz, in Paris. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. It was an adaptation of a book, he said, but he claimed he couldn\u2019t remember the title. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d Weinstein said, according to de Caunes. \u201cI have it in my room.\u201d De Caunes replied that she had to leave, since she was already running late for a TV show she was hosting\u2014Eminem was appearing on the show that afternoon, and she hadn\u2019t written her questions yet. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. She assumed that he was washing his hands. \u201cWhen I hung up the phone, I heard the shower go on in the bathroom,\u201d she said. \u201cI was, like, What the fuck, is he taking a shower?\u201d Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. Weinstein demanded that she lie on the bed and told her that many other women had done so before her. \u201cI was very petrified,\u201d de Caunes said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to show him that I was petrified, because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.\u201d She added, \u201cIt was like a hunter with a wild animal. The fear turns him on.\u201d De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d she remembered him saying. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a Walt Disney movie!\u201d De Caunes told me, \u201cI looked at him and I said\u2014it took all my courage, but I said, \u2018I\u2019ve always hated Walt Disney movies.\u2019 And then I left. I slammed the door.\u201d She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Weinstein called relentlessly over the next few hours, offering de Caunes gifts and repeating his assertion that nothing had happened. De Caunes, who was in her early thirties at the time, was already an established actress, but she wondered what would happen to younger and more vulnerable women in the same situation. Over the years, she said, she\u2019s heard similar accounts from friends. \u201cI know that everybody\u2014I mean everybody\u2014in Hollywood knows that it\u2019s happening,\u201d de Caunes said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, so many people are involved and see what\u2019s happening. But everyone\u2019s too scared to say anything.\u201d 8.\n\nOne evening in the early nineties, the actress Rosanna Arquette was supposed to meet Weinstein for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up the script for a new film. At the hotel, Arquette was told to meet Weinstein upstairs, in his room. Arquette recalled that, when she arrived at the room, Weinstein opened the door wearing a white bathrobe. He said that his neck was sore and that he needed a massage. She told him that she could recommend a good masseuse. \u201cThen he grabbed my hand,\u201d she said. He put it on his neck. When she yanked her hand away, Weinstein grabbed it again and pulled it toward his penis, which was visible and erect. \u201cMy heart was really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight moment,\u201d she said. She told Weinstein, \u201cI will never do that.\u201d Weinstein told her that she was making a huge mistake by rejecting him, and named an actress and a model who he claimed had given in to his sexual overtures and whose careers he said he had advanced as a result. Arquette said she responded, \u201cI\u2019ll never be that girl,\u201d and left. Arquette said that after she rejected Weinstein her career suffered. In one case, she believes, she lost a role because of it. \u201cHe made things very difficult for me for years,\u201d she told me. She did appear in one subsequent Weinstein film\u2014\u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d Arquette believes that she only got that role because of its small size and Weinstein\u2019s deference to the filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino. (Disputes later arose over her entitlement to payment out of the film\u2019s proceeds.) Arquette said that her silence was the result of Weinstein\u2019s power and reputation for vindictiveness. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be working very hard to track people down and silence people,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo hurt people. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d There are other examples of Weinstein\u2019s using the same modus operandi. Jessica Barth, an actress who met him at a Golden Globes party in January, 2011, told me that he invited her to a business meeting at the Peninsula. When she arrived, he asked her over the phone to go up to his room. Weinstein assured her it was \u201cno big deal\u201d\u2014because of his high profile, he simply wanted privacy to \u201ctalk career stuff.\u201d In the room, she found that Weinstein had ordered champagne and sushi. Barth said that, in the conversation that followed, Weinstein alternated between offering to cast her in a film and demanding a naked massage in bed. \u201cSo, what would happen if, say, we\u2019re having some champagne and I take my clothes off and you give me a massage?\u201d she recalled him asking. \u201cAnd I\u2019m, like, \u2018That\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 \u201d When she moved toward the door to leave, Weinstein lashed out, saying that she needed to lose weight \u201cto compete with Mila Kunis,\u201d and then, apparently in an effort to mollify her, promising a meeting with one of his female executives. \u201cHe gave me her number, and I walked out and I started bawling,\u201d Barth told me. (Immediately after the incident, she spoke with two people; they confirmed to me that she had described her experience to them at the time.) Barth said that the promised meeting at Weinstein\u2019s office seemed to be purely a formality. \u201cI just knew it was bullshit,\u201d she said. (The executive she met with did not respond to requests for comment.) 9.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s behavior deeply affected the day-to-day operations of his companies. Current and former employees described a pattern of meetings and strained complicity that closely matches the accounts of the many women I interviewed. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity because, they said, they feared for their careers in Hollywood and because of provisos in their work contracts. \u201cThere was a large volume of these types of meetings that Harvey would have with aspiring actresses and models,\u201d one female executive told me. \u201cHe would have them late at night, usually at hotel bars or in hotel rooms. And, in order to make these women feel more comfortable, he would ask a female executive or assistant to start those meetings with him.\u201d She was repeatedly asked to join such meetings, she said, but she refused. The executive said that she was especially disturbed by the involvement of other employees. \u201cIt almost felt like the executive or assistant was made to be a honeypot to lure these women in, to make them feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThen he would dismiss the executive or the assistant, and then these women were alone with him. And that did not feel like it was appropriate behavior or safe behavior.\u201d One former employee told me that she was frequently asked to join for the beginning of meetings that, she said, had in many cases already been moved from day to night and from hotel lobbies to hotel rooms. She said that Weinstein\u2019s conduct in the meetings was brazen. During a meeting with a model, the former employee said, he turned to her and demanded, \u201cTell her how good of a boyfriend I am.\u201d She said that when she refused to join one such meeting, Weinstein became enraged. Often, she was asked to keep track of the women, who, in keeping with a practice established by Weinstein\u2019s assistants, were all filed under the same label in her phone: F.O.H., which stood for \u201cFriend of Harvey.\u201d She added that the pattern of meetings was nearly uninterrupted in her years of working for Weinstein. \u201cI have to say, the behavior did stop for a little bit after the groping thing,\u201d she told me, referring to Gutierrez\u2019s allegation to the police. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t help himself. A few months later, he was back at it.\u201d Two staffers who facilitated these meetings said that they felt morally compromised by them. One male former staffer noted that many of the women seemed \u201cnot aware of the nature of those meetings\u201d and \u201cwere definitely scared.\u201d He told me that most of the encounters that he saw seemed consensual, but others gave him pause. He was especially troubled by his memory of one young woman: \u201cYou just feel terrible because you could tell this girl, very young, not from our country, was now in a room waiting for him to come up there in the middle of the day, and we were not to bother them.\u201d He said that he was never asked to facilitate these meetings for men. None of the former executives or assistants I spoke to quit because of the misconduct, but many expressed guilt and regret over not having said or done more. They talked about what they believed to be a culture of silence about sexual assault inside Miramax and the Weinstein Company and across the entertainment industry more broadly. 10.", "description": "Ronan Farrow reports the stories of thirteen women who say that, between the nineteen-nineties and 2015, Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.", "authors": ["Ronan Farrow", "Masha Gessen", "Hua Hsu", "Helen Rosner"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59dcaf1b88b92647800a95f5/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Farrow-Weinstein-ARTICLE.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-10"}
