Republicans who are members of the three congressional committees conducting the inquiry have taken part in the process throughout.\n\nAfter a delay of about four hours, Cooper began her testimony.\n\nIt was a dramatic confrontation in the House of Representatives inquiry that threatens Republican Trump's presidency even as he seeks re-election next year.\n\nDemocrats are investigating whether there are grounds to impeach Trump over his July 25 request in a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nZelenskiy agreed during the call. U.S. security aid that had been approved by the U.S. Congress but was being withheld from Ukraine was later provided.\n\nFederal election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nThe content of the phone call was revealed by a whistleblower complaint against Trump by a person in a U.S. intelligence agency.\n\nThe top Republicans on the three committees sent a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday calling on him to have the whistleblower testify publicly. They said Schiff had decided that the committees would not hear the whistleblower's testimony. A Schiff spokesman declined to comment.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter had said negotiations for the whistleblower's testimony were complicated. Trump had suggested the person committed treason, leading Democrats to worry that their testimony could put them at risk of exposure.\n\n'FAIR AND OPEN PROCESS'\n\nBy having Republican lawmakers barge into the hearing room, Trump's allies sought to put the focus on what they portray as unfair Democratic tactics rather than on the president's conduct.\n\nLate on Wednesday, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, who led the confrontation, told reporters, \"There are going to be other things done to push even harder to have a fair and open process.\"\n\nAlthough the Republicans complained of a lack of transparency in the inquiry, the U.S. constitution gives the House wide latitude in how to conduct the impeachment process and set rules for the probe. It is being held in a secure room used to brief lawmakers about confidential or sensitive material.\n\n\"They're freaked out. They're trying to stop this investigation,\" Democratic Representative Ted Lieu said of the Republicans. \"They know more facts are going to be delivered which are absolutely damning to the president of the United States.\"\n\nRepublicans brought cellphones into the facility even though electronic devices are forbidden and an Intelligence Committee official said some refused to remove them. The House parliamentarian ruled that the Republican lawmakers violated House rules, the official added.\n\nSchiff told reporters that the witnesses testifying in the inquiry have defied the White House efforts to keep them silent and that \"the president has urged his acolytes in Congress to use other means to try to prevent their testimony. But they won't be successful.\"\n\nTrump on Monday told reporters that \"Republicans have to get tougher and fight\" the impeachment, saying the Democrats are\"vicious and they stick together.\"\n\nTrump also criticized his Republican critics on Twitter, writing: \"The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\"\n\nBefore the hearing room was stormed, dozens of House Republicans appeared before reporters denouncing the impeachment process as a \"joke,\" a \"railroad job,\" a \"charade\" and\"Soviet-style.\" They complained that testimony was being taken privately rather than in public hearings and that the House did not hold a vote formally authorizing the investigation.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, began testifying on Wednesday afternoon after the standoff ended, an Intelligence Committee official said. Cooper was expected to face questions about Trump's decision this year to withhold $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nCooper had initially agreed to testify voluntarily but after pushback from the Pentagon was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee early on Wednesday, according to an official working on the impeachment probe.\n\nIn an Oct. 22 letter to Cooper's attorney that was seen by Reuters, the Pentagon suggested Cooper could not be \"sanctioned for refusing to comply\" with a subpoena and reminded her of White House guidance that personnel could not participate in the inquiry.\n\nIn testimony on Tuesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, said Trump had made aid contingent on the Ukrainian president announcing he would investigate Biden, his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nSo far, few Republicans have appeared inclined toward Trump's removal, though there have been some cracks in their support. Senator John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, told reporters that the picture painted by Taylor's testimony \"based on the reporting that we've seen is not a good one.\"\n\nThe inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges known as articles of impeachment, prompting a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers hope to complete the impeachment inquiry by year's end and are coalescing around two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction, lawmakers and aides told Reuters.\n\nDemocratic Representative David Cicilline told reporters that holding the depositions in private protects the integrity of the inquiry.\n\n\"One of the reasons you do these in private is because you want to prevent witnesses from attempting to align their testimony to the testimony of another witness by watching it or reading a transcript. It's how you protect the integrity of any investigation,\" Cicilline said.\n\nDemocratic Representative Eric Swalwell added, \"We see this as an effort not only to intimidate this witness but also to intimidate future witnesses from coming forward. It's not going to work. We're not going to be deterred.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows told reporters after Cooper's testimony that he wanted to hear from more witnesses with \"first-hand knowledge\" of the events.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "A U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry devolved into chaos on Wednesday as Republican lawmakers, encouraged by President Donald Trump to get tougher in fighting Democratic efforts to impeach him over dealings with Ukraine, stormed into a high-security hearing room and delayed testimony by a witness.
