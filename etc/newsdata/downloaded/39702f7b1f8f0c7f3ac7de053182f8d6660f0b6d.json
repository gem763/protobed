But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.\n\nAD\n\nCareer diplomats also include William Burns, former assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Russia under Bush, and deputy secretary under Obama; Nancy McEldowney, former Bush ambassador to Bulgaria and deputy chief of mission to Turkey; and Jeffrey Feltman, who served in senior State Department positions beginning in the George H.W. Bush administration and for nearly six years as undersecretary general at the United Nations until his 2018 retirement.\n\nFormer officials from the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security also signed the statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs national security professionals, many of us have long been concerned with President Trump\u2019s actions and their implications for our safety and security,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSome of us have spoken out, but many of us have eschewed politics throughout our careers and, as a result, have not weighed in publicly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe revelations of recent days, however, demand a response,\u201d it said. \u201c. . . President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cIf we fail to speak up \u2014 and act \u2014 now our foreign policy and national security will officially be on offer to those who can most effectively fulfill the President\u2019s personal prerogatives.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In a signed statement, group supports impeachment inquiry to determine \u201cthe facts.\u201d", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kyt_Rrwnp6LNznkVK5E5D2t2gEk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XJ4PUSXA3EI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
