(AP) - One more win would give Mark Dantonio a share of the school record.\n\nThe Michigan State coach is in no mood to celebrate.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game of effort, toughness and knowing what to do. Half of our team figured that out, half of it didn\u2019t,\u201d Dantonio said Tuesday. \u201cWe will make sure that other half gets it figured out this week.\u201d\n\nThat statement set the tone at Dantonio\u2019s weekly news conference. Four days after the Spartans opened the season with a 28-7 win over Tulsa, he was clearly still concerned about the mistakes on offense that prevented Michigan State from a more decisive victory. Dantonio didn\u2019t raise his voice or lose his temper, but he was blunt when calling his team out for a variety of shortcomings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call it as I see it up here right now - going to send a message to our football team. We have a long season ahead of us. We can play much better than that,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cI was disappointed in the effort when I see guys running routes that are not at full speed. I see guys blocking at the point of attack, throwing a shoulder in there, not addressing a defender. Can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMichigan State held Tulsa to minus-73 yards rushing, but the Spartans scored only one offensive touchdown, and that was on the first drive of the game. Michigan State had 14 penalties for 122 yards. In the second quarter, the Spartans started three drives inside the Tulsa 40-yard line and settled for a field goal each time.\n\n\u201cWhen we see something that\u2019s not going correctly, going to try and adjust and make corrections,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to come in here and sandbag it or anything like that. I don\u2019t think I ever have. We need to get busy. You guys can all tweet that out.\u201d\n\nMichigan State dropped one spot to No. 19 in the latest AP Top 25. The Spartans host Western Michigan on Saturday night, and Dantonio is one victory shy of Duffy Daugherty\u2019s school record of 109. The record was not Dantonio\u2019s biggest concern Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s something that a lot of people have worked to do,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cWhen we get there, we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nMichigan State\u2019s offense was an issue coming into the season. Dantonio shifted roles around on his offensive staff, making Brad Salem the coordinator.\n\nSalem\u2019s first game in charge was underwhelming.\n\n\u201cIt was disappointing, because I thought we had a great fall camp, played very well in the scrimmages,\u201d Salem said. \u201cLights came on, we gotta go. And we know that.\u201d\n\nThe tension surrounding the offense\u2019s performance was evident Friday when there was some grumbling from the crowd at Spartan Stadium. In addition to all the times they settled for field goals, the Spartans were also stopped twice on fourth-and-short in the first half.\n\n\u201cThere were some good things on offense. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to finish. We were in the red zone two times on fourth-and-1. We\u2019ve got to get the 1 yard,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cYou get the 1 yard, you go in and score a touchdown, that game is probably 42-0 or 42-7 - everybody feels a little happier.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Dantonio was critical of his team, but he seemed even more displeased Tuesday. He said he expects the Spartans to be plenty motivated against WMU.\n\n\u201cI got to send a message, OK?\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I get a little irritable before I walk into these press conferences. I take it with me. Sometimes I get irritable walking out, OK? Take that with me, too.\u201d\n\nNotes: Dantonio said LS Ryan Armour is out for the season with an injury that requires surgery. \u2026 OL Cole Chewins is not listed on the depth chart this week. \u201cCole needs to practice full go before he can play. He\u2019s sort of in and out,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cHe\u2019s in that situation right now where he\u2019s got to practice full go before he can play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One more win would give Mark Dantonio a share of the school record.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/tulsa_michigan_st_football_84093_c0-466-5280-3544_s1770x1032.jpg?2ce763d036ce5b7c43f33253afa3e3529f629a32"}
