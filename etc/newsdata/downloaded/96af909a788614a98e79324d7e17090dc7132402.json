Kavanaugh.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nThe recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.\n\nThe story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d written by two Times staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a \u201cdrunken dorm party\u201d where \u201cfriends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book \u2014 and, according to friends, doesn\u2019t remember any such incident .\n\nSuch an oversight is inexcusable.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThe Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by the Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times writers, who said the details had been in the excerpt\u2019s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission, and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, \u201cin the haste\u201d of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.\n\nThe facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors, and apparently told friends that she doesn\u2019t recall any such incident, amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren\u2019t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.\n\nIndeed, the authors\u2019 only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times writers himself.\n\nSome Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBut let\u2019s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason the Times writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nRamirez, for her part, initially wasn\u2019t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told the New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.\n\nIf these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by are alleged victims who also were drinking at the time, and comments from former classmates \u2014 who may also have been inebriated \u2014 some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez\u2019s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez\u2019s mother, to whom she apparently said, \u201cSomething happened at Yale.\u201d\n\nNot exactly a wrap for justice.\n\nThe truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez\u2019s story was first reported by the New Yorker just days before Ford\u2019s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser , not only doesn\u2019t remember the party but says she\u2019s never even met Kavanaugh.\n\nWhat\u2019s all too clear is that America\u2019s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s, and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay \u2014 and impeachable journalism.\n\nkathleenparker@washpost.com\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Here\u2019s how to handle Kavanaugh\n\nOpinion: Dear Biden, Kavanaugh and Clinton: Apologies should not be this hard\n\nKathleen Parker: Donald Trump clearly won the Democratic debate\n\nHenry Olsen: Calls for impeaching Kavanaugh are damaging our democracy\n\nJennifer Rubin: This is the Kavanaugh mess we feared", "description": "The sources were as unreliable as the hazy \u201cmemories\u201d of those who allegedly witnessed the assault.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHrvGw.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2676&y=1561"}
