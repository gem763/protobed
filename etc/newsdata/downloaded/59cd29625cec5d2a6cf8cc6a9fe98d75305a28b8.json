Yes, it is in the offing, I can't deny that.'\n\nSources close to Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, fear that an unapologetic tale of her rise to fame and the royal family could create a divide between them and the other royals.\n\nTom Bower (left) has set his sights on a book about the Duchess of Sussex (pictured with husband Harry on their Africa tour right), as sources fear it could drive a wedge between her and the rest of the royal family\n\nThey said the idea would be making the Duchess 'very anxious' and likened it to an 'executioner sharpening their axe'.\n\nIt comes after Harry launched a ferocious attack on the press, claiming his wife is being subjected to the same 'powerful forces' his mother Diana had to contend with before her death.\n\nThe Duchess is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of her father's letters.\n\nThe couple are also taking legal action against the Sun and now defunct News of the World over phonehacking allegations.\n\nEarlier this year he suggested he is not entirely keen on the Duchess when he appeared on Good Morning Britain.\n\nHe told the ITV programme: 'The problem is in my view that she is trying to be Diana. She's trying to adopt that role.'\n\nHe added that somebody at the Palace needs to tell her: 'Look, this is the way it's done here.'\n\nMeghan is pictured on a visit to Tembisa township near Johannesburg, South Africa on October 2\n\nMr Bower said she 'doesn't deserve privacy', adding: 'She's on public display and when you're on public display 24/7 there has to be a certain way of behaving.'\n\nHe said in a separate interview: 'Harry is a decent sort of bloke, but he's easily influenced.\n\n'At the same time he's married a woman who is determined and very ambitious.'\n\nAmong Mr Bower's unauthorised biographies are: 'Dangerous hero: Corbyn's Ruthless Plot for Power' on the Labour leader, and Broken Vows: Tony Blair and the Tragedy of Power'.\n\nHis take on Meghan's father-in-law Prince Charles was that he is jealous of his son's popularity and out of touch.", "description": "Tom Bower, 73, is known for his scathing style after publishing blistering accounts of the lives of Prince Charles, Tony Blair, Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Branson.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19656734-0-image-a-57_1570976118283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
