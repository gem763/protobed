They are there to take part in the \u2018Slavic Shield 2019\u2019 joint military drill.\n\nIt is the first Russian-Serbian exercise of its kind, as well as the first time Moscow\u2019s state-of-the-art air defense missile systems have taken part in a drill abroad.\n\nSerbian troops had the opportunity to observe the S-400s in action last month, when the first phase of the drill was launched in southern Russia.\n\nThe countries share a long history of friendly relations and, despite being surrounded by NATO member states, Belgrade remains Russia\u2019s closest ally in the Balkans. Last year, Russia delivered jets, helicopters, tanks, APCs, and radars to Serbia. The country is currently expecting a delivery of Pantsir-S1s, while some of its politicians expressed interest in obtaining S-400s as well.\n\nS-400s were recently purchased by Turkey and India. Both states were pressured by the US to scrap the contracts but went ahead with the deals anyway.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH Russian Tu-160 nuclear-capable bombers land in South Africa (VIDEO)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
