They agreed to pay a lot more money for the United States.\"Considering Seoul has to keep in mind the importance of cooperation with Washington in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, this week's talks will likely be a tough grind for South Korea's team of negotiators.Kim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
