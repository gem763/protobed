This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "This week, This is Money takes a look at a raft of inter-generation financial divide stories that have popped up in August.\n\nThis includes why those born in the 1980s have less disposable income than those born in the 1970s according to the Office for National Statistics and why the Bank of Mum and Dad is creaking.\n\nAssistant editor Lee Boyce, reporter George Nixon and host Georgie Frost run the rule over these statistics, along with proposals to raise the state pension age to 75.\n\nThis was from a right-wing think tank The Centre for Social Justice and has left many industry experts irate.\n\nWe also discuss data showing that two thirds of older people say they feel hurt by the inter-generational financial criticism that they are lording it up at the expense of younger generations.\n\nElsewhere, why easy-access savings account rates could be a better bet than fixed-rate offers and why you should act if you have a Marcus Bank savings account.\n\nWe also talk metal bank cards \u2013 why on earth would you want one and who is offering them?", "description": "Assistant editor Lee Boyce, reporter George Nixon and host Georgie Frost run the rule over data potentially highlighting the inter-generation financial divide.", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
