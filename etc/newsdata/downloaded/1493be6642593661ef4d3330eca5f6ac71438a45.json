To Mexico. I think the questions raised by El Anti-Pozolero, below, might require more urgent attention than we seem to be able to muster these days. I cannot say whether he\u2019s right: I haven\u2019t set foot in Mexico in more than twenty years. But worthy of our thought? It sure looks that way from the news.\n\nYou may have read the news just a few days back: the Mexican military captured not one but two of El Chapo\u2019s sons in the heart of Culiac\u00e1n, the Sinaloan capital. One son freed himself\u2014which is to say his entourage and retainers at hand overpowered and killed the soldiers at hand\u2014and then, in a decisive riposte, seized the entire city center of Culiac\u00e1n to compel the liberation of his brother.\n\nThe forces that emerged were in the literal sense awesome and awful. Heavy weaponry that would be familiar on any Iraqi, Syrian, or Yemeni battlefield was brought to bear. More and worse: custom-built armored vehicles, designed and built to make a Sahel-warfare technical look like an amateur\u2019s weekend kit job, were rolled out for their combat debut. Most critically, all this hardware was manned by men with qualities the Mexican Army largely lacks: training, tactical proficiency, and motivation.\n\nThen the coup de grace: as the Chapo sons\u2019 forces engaged in direct combat with their own national military, kill squads went into action across Culiac\u00e1n, slaughtering the families of soldiers engaged in the streets.\n\nCowed and overmatched\u2014most crucially in the moral arena\u2014the hapless band of soldiers still holding the second son finally received word from Mexico City, direct from President AMLO himself: surrender. Surrender and release the prisoner.\n\nIt\u2019s an absolutely extraordinary episode even by the grim and bizarre annals of what we mistakenly call the post-2006 Mexican Drug War. The Battle of Culiac\u00e1n stands on a level above, say, the Ayotzinapa massacre, or the Zetas\u2019 expulsion of the entire population of Ciudad Mier. Killing scores of innocents and brutalizing small towns is one thing: seizing regional capital cities and crushing the national armed forces in open fighting in broad daylight is something else.\n\n\u201cDrug War\u201d is a misnomer for reasons the Culiac\u00e1n battle lays bare. This is not a mafia-type problem, nor one comprehensible within the framework of law enforcement and crime. This is something very much like an insurgency now\u2014think of the eruption of armed resistance in Culiac\u00e1n in 2019 as something like that in Sadr City in 2004\u2014and also something completely like state collapse. The cartels may be the proximate drivers but they are symptoms. Underlying them is a miasma of official corruption, popular alienation, and localist resentments\u2014and underlying all that is a low-trust civil society stripped of the mediating mechanisms that make peaceable democracy both feasible and attractive.\n\nNote as an aside that the cartels are not even necessarily drug-trafficking-specific entities. There have been ferocious and bloody cartel battles\u2014against one another, against the state\u2014for control of economic interests ranging from port operations to the avocado crop to lime exports. Illegal drugs supercharge their resources and ambitions, but absent them and that illegality they would simply assume another form.\n\nI want to pause here and be explicit: none of this is an argument that Mexicans are incapable of liberality and democracy. The millions of Mexicans in the United States illustrate the contrary quite well, and localist democratic structures in Mexico proper are often of the sort that would make a communitarian conservative\u2019s heart swell with pride. What is argued here is that Culiac\u00e1n illuminates that the Mexican state as constituted is incompetent to that end.\n\nSimply put, we can understand the past two centuries of Mexican history as a cyclic alternation between chaotic liberality and pluralism on the one hand, and orderly (if corrupt) autocracy on the other. The orderly and corrupt Porfiriato was followed by the horrors of civil war unleashed by Madero, followed in turn by the \u201cperfect dictatorship\u201d of the PRI, followed in turn by this century\u2019s emergence of true Mexican multiparty democracy\u2014and therefore the disintegration of the state we see now.\n\nThis is important because Americans have not had to think seriously about this for nearly a century: there is a place on the map marked Mexico, but much of it is governed by something other than the Mexican state. That\u2019s been true for years.\n\nThe Battle of Culiac\u00e1n, government surrender and all, made it open and explicit.\n\nWhat happens now, barring an exceedingly unlikely discovery of spine and competence by the government in Mexico City, is more and worse. The country is on a trajectory toward warlordism reminiscent of, say, 1930s China or its own 1910s. Some of those warlords will be the cartels. Some of them will be virtuous local forces genuinely on the side of order and justice\u2014for example the autodefensa citizen militias of Michoac\u00e1n. Some of them will be the official state, grasping for what it can. Some of them, given sufficient time, will be autonomous or even secessionist movements: look to Chiapas, Morelia, et al., for that.\n\nThe lines between all these groups will be hazy and easily crossed. None will be mutually exclusive from the others.\n\nIt is tragic and a pity, because Mexico has in fact mastered the forms if not the substance of democratic civics. It is a shame because much of the Mexican diaspora in the United States is transmitting back home ideas of natural rights and a virtuous armed citizenry\u2014right at the moment we ourselves have stopped believing in those things. (This has been a significant driver of the autodefensa phenomenon.) It is a loss because, depending on how you measure it, M\u00e9xico just this decade tipped into a majority middle-class society for the first time in its history. In regions like the Baj\u00edo, advanced manufacturing is taking root and a class of engineers is slowly changing the old ways.\n\nNevertheless as any student of history will tell you, revolution happens not when things are bad, but when expectations are frustrated.\n\nSo what does all this mean for the United States? A century of relative peace along our southern border has left us complacent. We haven\u2019t seriously thought about what it might mean if a nation of one hundred twenty million people with thousands of miles of land and coastal access to the United States went into collapse. We still tell ourselves a series of falsehoods about Mexico: that the immigration problem is about immigration, that the crime problem is about crime, that the Mexican state is the solution and not the problem, that they can handle their own affairs, that light-armor forces can overrun Culiac\u00e1n and it isn\u2019t our problem.\n\nFrom Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa, to Nogales, Arizona, is one day\u2019s drive.\n\nWe know how we handled it last time M\u00e9xico evaporated as a cohesive state, in 1910-1920. By late spring 1916, cross-border raiding got so bad that we mobilized the entire National Guard and called for volunteers. Most people remember the punitive expedition against the Villistas. Less remembered are the raids and counter-raids at places like San Ygnacio, Texas\u2014and still less remembered is the time the United States Army was compelled to attack and occupy Mexican Nogales in 1918, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 1919.\n\nYou may rightly ask whether we are capable of the same policy now\u2014and if we are, whether we are competent to execute it.\n\nMexico is not an enemy state, and the Mexicans are not an enemy people. Yet as Mexico falls apart, we need to ask ourselves questions normally reserved for objectively hostile nations. There is a war underway. It won\u2019t stop at the border.\n\nIt\u2019s time to look south, and think.\n\n\u2014 El Anti-Pozolero is a pseudonym.\n\n(We will return tomorrow to our regularly scheduled programming.)", "description": "My correspondent, in the essay below the jump, prefers to be anonymous.
