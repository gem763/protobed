Ronan Farrow had accumulated an enormous amount of capital reporting thoroughly researched and well-corroborated claims of sexual abuse that helped launch the #MeToo movement. He squandered that reputation for scrupulosity by reporting Deborah Ramirez\u2019s claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself in spite of the total absence of corroborating evidence and in spite of evidence that Ramirez herself was unsure of her memories.\n\nBut for sheer malice nothing can match the speed and ferocity with which reporters accepted the facially ludicrous rape story pushed by Michael Avenatti client Julie Swetnick. She claimed that she saw Kavanaugh \u201cwaiting his turn\u201d for a gang rape and spiking punch to facilitate gang rapes. The story was never remotely plausible, but that didn\u2019t stop media figures from shaming anyone who expressed public doubts on Twitter.\n\nPerhaps the nadir of the whole affair is when Vox helped \u201cexplain the news\u201d by publishing a piece arguing that the John Hughes movie Sixteen Candles provided \u201cimportant context\u201d for the Kavanaugh allegations. In the 1980s, you see, there was a different \u201ccultural understanding\u201d about gang rape.", "description": "", "authors": ["National Review", "Nationalreview.Com Ongoing-Smear-Campaign-Against-Brett-Kavanaugh"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
