REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - Part of a glacier on Mont Blanc, Europe\u2019s highest mountain, is at risk of collapse, prompting Italian authorities to close roads and evacuate Alpine hamlets and the prime minister to call for action to tackle global warming.\n\nA section estimated to contain up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice could fall down the mountain, the mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur, Stefano Miserocchi, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nMiserocchi ordered the closing of two roads and the evacuation of huts on the mountain, which is 4,800 metres (5,250 yards) high, after experts said the Planpincieux glacier was sliding at an increased speed, threatening part of the Ferret Valley.\n\nBetween the end of August and the beginning of September the lower part of the glacier was sliding at a speed of 50-60 cm (20-24 inches) per day. )\n\n\u201cThese phenomena show once more how the mountain is experiencing a period of great changes due to climate factors, so it is especially vulnerable\u201d, Miserocchi said.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking on Wednesday at the U.N.
