His hair was died red and he was obviously having a mental breakdown. But it wasn't related to [the movie] outside of the fact that it happened at a movie theatre.\u201d\n\nPhillips then went on to question why movies like the John Wick series get a pass, while Joker is now the centre of a row over gun violence in movies.\n\n\u201cThe one that bugs me more is the toxic white male thing when you go, \u2018Oh, I just saw John Wick 3.\u2019 He\u2019s a white male who kills 300 people and everybody\u2019s laughing and hooting and hollering,\u201d he added.\n\nView photos Director Todd Phillips, left and actor Joaquin Phoenix pose for photographers upon arrival at the screening for the film Joker, at a central London cinema, Wednesday, Sept 25, 2019.

It honestly doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\nIt also recently emerged that the now-remodelled cinema in which the Aurora shooting happened will not be showing the movie, which stars Joaquin Phoenix in a gritty origin story of Batman's arch nemesis.\n\nWriter-director Todd Phillips says it isn't fair to link his #JokerMovie to real-world violence: \"It's a fictional character in a fictional world that's been around for 80 years.\" pic.twitter.com/NcT4d9fjOQ \u2014 AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) September 24, 2019\n\nWarner Bros released a statement following the letter from the families of the Aurora shooting victims.\n\n\u201cGun violence in our society is a critical issue, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all victims and families impacted by these tragedies,\u201d the studio said in a statement.\n\nRead more: Aurora cinema will not show Joker\n\n\u201cOur company has a long history of donating to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Warner Bros believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nThe movie, which has been critically acclaimed and won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, lands in the UK on October 4.", "description": "Joker director Todd Phillips has questioned why the violent John Wick movies are 'held to a different standard' than his own.", "authors": ["Ben Arnold"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cMgKU2HZszEr8Lknx5wBMA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/ea60eb20-e04b-11e9-bfa5-48270cc17d1c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
