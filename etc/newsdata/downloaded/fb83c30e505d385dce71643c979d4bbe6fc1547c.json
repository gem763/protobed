On Saturday evening, President Trump tweeted, citing the response from the media as the reason for the change. His Twitter thread reads in part:\n\n\"We will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\"\n\nRead the full series of Tweets here and here.\n\nOriginal 10/18/2019: The White House announced yesterday that next year's Group of Seven summit, an annual gathering of world leaders, will take place at Trump National Doral Miami golf resort in Florida. \"That decision is without precedent in modern American history: The president used his public office to direct a huge contract to himself,\" said the Washington Post.\n\nThe startling news wasn't wholly surprising. During this year's G7 summit in Biarritz, France, in August, President Donald Trump mused about hosting next year's gathering. He bragged that Trump National Doral would be the perfect location, just eight miles from Miami International Airport and with \"ample parking\" to welcome the leaders of six countries and the many handlers who would accompany them.\n\nPhoto credit: NurPhoto More\n\nWhat can the leaders of the world's most advanced economies expect?\n\nThe Property Has Not Been Profitable in Recent Years\n\nAccording to the Trump Organization\u2019s own records, the property has suffered in the last few years. According to the Washington Post, tax consultant Jessica Vachiratevanurak, who was arguing that the property\u2019s tax bill should be lowered, reported to a county official last year that the net operating income of Trump National Doral had fallen by 69% from 2015 to 2017. She also stated the hotel was \"severely underperforming\" other resorts in the area, which includes an Intercontinental, a Best Western, a DoubleTree, and a Hyatt Place. She attributed the decline to Trump\u2019s damaged brand.\n\nThe summit will draw hundreds of diplomats, journalists, and security teams to Trump Doral next June, what is reportedly one of its slowest months of the year.\n\nYesterday, the White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney explained the White Houses's choice of the Trump property: \u201cDoral was far and away the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d he said. The administration apparently looked into 10 sites before choosing this one. Mulvaney quoted an anonymous site selection official who he said told him, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.\u201d\n\nYes, the airport is super close, but what else is nearby?\n\nThe Medley landfill (5 miles out) and Covanta Waste Energy facility (3 miles away), which have both received thousands of complaints for filling the air in Doral with terrible odors and making nearby living conditions unbearable. There is a class action lawsuit against Medley (which locals call Mount Trashmore) in the works. G7 2020 attendees will likely be protected from such smells from within the air-conditioned confines of Trump National.\n\nPhoto credit: The Washington Post More", "description": "The President tweeted this evening, citing media criticism as the reason for the change.", "authors": ["Leena Kim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QCfN85W_fbFQm4ibF3Id1A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/c239e0faf8fb2e057565facb740ab833", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
