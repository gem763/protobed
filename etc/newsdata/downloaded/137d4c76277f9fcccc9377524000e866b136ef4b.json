But Can He Settle Into Stardom?", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cAs my circumstances have changed, I\u2019ve had to move in a different way and make some adjustments,\u201d said DaBaby, who along with his team declined to address specific occurrences, but has insisted that he has only ever been protecting himself. His manager, Arnold Taylor, added, \u201cHe\u2019s street, but we ain\u2019t thugs \u2014 that\u2019s the difference,\u201d and echoed the need for more discretion and security as DaBaby\u2019s notoriety has increased.\n\n\u201cWe just need to move different and evolve,\u201d Taylor repeated as a general refrain.\n\nAcross two days in Los Angeles the week of his album release, DaBaby, who is compact like a cannonball, with an alpha manner and deep dimples, only ever seemed professional and locked-in, fully aware that stardom was his for the securing.\n\nRepeatedly, he flexed his prodigious work ethic and people-pleasing skills, crisscrossing the city for a nonstop slate of performances, interviews, handshakes and other obligations that come with the social-media-soaked music industry of today. With a crew of about a dozen at all times \u2014 including a relatively new security guard who resembles an oak tree built out of multiple smaller oak trees \u2014 the rapper was punctual and accommodating, hitting all of his marks while sneaking FaceTime kisses to his 2-year-old daughter.\n\nIn less than 24 hours, DaBaby managed to accomplish a blur of tasks including: a college show for some 10,000 undergrads interested in moshing; a 6 a.m. wake-up to announce \u201cKirk\u201d via social channels; a dance session in an Airbnb to tease a new song on the video platform Triller; back-to-back radio station interviews; a promo shoot for a streaming service (\u201cAlexa, play DaBaby\u201d); a multiple-hour taping for a web series; another one-on-one interview; two more radio station sit-downs; and a club appearance, all of which, of course, was documented for Instagram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a machine for a while now,\u201d said DaBaby, nearly hoarse from the marathon of self-promotion, though it was not even half-done and would continue into the next week and beyond. But more work, after all, was what he had been working toward.", "description": "The year\u2019s inescapable, breakout rapper has just released \u201cKirk,\u201d his third project in 12 months.
