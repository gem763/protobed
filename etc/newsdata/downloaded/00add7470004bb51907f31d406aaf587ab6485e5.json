He could spend decades in prison if convicted.\n\nAssange came to prominence when WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of secret US diplomatic cables in 2010, angering Washington which said he had put lives at risk.\n\nIn 2012, he took refuge in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes which he denied, saying he believed he would ultimately be sent on to the United States.\n\nHe was dragged from the embassy in April after seven years and given a 50-week jail term for skipping bail. That sentence was completed last month but he remains in prison while his extradition case continues.\n\nIn May, WikiLeaks said it had grave concerns about Assange\u2019s health and that he had been moved to a health ward at London\u2019s Belmarsh high-security prison.\n\nA previous hearing was cancelled because Assange was too ill to attend, his lawyer said.\n\nWhile the focus of today's hearing was general case management, the full extradition hearing is due to start on February 25 next year.", "description": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a London court on Monday for a hearing on whether he should be extradited to the United States to face spying charges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/80/12/1000x563_cmsv2_99a43ce1-152e-52b9-b9bc-9af6295190b3-4248012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
