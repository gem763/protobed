Rapists and killers would instead serve at least two thirds of their time.\n\nProposed legislation would see those who sneak back into the UK have their terms lengthened from weeks to years. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: \u2018Deterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country will make our country safer'\n\nAnother law would see murderers who refuse to reveal where they buried their victims spending longer behind bars.\n\nThe proposed legislation will extend to paedophiles who stay silent about their victims. This follows anger over the release of depraved nursery worker Vanessa George after just a decade inside.\n\nThe proposed legislation will extend to paedophiles who stay silent about their victims. This follows anger over the release of depraved nursery worker Vanessa George (pictured) after just a decade inside\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech also covers post-Brexit immigration, plastic pollution and building safety. On crime and punishment it includes:\n\nNew laws to crack down on the \u2018epidemic\u2019 of domestic violence;\n\nTougher community sentences to restore public confidence in the justice system;\n\nFaster extradition for offenders wanted abroad, without the need for the authorities to apply for a warrant;\n\nGreater protection for police officers involved in car chases.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \u2018Deterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country and putting those that do behind bars for longer will make our country safer.\u2019\n\nAround 400 criminals are estimated to breach deportation orders each year. Those who are caught face a maximum of six months in jail but typically serve just ten weeks.\n\nMinisters have decided the tougher sentences should stretch to years, but have not yet agreed a tariff. They say the legislation will also disrupt the activities of networks that facilitate the illegal return of offenders.\n\nThe proposed bills at a glance Immigration and Social Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill \u2013 to end freedom of movement and introduce a points-based immigration system from 2021, encouraging migrants to live outside of London\n\nEnvironment Bill \u2013 to bring in legally-binding target to reduce plastic waste and to ensure cleaner air\n\nCrime bills \u2013 crackdown on foreign offenders breaching deportation orders, plans to give murderers and sex offenders longer sentences if they hold back information about their victims\n\nRailway reform \u2013 a white paper to set out proposals to overhaul the current franchising system and create a new commercial model\n\nBuilding safety standards \u2013 the establishment of a new regulator with powers to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of building regulations\n\nNHS Health Investigations Bill \u2013 to create a new independent body with legal powers to ensure patient safety\n\nMental health reform \u2013 reduce detentions under the Mental Health Act by ensuring more people get the treatment they need\n\nElectoral Integrity Bill \u2013 to require voters to show photo ID before casting their ballot\n\nIn August the Daily Mail revealed that an Albanian double murderer was twice allowed to sneak into Britain and live here for 13 years.\n\nGentian Doda, a member of a notorious crime syndicate, was granted a British passport under a false name while on the run for the killings, which included gunning down an innocent young father with a Kalashnikov. A separate measure in the Queen\u2019s Speech aims to ensure paedophiles who fail to reveal the identity of their victims will stay in prison for longer.\n\nThe proposal to penalise criminals who stay silent comes under \u2018Helen\u2019s Law\u2019 after Helen McCourt, a 22-year-old insurance clerk murdered in 1988 by pub landlord Ian Simms.\n\nHe has always refused to reveal the location of her body.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland wants to extend this legislation to cover sexual abusers after public outrage over the case of George, 49.\n\nDespite refusing to say which toddlers she had molested in the nursery where she worked in Plymouth she was released after just ten years in jail.\n\nDomestic violence will also be tackled under the legislative proposals.\n\nMore than 732,000 such offences were recorded by police in the year to March \u2013 a 22 per cent annual increase.\n\nA Domestic Abuse Bill was brought to Parliament in July by Theresa May but it was automatically dropped when Parliament was suspended and ministers have now kept a promise to reintroduce it.\n\nDespite the pomp and pageantry around the Queen\u2019s Speech, it is likely to be voted down in the coming days as Boris Johnson is more than 40 votes short of a House of Commons majority.\n\nHowever, Labour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: \u2018It is hypocritical for the Tories to set out these plans when they were the ones who imposed cuts and let crime soar in the first place'\n\nInstead, the proposals will form the backbone of the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto for an election expected in weeks.\n\nLabour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: \u2018It is hypocritical for the Tories to set out these plans when they were the ones who imposed cuts and let crime soar in the first place. Everything was cut, from schools, to the NHS, to the police, to mental health services. They all had terrible consequences.\n\n\u2018This Queen\u2019s Speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\n\n\u2018We always argued that cuts have consequences.\u2019", "description": "Prison terms for those who sneak back into the UK would be lengthened from weeks to years.
