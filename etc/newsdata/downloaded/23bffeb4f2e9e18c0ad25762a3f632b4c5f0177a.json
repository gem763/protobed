The man who posted the photos on Facebook is thought to have fled to the mainland on Saturday and his Facebook page appeared as \u201cnot available\u201d as of today.\n\nThe pictures, which show a small, white dog submerged in water and being spun around helplessly in the washing machine, have sparked outrage, with at least 21,000 people signing an online petition calling for him to be punished.\n\nThe man, who goes by the name of Jacky Lo, posted a status update on Saturday in which he bragged that he was on his way out of Hong Kong as pressure mounted for him to be punished.\n\nThe post included a link to the petition, with Lo commenting: \u201cWanted?? This afternoon I'm going back to China. See ya later.\u201d\n\nThe photographs of the dog in the washing machine were originally posted in August.\n\nIn his post, Lo comments in Chinese: \u201cA super quick way to wash a dog: soak, clean, and dry. All done. Clean and quick!\u201d\n\nIn response to a comment underneath asking if the dog was dead, Lo answers: \u201cYes! Do you want to see it!\u201d\n\nAlthough it has not been confirmed whether the Facebook identity is genuine, the photographs appear to be real.\n\nHong Kong police said they were investigating the case as one of suspected animal cruelty and no arrests had been made so far.\n\nSome of the posts claim Lo is from the mainland and draw attention to photographs on his Facebook page that show him playing golf, partying at luxury hotels, gambling in Macau and posing next to expensive cars.\n\nThe page also features various photos of Tuen Mun.\n\nThe Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said what was being done to the dog was \u201ctruly horrific\u201d and urged the public to be vigilant and report suspected cases of animal abuse.\n\n\u201cWe do not recommend sharing and circulating these photos or videos on websites to avoid inviting more copycat [cases],\u201d the society said.\n\nAnimal cruelty carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of HK$200,000.", "description": "Photos of a dog churning in a washing machine have gone viral since gaining public attention last Thursday.
