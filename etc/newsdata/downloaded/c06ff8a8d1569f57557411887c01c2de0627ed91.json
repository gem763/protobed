For her, clothes are about identity, history and craft and definitely not about the \u201cthigh gap\u201d. She values intrigue over prettiness. Her cultural choices \u2013 what she reads and the exhibitions she goes to \u2013 are at least as important to her self-image as anything she wears.\n\nShe probably watches Killing Eve, this woman, so it makes perfect sense that Jodie Comer \u2013 AKA Villanelle \u2013 stars in the advertising campaign for Loewe, the craft-luxe brand that presented its spring/summer 2020 collection in Paris on Friday morning.\n\nThe set \u2013 a series of white-curtained antechambers created within the brutalist concrete curves of the Unesco heritage building \u2013 set the tone. Seven-feet-high shimmering amethyst geodes stood sentry, while fluffy clusters of pampas grass \u2013 a plant with undeniable connotations \u2013 were dotted around. Just before the first model stepped out they started to twirl slowly, to eccentric effect.\n\nThe show presented a continuation of the Loewe template: fine fabrics, artisanal details and a flattering fit-and-flare silhouette.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fit-and-flare skirt with a fluffy knit.

A series of white dresses in delicate fabrics \u2013 Japanese satin, geometric, guipure, chantilly and marguerite lace \u2013 felt at times like christening, communion or bridal gowns.\n\nIt was definitely sexy, with bra tops and a lot of transparency \u2013 perhaps that was what the pampas grass was about. At times it felt pagan, with a touch of the bucolic horror film Midsommer to the aesthetic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The mac is back as Loewe plays with proportions.

The bags, which are Loewe\u2019s bread and butter, included a soft bucket-shaped balloon bag, particularly covetable in crochet raffia.\n\nThe Comer advertising campaign \u2013 which went viral days before the show \u2013 features the Killing Eve actor staring into a mirror and saying \u201cLoewe\u201d repeatedly while acting out a series of emotions: sorrow, indignation, gratitude. Loewe is not a brand that everyone knows, and the fact that to the uninitiated its name is probably unpronounceable is surely part of the joke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sleek hair contrasts with a floaty sheer blouse.

Judging by the reaction to the show, it may well dominate the next decade too.", "description": "Fine fabrics, artisanal touches and a fit-and-flare silhouette dominate the collection at Paris fashion week", "authors": ["Hannah Marriott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9aa5558bc17b860cdc651c5448a086d3e6a148/0_27_4154_2492/master/4154.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92cbba3508f1dd1d1fad392f6626a182", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
