Let's see whether the technical analysts and the quants are in agreement.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of BMY below, prices appear to have been hammering out a base pattern. They made a new low in July but the indicators did not confirm it.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line did not make a new low in July, nor did the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator.\n\nIn the past few weeks BMY has closed above the 50-day moving-average line, and the slope of the line has turned up. BMY is also above the bottoming 200-day line.\n\nThe OBV line has been rising from mid-July, telling us that buyers of BMY have been more aggressive. The MACD oscillator is above the zero line and bullish.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of BMY below, the major trend is still down but some bullish clues are there. Prices are above the bottoming 40-week moving-average line. The weekly OBV line is moving up and the MACD oscillator is close to crossing the zero line from below.\n\nIn this close only weekly Point and Figure chart of BMY below, we can see a possible upside price target of $62.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders and investors could go long BMY at current levels, risking a close below $47. The low $60s is our price target.", "description": "TK...BMY", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Bristol-Myers Squibb Is Set To Emerge A Basing Pattern", "Thestreet'S Quants Like The Stock.
