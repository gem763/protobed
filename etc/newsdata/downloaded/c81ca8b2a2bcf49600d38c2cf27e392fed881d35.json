[Photo/Agencies]\n\nBotswana's incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi's reelection has ensured stability in the diamond-rich country as the country tries to bridge income inequality, analysts say.\n\nFinal counting shows that Masisi's Botswana Democratic Party secured 29 of 57 parliamentary seats, representing 51 percent of the vote. Voting began on Oct 23.\n\nMasisi vowed on Saturday to make the economy his top priority. \"The overriding intention is to re-steer this economy in another direction,\" he said.\n\nDavid Kikaya, an African studies researcher, said the election results indicate a departure from the past, noting that the country has had some sort of dynasty of a one - party show.\n\n\"With the onslaught of the Umbrella for Democratic Change party coming on board as well as Botswana Patriotic Front, it means the win has not been as automatic as the previous ones. Only 51 percent of the vote also means a weakening dynasty of the past,\" he said.\n\nGerrishon Ikiara, an economics lecturer at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, said the reelection of Masisi means extension of the continuity and stability of the country.\n\n\"Since gaining independence, Botswana has had a unique leadership in Africa in terms of objectivity and integrity. The retaining of power by the ruling party indicates that stability is guaranteed in the next five years,\" Ikiara said.\n\nBotswana has been one of the world's fastest-growing economies since independence in 1966. Botswana is one of the world's biggest diamond producers, but it was hit hard by a drop in diamond prices in 2009 and a record drought in 2015.\n\nIkiara said Masisi's previous performance has been good, especially in fighting corruption, a move that was well received by the people.\n\n\"Unlike many other Africans, Botswana people seem to respect stability a lot, hence they see Masisi as somebody who can continue with the tradition. The economy has also been doing well, growing at 8 percent for most of the past six decades, which is a testimony of good party leadership,\" he said.", "description": "Botswana's incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi's reelection has ensured stability in the diamond-rich country as the country tries to bridge income inequality, analysts say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db64db7a310cf3e97a32ecc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
