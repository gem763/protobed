Sindh Police and others on non-compliance of the court ruling about ban on Gutka.\n\nThe court expressed its surprise over the alarming rate of mouth cancer patients in Karachi.\n\nDr Ghulam Hyder, in-charge doctor at Cancer Ward at Jinnah Hospital, told the court that the outpatient department (OPD) daily attends more than 300 patients and 70 percent of them suffering from mouth cancer. Majority of these patients found to be students or young factory workers, doctor said.\n\nThe ratio of these patients in Karachi is far above than other parts of the country, the doctor further said.\n\n\u201cIt is an alarming situation, extend the court your friendly support,\u201d the bench asked the doctor in an interchange. \u201d Attend the court proceedings tomorrow for recommendations about the legislation,\u201d the bench told the doctor.\n\nJustice Salahuddin Panhwar in an earlier proceeding said, \u201cPeople are dying by chewing Gutka but no one sensing (seriousness of) the matter.\u201d\n\nThe government didn\u2019t legislate despite the court orders, Justice Panhwar remarked.\n\n\u201cFactories of Gutka, Mava and Mainpuri should be sealed forthwith,\u201d court said. \u201d A legislation bill should be tabled in the assembly immediately,\u201d the bench directed.\n\n\u201cPolicemen are involved in sale of dangerous substances like Gutka and minting millions of money from it,\u201d the bench remarked.\n\nA policeman when caught (in the business) reinstated to service after a suspension of few days, the Justice said.\n\nThe court will act against the SSP if any thing happens to the petitioner, the court warned the police.\n\nAdvocate Muzammil Mumtaz and others had filed petition in court and sought action against manufacturing and sale of the harmful substances alleging that the police were doing nothing against them.\n\nThe court in another case in December last year had directed Sindh advocate general, law secretary and others to file comments with regard to promulgation of the law which banned the sale and manufacturing of Gutka and Mainpuri in the province.\n\nThe court had observed that the manufacture and sale of Gutka and Mainpuri was indeed a serious issue and since no proper legislation made in this regard, the perpetrators were feeling free to continue playing with the lives of people, especially young people, as they thought that even if they were caught, they would be freed either after paying a small amount as fine or facing confinement of few days.\n\nGutka is a preparation of chewing tobacco made of crushed areca nut, tobacco, catechu, paraffin wax, slaked lime and sweet or savory flavourings.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Sindh High Court expressed surprise over alarming rate of mouth cancer patients in Karachi while hearing a petition seeking ban on Gutka and other harmful substances.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sindh-High-Court.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
