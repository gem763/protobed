While it doesn\u2019t look quite as modern as the iPad Pro, it still has a big 10.5-inch screen and comes in a range of colors, including Space Gray, Silver, and Gold.\n\nPerhaps even more important than how the iPad Air looks is how it performs. The Air is powered by an A12 Bionic processor, which is more powerful than the processor you\u2019ll find inside the entry-level iPad, so you can easily use the tablet for playing games and even some basic graphic design. The iPad Air comes with either 64GB or 256GB of storage, which should be plenty for most, and is rated for a battery life of up to 10 hours.\n\nThe iPad Air offers other smart features too. For example, it\u2019s fully compatible with the Apple Pencil, and Apple also sells a keyboard cover for it, so you could almost use it as a laptop replacement if you so choose. And, thanks to the new iPadOS operating system, which offers a ton of great productivity features, using the iPad Air as a laptop is easier than ever.", "description": "Business Insider - The iPad Air is one of the most popular tablets you can buy, but it can be too expensive for many.
