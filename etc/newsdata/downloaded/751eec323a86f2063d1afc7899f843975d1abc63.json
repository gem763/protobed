After comfortably leading the Nationals 3-0 through five innings and 3-1 through seven, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen \u2014 specifically Clayton Kershaw and Joe Kelly \u2014 forked over the lead. The Nationals were off to the races, ultimately winning 7-3 in 10 innings.\n\nHere\u2019s what transpired:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nManager Dave Roberts brought Kershaw in for the final out of the seventh inning in relief of starter Walker Buehler, who exited with runners on first and second and two outs\n\nKershaw remained in the game in the eighth, immediately serving up back-to-back solo home runs to Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto, tying the game at 3-3\n\nKelly entered the game in the ninth inning, working a 1-2-3 inning\n\nKelly remained in the game in the 10th inning, loading the bases with no outs on a walk, a ground-rule double, and an intentional walk before surrendering a go-ahead grand slam to Howie Kendrick\n\nDodgers fans and people who have watched the Dodgers in recent years saw that happening from a mile away. Consider Dodgers fan and Baseball Prospectus editor-in-chief Craig Goldstein, who tweeted on Monday, \u201cAlready getting annoyed at how the Dodgers are going to use Kershaw in Game 5 [\u2026] when they don\u2019t need to anyway because their bullpen is good enough to not have to turn to a starter when Buehler is throwing.\u201d\n\nBullpen management is not Roberts\u2019 strong suit, especially in the playoffs. Here\u2019s an article Craig wrote last postseason about Roberts\u2019 bullpen management. How about one from 2017? And here\u2019s one from me in 2016, just for good measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoberts compounded his error by gambling on Kelly after he pitched a 1-2-3 inning in the top of the ninth. Kelly went multiple innings in eight of his 55 appearances during the regular season. He allowed nine runs in total across those 12 1/3 innings. Kelly was also coming off of a disastrous Game 3 appearance in which he loaded the bases on two walks and a single, uncorked a wild pitch, and walked another batter before leaving without recording an out. Kelly\u2019s 10th inning in Game 5 went: walk, ground-rule double, intentional walk, grand slam. His 1-2-3 ninth inning was less predictable than that.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 bullpen as a unit isn\u2019t bad. Its aggregate 3.85 ERA ranked fifth in baseball. Its 4.06 FIP ranked sixth and 4.25 xFIP seventh. Closer Kenley Jansen appeared in the NLDS just once, with a six-run lead in the ninth inning of Game 3. Pedro B\u00e1ez recorded two outs in the series, one apiece in Game 2 and 4. Adam Kolarek held Soto 0-for-3 with two strikeouts in three at-bats previously in the series. None of them were used in Game 5 in meaningful situations. The Dodgers paid dearly for Roberts\u2019 lack of confidence in the rest of his bullpen.\n\nKershaw and Kelly are going to take some heat for their failures in Game 5. It\u2019s not squarely on their shoulders. Roberts didn\u2019t put them in a position to succeed. He mismanaged his bullpen again and now a team that won 106 games during the regular season will not advance into the NLCS. One wonders if this loss might be so bad that it costs Roberts his job in L.A.", "description": "Manager Dave Roberts, more than Clayton Kershaw and Joe Kelly, cost the Dodgers Game 5 of the NLDS against the Nationals.", "authors": ["Bill Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iiVApKja1O4OvwG6sujdXw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QPCBDwPsa_cfREcCOUWK5Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/3eea52d226b33788bd09b67f827afba6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
