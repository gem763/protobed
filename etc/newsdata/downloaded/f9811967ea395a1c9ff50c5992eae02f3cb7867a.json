Elizabeth Warren's 2020 wealth tax plan, said America has entered a new Gilded Age.\n\nThe big picture: Warren's \"ultra-millionaire tax\" is one of the most progressive tax plans on the Democratic market. It aims to adjust rates so that the rich are not paying less, proportionately, in taxes than the wealthy. Opponents of the plan argue it would de-incentivize investments and stifle economic growth.", "description": "Warren's plan is among the most progressive of 2020 candidates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
