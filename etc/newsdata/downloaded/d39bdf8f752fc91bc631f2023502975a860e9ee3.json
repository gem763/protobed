She describes an evening that marches one the timeline given by others,' said Farrow of the night in Sochi when Nevils was allegedly raped by Lauer.\n\n'There were eyewitnesses to what happened before and after that moment. She described this event consistently over the years.'\n\nHe then added: 'And look, it's telling that NBC News paid her a seven-figure settlement to ensure that she can't talk about what the network knew about it.'\n\nIt is also now being revealed that it was Nevils' boss and Lauer's former co-host, Meredith Vieira, who encouraged the young woman to come forward.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSpeaking out: Brooke Nevils (above circled with Meredith Vieira) received a 'seven-figure settlement to ensure that she can't talk about what the network knew about it' said Ronan Farrow on Monday\n\nComing forward: 'There were eyewitnesses to what happened before and after that moment. She described this event consistently over the year,' said Farrow of her account (Nevils above with Vieira on a trip to Cape Cod)\n\nEmbattled NBC News president has been dealing with he fallout in the wke of this revelations since last week.\n\nHe addressed staff after the news broke in a meeting last week, explaining: 'I am sure you guys and folks on your teams have questions, you will have questions in the days ahead, and I want to literally beg you to please ask them.'\n\nHe went on to say: 'Please tell the folks you work with to ask them. Whether it\u2019s this morning or by reaching out to me by phone or email, anytime day or night there is not a question that I\u2019m afraid to answer. I only ask to opportunity to do so.'\n\nLater in the meeting, Oppenheim also explained the reason he and other executives kept quiet as more and more women came forward to accuse Lauer.\n\nIt was Nevils decision to go public with her story in Farrow's upcoming book, and as Oppenheim told staffers on Monday, she decided when she would break her silence,\n\nOppenheim also explained that there was an obligation on their end as well to protect the victim, which is why they were so quiet\n\n'Our first obligation when someone brings forward a complaint is to protect that person\u2019s confidentiality. All of our communication to you guys and externally, frankly to anyone, the words were carefully chosen to characterize it exactly the same way that her attorney was characterizing it,' he explained to those in attendance and others who had dialed in tot eh meeting remotely.\n\n'That confidentially is not something that I am ever going to breach, not only for her sake.'\n\nHe then stated: 'The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now, I think that is appropriate.'\n\nSupport system: It was her former boss Meredith Vieira (above in Rhode Island with Nevils) who encouraged her to come forward and share her allegations with NBC executives\n\nEmployee relations: Noah Oppenheim (center) met with top members of the NBC News team on Thursday to discuss the events of the previous 24 hours (Lauer on left, Farrow on right)\n\nLauer has not been seen in public since the details of his alleged affair were revealed, but he did deny the claims made by Nevils in an open letter.\n\nThye disgraced anchor painted Nevils as a bitter lover who had consensual relations with him and grew upset after he stopped speaking to her at work.\n\n'I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual,' wrote Lauer\n\n'The story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object.'\n\nHe continued: 'She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.'\n\nLater in the letter, Lauer suggested that Nevils accused him because she was upset about their split.\n\n'I admit, I ended the affair poorly. I simply stopped communicating with her. Brooke continued to reach out,' wrote Lauer.\n\n'She admitted to NBC at the time she filed her complaint that she called me late at night while I was home with my family in an effort to rekindle the affair.'\n\nNevils responded to this letter in a comment to NBC news later in the day of Wednesday.\n\n'There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,' explained Nevils.\n\n'His open letter was a case study in victim blaming and concluded by threatening any other woman who might dare to speak out against him.'\n\nNevils chose to share her story with Farrow, who details her allegations in his new book Catch and Kill.", "description": "Ronan Farrow shared why Brooke Nevils' claims ultimately led to Matt Lauer's demise and how much money she walked away with in an interview with CBS This Morning on Monday.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19705190-0-image-a-30_1571077455922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
