The acquisition is expected to accelerate PTC\u2019s ability to attract new customers with a SaaS-based product offering and position the company to capitalize on the inevitable industry transition to SaaS. Pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed in November 2019.\n\nLocated in Cambridge, MA, Onshape was founded in 2012 by CAD pioneers and tech legends, including Jon Hirschtick, John McEleney, and Dave Corcoran, inventors and former executives of SolidWorks. Onshape has secured more than $150 million in funding from leading venture capital firms and has more than 5,000 subscribers around the world. The company\u2019s software offering is delivered in a SaaS model, making it accessible from any connected location or device, eliminating the need for costly hardware and administrative staff to maintain. Distributed and mobile teams of designers, engineers, and others can benefit from the product\u2019s cloud nature, enabling them to improve collaboration and to dramatically reduce the time needed to bring new products to market \u2013 while simultaneously staying current with the latest software.\n\n\u201cPTC has earned a reputation for successfully pursuing new innovations that drive corporate growth,\u201d said Jim Heppelmann, president and CEO, PTC. \u201cBuilding on the strong momentum we have with our on-premises CAD and PLM businesses, we look to our future and see a new growth play with SaaS.\u201d\n\nThis acquisition is the logical next step in PTC\u2019s overall evolution to a recurring revenue business model, the first step of which was the company\u2019s successful transition to subscription licensing, completed in January 2019. The SaaS model, while nascent in the CAD and PLM market, is rapidly becoming industry best practice across most other software domains.\n\n\u201cToday, we see small and medium-sized CAD customers in the high-growth part of the CAD market shifting their interest toward SaaS delivery models, and we expect interest from larger customers to grow over time,\u201d continued Heppelmann. \u201cThe acquisition of Onshape complements our on-premises business with the industry\u2019s only proven, scalable pure SaaS platform, which we expect will open new CAD and PLM growth opportunities while positioning PTC to be the leader as the market transitions toward the SaaS model.\u201d\n\nFor customers, the SaaS model enables faster work, improved collaboration and innovation, with lower up-front costs and with no IT infrastructure to administer and maintain. For software providers, the SaaS model has been proven to generate a more stable and predictable revenue stream, increase customer loyalty as customers benefit from earlier adoption of technology innovations, and enable expansions into new segments and geographies.\n\n\u201cAt Onshape, we share PTC\u2019s vision for helping organizations transform the way they develop products,\u201d said Jon Hirschtick, CEO and co-founder, Onshape. \u201cWe and PTC believe that the product development industry is nearing the \u2018tipping point\u2019 for SaaS adoption of CAD and data management tools. We look forward to empowering the customers we serve with the latest innovations to improve their competitive positions.\u201d\n\nOnshape will operate as a business unit within PTC, with current management reporting directly to PTC President and CEO Jim Heppelmann.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to bring such an incredibly talented team of technical and business leaders into the company and look forward to taking our business to the next level of growth,\u201d concluded Jim Heppelmann.\n\nBarclays acted as exclusive financial advisor to PTC on the transaction.\n\nFor additional financial information pertaining to the Onshape acquisition, and for details on how to join the conference call PTC management will host to discuss its earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and this acquisition, please review PTC\u2019s Q4 2019 press release.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains statements about future events and expectations, including timing of closing of the acquisition, the effect of the acquisition on our future growth and financial results and the expected value of the acquired technology to our business.
