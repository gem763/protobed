But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cApple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision,\u201d the article said.\n\nAs with other campaigns led by state-run press against foreign firms for perceived support of the democracy movement in Hong Kong, comments on China\u2019s strictly controlled internet echoed those of the media.\n\n\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t an accident that Apple allowed HKmap.live online,\u201d wrote one commentator on Weibo.\n\n\u201c(Apple) should know exactly what it\u2019s doing\u2026 It seems that there is too little domestic pressure against Apple.\u201d\n\nApple, which has a huge presence in China, did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\nHong Kong has endured nearly four months of protests that were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to the mainland.\n\nThey snowballed into a movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability, in the biggest challenge to China\u2019s rule of Hong Kong since its handover from the British in 1997.\n\nChina tolerates no dissent on the highly sensitive issue and has in recent weeks increasingly targeted foreign companies and organisations for perceived support of the protesters.\n\nThe American National Basketball Association was this week targeted after the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, posted a tweet supporting the protesters.\n\nUS jewellery brand Tiffany and Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, have also been heavily criticised in China.\n\nHong Kong Free Press relies on direct reader support.
