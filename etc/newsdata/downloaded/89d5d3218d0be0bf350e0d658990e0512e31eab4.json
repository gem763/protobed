USA TODAY Handout\n\nThe only thing weirder than Robert Pattinson's new film might be the outrageous headlines it's inspired.\n\n\"Robert Pattinson actually wet himself making 'The Lighthouse,' \" Yahoo recently declared of the nautical psychodrama (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expanding wider throughout October and November). \"Robert Pattinson did some truly foul stuff to get into character for his new movie,\" Refinery29 gawked, while Vanity Fair noted that he went to \"great, vomitous lengths\" to play a stoic lighthouse keeper who goes insane.\n\nSimilarly unusual reports of him eating mud, getting blackout drunk and nearly punching writer/director Robert Eggers on the set quickly made the rounds on social media. But the \"Twilight\" actor insists most of that behavior was wildly exaggerated or taken out of context from his conversations with Esquire and Interview Magazine.\n\nRobert Pattinson no longer hates 'Twilight': The actor says he has 'very warm memories' of it\n\n\"I didn't actually get drunk \u2013 that would've been absolutely impossible,\" Pattinson says with a laugh. \"I can easily whip myself up to be way more out of control sober, because if I was drunk, I'd just be chuckling to myself.\"\n\n\"Peeing myself was another exaggeration,\" he adds, \"but I did eat quite a lot of mud,\" rolling around and licking up puddles as he tapped into his unhinged character.\n\nEphraim (Robert Pattinson) descends into madness in Robert Eggers' \"The Witch\" follow-up \"The Lighthouse.\" (Photo: A24)\n\nFollowing audacious, critically hailed turns as a shifty bank robber (2017's \"Good Time\") and captive astronaut (last spring's \"High Life\"), Pattinson, 33, wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty in \"Lighthouse,\" an R-rated black-and-white film co-starring Willem Dafoe as a rollicking ex-sailor named Thomas, who takes on Pattinson's Ephraim as his assistant.\n\nSet in the late 19th century, the dark comedy unfolds in a lighthouse with mystical powers on the rocky Atlantic coast. Living and working in close quarters, the incongruous duo starts to unravel after Ephraim, in a momentary fit of rage, unknowingly angers the sea gods and a violent storm traps them inside for days. Feeling increasingly claustrophobic and irked with one another, the men pass the time drinking, dancing and literally wrestling for power over their remote post. (And that's when Ephraim isn't masturbating to a mermaid figurine, which plays a nightmarish role in his descent into madness.)\n\n\"It's such a crazy script,\" Pattinson says of \"Lighthouse,\" Eggers' second feature film after 2015 horror breakout \"The Witch.\" Shooting on a rural inlet in Nova Scotia last year, \"we were essentially in exactly the same conditions as those characters would be in reality, and there's something kind of freeing when you're just constantly covered in mud and soaking wet. There was a kind of anarchic energy, which I always thought was really fun but also pretty exhausting.\"\n\nWilliem Dafoe, left, and Robert Pattinson spent weeks inside a tiny lighthouse structure built for the film while shooting in Canada last year. (Photo: ERIC CHAKEEN/A24)\n\nDafoe, 64, remembers a particularly surreal day, when one of their characters leads the other around on a leash outside and orders him to bark like a dog.\n\n\"It was miserable,\" Dafoe says. \"My feet were all cut up, and it's hard and it's wet and it's full of briers. You don't sense quite how bad it is (watching it).\"\n\nSave for the occasional weekend lobster boil, Pattinson and Dafoe rarely socialized during shooting: Not because of any actual tension between the actors, but they were literally \"barefoot, covered in mud and blood, there's broken china on the floor, it smells like something died in there, and it's freezing,\" Eggers says. \"What's there to talk about?\"\n\nAs for that supposed dust-up with Pattinson, there wasn't one: \"He's a professional \u2013 he's not going to threaten to punch me or anything,\" the filmmaker says. There was one rainy day during the shoot where \"the rain wasn't (showing) in his close-up, so we were spraying him with a fire hose. At that moment, I could see he was like, '(Expletive) this, man.' \"\n\n\"Lighthouse\" director Robert Eggers, from left, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson at Cannes Film Festival in France, where the movie made its world premiere in May. (Photo: JOEL C RYAN/INVISION/AP)\n\nDespite the taxing physical demands and Ephraim's loose grip on sanity, Pattinson never feared for his own mental well-being while making \"Lighthouse.\"\n\n\"When someone's going through their most psychologically tormented moment and you combine it with (masturbating), there's something so hilarious and perverse that you don't see in movies,\" he says.\n\nZoe Kravitz as Catwoman: Jason Momoa 'stoked' for role; Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer react\n\nThe U.K. native, who next dons the cowl as Matt Reeves' \"The Batman\" (in theaters in 2021), even gets some of the film's most laugh-out-loud funny lines, earnestly screaming, \"I'm sick of your (expletive) farts!\" to Dafoe's chronically flatulent character in a heated confrontation.\n\nThe gassy gibe has already been a hit with critics on Twitter, which Pattinson wouldn't mind following him for the rest of his career.\n\n\"That'd be funny, wouldn't it? Walking down the street and people yell, 'Your farts! Your farts!' \" he jokes. \"If that is my legacy, that would be a great one, for sure.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/17/robert-pattinson-ate-lot-mud-playing-madman-lighthouse/3923860002/", "description": "\"Twilight\" actor Robert Pattinson is gloriously unhinged in his pitch-black comedy \"The Lighthouse,\" playing an ex-sailor who loses his mind.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "Published P.M.
