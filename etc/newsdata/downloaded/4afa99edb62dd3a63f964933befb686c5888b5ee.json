Sterling had a good run-up, but some investors are lightening their positions.\"\n\nThe pound fell 0.24% to $1.2757, pulling back from a five-month high of $1.2800 reached on Tuesday.\n\nAgainst the euro ( ), the British currency fell around 0.2% to 86.48 pence. On Tuesday, sterling hit 86.25 pence per euro, the strongest since May 10.\n\nThe pound on Tuesday jumped after Bloomberg News reported that negotiators hoped an agreement would be reached by midnight on Tuesday in Europe, but a lack of news in Asia about the talks helped push the currency lower, traders said.\n\nWithout a Brexit deal, trade from Britain that previously flowed unhindered across the EU's single market would be subject to customs tariffs and safety inspections, which many fear would cause economic turmoil.\n\nIn Asia, the fresh U.S.-China strains over Hong Kong pushed the safe-haven yen higher, helping it claw back earlier losses, as worries about relations between the economic superpowers and disappointment with efforts to end their trade war marred sentiment.\n\nIn the onshore market, the yuan fell around 0.22% to 7.0973 per dollar. In the offshore market, the yuan was off more than 0.2% to 7.1028 versus the dollar.\n\nA bruising trade war between the United States and China that has dragged on for more than a year has already placed incredible strains on relations between the two countries.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of often violent protests against China's rule of the former British colony.\n\nAny signs of support from U.S. lawmakers for the protest movement is likely to draw Beijing's ire and make a resolution to the trade war less likely.\n\nReports of a \"Phase 1\" trade deal between the United Statesand China last week initially cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed anyenthusiasm.\n\nThe yen rose slightly to 108.66 per dollar, pulling away from a two-month low. The yen also rose around 0.4% versus the pound ( ) and around 0.5% against the Australian dollar ( ).\n\nThe ( ) against a basket of six currencies rose slightly by 0.04% to 98.323.", "description": "Sterling rally pauses, yuan falls on U.S. friction over Hong Kong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F0BV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
