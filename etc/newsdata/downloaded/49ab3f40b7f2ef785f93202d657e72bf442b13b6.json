This week, they threatened to suspend programmes that chocolate makers rely on to certify that their beans are not grown in protected forests or with the forced labor of children.\n\n\n\nChocolate makers cannot claim that they\u2019re sourcing cocoa sustainably and at the same time hold back their support for a plan that will considerably improve the livelihoods of small-scale producers, said Yves Kone, the managing director of Ivory Coast\u2019s industry regulator, Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao, known as the CCC. The sustainability programs only serve a small number of farmers, while the new price mechanism will benefit all growers, according to the CCC.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend that we are working with the farmers, investing in sustainability and refusing to pay the farmer,\u201d Kone told reporters Friday in the commercial hub of Abidjan. \u201cSustainability is also paying farmers and working together.\u201d\n\nIncome guarantee\n\nIvory Coast and Ghana\u2019s price plan is designed to raise the average price for their cocoa from next October to at least $2,600 per ton, of which farmers will be paid about 70% after deducting costs. New York cocoa futures for delivery in December have averaged $2,372 per ton so far this year.\n\nAnalysts are questioning whether the plan will work because companies aren\u2019t able to hedge the premium. The incentive of higher income will also entice farmers to grow more than what the market may need, often on land cleared in protected areas, and destabilize prices further.\n\nIvory Coast had 16 million hectares (40 million acres) of forests in 1960, but this has fallen to 3 million hectares in 2018. Ghana is losing its forests at a faster pace than any other country in the world, according to Global Forest Watch.\n\n\u201cThe problem here is they\u2019re going to encourage more production of the bad kind,\u201d said Edward George, an independent cocoa expert. \u201cThere\u2019s a real danger of overproduction and also unsustainable and damaging production.\u201d\n\nWithout the sustainability programs, chocolate brands cannot guarantee that the cocoa they buy is not impacting protected areas and grown without child labour, said Sergey Chetvertakov, an analyst at IHS Markit\u2019s Agribusiness Intelligence. \u201cSuch statements are demanded by consumers.\u201d", "description": "They either have support a contentious plan to raise the pay of impoverished farmers, or risk a halt to programmes that sustainability-conscious consumers increasingly demand.", "authors": ["Leanne De Bassompierre", "Manisha Jha"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2002/ee6ba7f4c3ce4e7ca04dfb2369341eba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
