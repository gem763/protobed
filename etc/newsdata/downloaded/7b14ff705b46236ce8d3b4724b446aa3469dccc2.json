When Ethan unfairly has a go at Rash later, Rash does something you\u2019d have to describe as\u2026 rash. Has he waved the CT1 position goodbye?\n\nElsewhere, Rosa (Jacey Salles) is too preoccupied to listen to Ollie (Harry Collett)\u2019s problems so he vents them elsewhere which results in a trip to the ED \u2013 again. David (Jason Durr) discovers the reason Rosa is so distracted \u2013 and it looks like a love letter! Here are all the spoilers to watch out for.\n\n1. The episode opens with Rash riding to work on his precious bike that he\u2019s just got back from Mason (Victor Oshin). How happy he looks as he zips along the highways and byways of Holby on his way to another day of saving lives. You just know that much happiness can\u2019t last\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. David is a little bit disturbed to see a piece of paper belonging to Rosa with her name and his \u2013 and love hearts. Is she secretly in love with him? The truth is much sadder as Rosa opens up about a tragedy in her life.\n\nBeing late for work isn\u2019t the worst of his problems (Picture: BBC)\n\n3. It\u2019s Duffy (Cathy Shipton)\u2019s first day working in the department as a volunteer, but Robyn (Amanda Henderson) is concerned that it might be too much for Duffy when she spots her looking tired. An anxious Charlie (Derek Thompson) talks to Robyn about his frustration that his wife isn\u2019t getting the help she needs.\n\n4. The main patient story starts with a man asleep in bed and another man standing at the foot of the bed wielding a sledgehammer. Anyone who\u2019s seen the film \u2018Misery\u2019 will be a bit tense about what might happen next.\n\n5. David\u2019s son Ollie is back at the ED yet again \u2013 but this time he\u2019s injured someone else. As an unhappy Ollie confides in Rosa, will David realise how important she is to his family?\n\nDuffy\u2019s back as a volunteer (Picture: BBC)\n\n6. Marty (Shaheen Jafargholi) helps a patient to decide what\u2019s important, while Mason uncovers a secret another patient has been hiding.\n\n7. Being in love with Effie is clearly not improving Ethan\u2019s mood, especially as he\u2019s still avoiding her calls after being warned off by her father last week. He\u2019s in a particularly bad mood with Rash, being critical of him but not helpful when Rash raises concerns with him. Eventually the tension between the two of them erupts \u2013 and Rash does something he might well regret.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Your preview for the latest Casualty episode.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rash-dylan-casualty-10-23e7_1571663624.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
