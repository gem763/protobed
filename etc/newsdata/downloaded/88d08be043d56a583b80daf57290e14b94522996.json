Consequently, the Benn Act that requires Johnson to seek an extension from the EU will be triggered. There are questions as to whether the bloc will grant a further delay, though they are barely plausible. Essentially then, the strongest likelihood is that hopes for the beginning of the end of Brexit uncertainty on Saturday have been dashed. Markets will react accordingly.\n\nHow markets will react to the latest Brexit delay\n\nThe strong advance of the \u2014up as much as 6.5% this month\u2014could be in as much jeopardy as it may have been if Johnson\u2019s deal had been voted down. Investors have made clear their distaste for an uncontrolled Brexit over the last 3 years, though in recent months, sharp discounts have also been applied whenever circumstances appear to lengthen uncertainty.\n\nObviously, the near-term political outlook remains as bewildering as ever. The Prime Minister now aims to \u201cintroduce the legislation needed to leave the European Union with or without a deal on 31st October\u201d. He remains adamant that he \u201cwon\u2019t negotiate delay\u201d. The Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg announced a debate for Monday on a section of the European Withdrawal Act 2018, raising the possibility of another vote. These intentions are not likely to equate to concrete moves till later in the week, if at all. As such, a volatile start of next week will probably be followed by relatively static trading as participants wait for what\u2019s really going to happen next.\n\nThe instinct to sell prolonged uncertainty is backed by an economy showing clear signs of corrosion. The implications for sterling are as negative as for stocks tied to Britain\u2019s economy for most revenues. Many more of these are concentrated on the index than on the . On Monday, a probable sharp stock market reversal that may reverberate globally, is set to be led by the mid-cap index.\n\nMind the Monday gap\n\nWe also expect immediate price gaps to become evident. These represent panicked trading whereby orders can be left unfulfilled as assets fail to trade incrementally in one direction or another but jump significant distances in one go. These can be dangerous for traders, as my colleague Joe Perry eloquently points out.\n\nGiven the strong probability of these, volumes can be expected to be even lower than they usually are at the start and perhaps well into the trading session on Monday, mostly in Asia. But short-term sterling options data at Friday\u2019s close showed implied volatility \u2013 which depicts how sharply the market may swing over the term of the trade \u2013 at the highest level since late February 2009. In other words, it may be difficult to escape major market dramas on \u2018Manic Monday\u2019.\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
