Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran. \u201cI think it\u2019s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,\u201d one of Bloomberg\u2019s allies familiar with the talks told CNBC. \u201cNothing can happen unless Biden drops out and that\u2019s not happening anytime soon,\u201d this person added. \u201cHe\u2019s like everyone else. They can\u2019t get it out of their system,\u201d said a banking executive who has known Bloomberg for decades. \u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d said another New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg endorsed Clinton in 2016 but has been considering a run since 2012, according to those close to him. As New York City mayor, his main contribution to New York was addition by subtraction, in that he tried to ban nearly everything. From large sodas to cigarettes to delicious fatty foods, Bloomberg thought you were simply too stupid to know what's good for you, hence his love affair for big government. Here's a list of 32 of his regulations.", "description": ".10/14/2019 19:20:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/286/b2634fc9-3306-49e9-a9d2-a6ee01d04458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
