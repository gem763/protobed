In theory, that would apply retroactively to him and others.\n\nThe eleven justices were expected to finish voting Thursday, but they announced that because only four justices had their decisions in, the ruling would come next month.\n\nMany analysts expect it will be released during the first week of the month.\n\nLula is among scores of high-profile political and business leaders caught up in the sprawling corruption probe known as \"Operation Car Wash.\"\n\nThe popular leftist leader has been incarcerated at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba since April 2018.\n\nLula was sentenced to almost 13 years in jail in February in a separate corruption case and still faces another half dozen corruption trials.\n\nHe has denied all the charges, arguing they were politically motivated to prevent him from competing in the 2018 election, ultimately won by President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nIf he is released, Lula's criminal record will prevent him from resuming his political career.\n\nThat could change, however, if the Supreme Court were to decide in a separate case that Justice Minister Sergio Moro, who convicted Lula when he was a judge in 2017, had been biased.", "description": "Brazil's Supreme Court said Thursday that it would decide in November on whether to overturn a law requiring convicted criminals to go to jail after losing their first appeal, in a case that could have implications for jailed ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
