Her first award came for showing off her moves. (Jan. 16) AP\n\nJenna Dewan is opening up about her 2018 split from Channing Tatum.\n\nAccording to E! News and Entertainment Tonight, the dancer, 38, writes about \"the separation storm\" in her new book \"Gracefully You: Finding Beauty and Balance in the Everyday.\"\n\n\"I was learning things about my ex most people wouldn't have to face \u2013 and over the internet, as it was happening,\" she writes. \"There I was, on a plane, alone, finding out about his new relationship. I felt blindsided. Choosing grace as I learned everything about my personal situation along with the rest of the world was really difficult.\"\n\nTatum's reported romance with British singer Jessie J made headlines in October 2018, months after he split from Dewan after nearly nine years of marriage.\n\nThe couple have remained coy about their blossoming relationship but have started to open up on social media.\n\nDewan added that she challenged to remain graceful during difficult times.\n\n\"Instead of reacting the way I wanted to... I asked myself this: How do I choose grace in this moment? Had I not been practicing this way of life beforehand, I definitely wouldn't have handled this news very gracefully,\" she said.\n\nShe also described the emotions that she experienced during the split.\n\n\"In the beginning of my separation, it felt as though I were in a dark closet, desperately trying to find the light or the way out. I was in a state of shock,\" she writes. \"One week I'd be doing really well and the next I was slammed with a whole new slew of emotions.\"\n\nShe continued, \"The rumor mill was churning out story after story. There were many times I hid under the covers, wondering what was next. The pain hit me like a tumbling avalanche. I was completely overcome with fear and sadness. It took many moments of sitting alone with my grief to force me into surrendering to my roller coaster of a situation.\"\n\nDewan has had happy news in her life recently, however. She and boyfriend, Steve Kazee, are expecting their first baby together, the couple confirmed to USA TODAY in September.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond overjoyed and couldn\u2019t be happier to be expanding our family!\u201d the couple said in a joint statement.\n\nDewan already shares daughter Everly, 6, with Tatum. This child will be the first for actor Kazee, 43.\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, Amy Haneline\n\n'I didn\u2019t know life without' him: Jenna Dewan was 'just gutted' after Channing Tatum split\n\nBaby alert!
