I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nThe 56-year-old Emmy Award winner pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in May and is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 13.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers believe that one year of probation, 250 hours of community service with an organization that works with at-risk youth in Los Angeles and a $20,000 fine is fair, asserting that similar cases \u201calmost always\u201d result in probation rather than jail time which is \u201cexceptionally rare.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling is pushing for one month of jail time, a year of probation after that and a $20,000 fine, a sentence he says takes into account the fact that Huffman has accepted responsibility for her actions.\n\nLelling says Huffman knew the scheme was wrong and participated in it anyways.\n\n\u201cHer efforts weren\u2019t driven by need or desperation, but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth and insularity,\u201d his office wrote in its filing Friday. \u201cMillions of parents send their kids to college every year. All of them care as much she does about their children\u2019s fortunes. But they don\u2019t buy fake SAT scores.\u201d\n\nUnder federal sentencing guidelines, prosecutors could have sought up to six months of jail time.\n\nMeanwhile, Huffman's actor husband William H. Macy, who wasn\u2019t charged in the scheme, and her \"Desperate Housewives\" co-star Eva Longoria were among two dozen people who submitted letters to the court on her behalf.\n\nMacy detailed his family's struggles in the wake of the scandal, saying that his wife hasn't been able to find work since she was arrested six months ago and her daughter, now in college, has been taking a gap year. He also said Huffman's younger daughter, who is in high school is attending therapy.\n\n\u201cFelicity\u2019s only interest now is figuring out how to make amends and help her daughters heal and move on,\u201d Macy wrote.\n\nIn a two-page letter, Longoria praised her friendship with Huffman calling her a \"gentle character\" with a \"kind heart.\"\n\nLongoria also said of Huffman: \"She always leads with her heart and has always put others first.\"\n\nHuffman is among 51 people charged in a scheme in which prosecutors say wealthy parents paid an admissions consultant to bribe coaches and test administrators to help their children get into prestigious colleges.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHuffman's bribe is among the smaller ones. \"Full House\" star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are charged with paying $500,000 for their two daughters to get into elite universities. Both have pleaded not guilty to charges which include conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and are facing maximum jail sentences of 40 years in prison.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Attornies\u00a0for \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman pleaded with a Boston federal judge\u00a0Friday\u00a0to spare her jail time after she pleaded guilty in connection with the\u00a0college admissions bribery scandal.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
