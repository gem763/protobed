Then they are your rules.\u201d\n\nThe response would be that de-platforming the left is a form of deterrence. If you want them to stop taking scalps from the right, start taking them from the left until they think better of their tactics. One problem with that logic, though, is that you\u2019ll never deter everyone; another problem is that taking scalps in unjust circumstances could backfire by generating greater enthusiasm on the other side for even more ruthless scalp-taking. Although the stakes are obviously way lower, the conflict considerations here aren\u2019t much different than they\u2019d be for a group that\u2019s trying to decide whether to engage in terrorism to advance its cause. Will you gain more for your cause or lose more by responding to violence perpetrated against you with your own violence? Will that violence frighten the enemy into suing for peace or radicalize him into committing to your destruction? As a moral matter, should you be as bad as your enemy or insist on being better and prove how cutthroat he is by the contrast with your example?\n\nI don\u2019t know that Media Matters, say, would mind if scalp-taking became mainstream partisan practice, to the extent that it isn\u2019t already.\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s a difference between what Breitbart did to (now former) U of A dean of students Jamie Riley in this case and what Bloomberg Law did to Leif Olson earlier this week. The apparent intent was the same \u2014 get the target canceled, i.e. fired \u2014 but there\u2019s no evidence that Breitbart misrepresented Riley\u2019s actual views. His tweets were public statements which he chose to publish; and as a dean at a public university he\u2019s a public official, accountable not just to his school but to the broader taxpaying public. It\u2019s fair game to scrutinize the writings of a public official.\n\nBut no, this guy shouldn\u2019t have been fired. At least not without reason to believe that his views had led him to be ineffective in his job.\n\n\u201cThe [American flag emoji] flag represents a systemic history of racism for my people,\u201d Riley wrote in the tweet. \u201cPolice are a part of that system. Is it that hard to see the correlation?\u201d In a separate image of a tweet in October 2017, Riley said white people have \u201c0 opinion\u201d on racism because white people cannot experience racism. \u201cI\u2019m baffled about how the first thing white people say is, \u2018That\u2019s not racist!\u2019 when they can\u2019t even experience racism,\u201d Riley wrote in the tweet. \u201cYou have 0 opinion!\u201d Under the previous tweet, Riley sent a hashtag that read \u201c#missmewithyourprivilege.\u201d Later, an image of a 2016 tweet from Riley shows him questioning the motive of making movies about slavery. \u201cAre movies about slavery truly about educating the unaware, or to remind Black people of our place in society,\u201d Riley wrote.\n\nIf agreeing with the first tweet is a firing offense, every Democrat in the country as well as some Republicans should be fired tomorrow. The third tweet is \u2026 odd. If you\u2019re so woke that you think movies like \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d are actually a tool of The Man to further oppress blacks, you\u2019re too woke. The second tweet is the one that\u2019s a potential issue: If Riley is ignoring white students\u2019 opinions on some subjects like race as a matter of policy, because he thinks whites can\u2019t experience racism or whatever, that\u2019s obviously a problem for a dean whose job is to listen to students.\n\nBut was he actually ignoring anyone? Did Alabama take five seconds to ask students how they felt about him before dropping the axe? Was there any sort of boycott threat that might have required fast action? Or was Riley simply guilty of what tens of millions of people are guilty of every day, having a dickish thought and farting it out on Twitter immediately before thinking better of it later, and no one really cared?\n\nI\u2019m going to share a secret here with America\u2019s institutions, left and right: You don\u2019t need to actually give the other side a scalp when they demand it. If the Labor Department hadn\u2019t been so quick to appease Bloomberg Law, they would have read through Olson\u2019s Facebook posts, realized he was being smeared, and spared themselves several days of bad press by telling Bloomberg to go away instead of firing the poor guy. If Alabama hadn\u2019t been so quick to appease Breitbart, they would have sniffed around to see if Riley\u2019s views on race were affecting his work. If there were reports already floating around that he was treating white students unfairly, it shouldn\u2019t have taken some old tweets to get him fired. If there weren\u2019t any such reports, they could have put out a statement saying \u201chis views are his own and don\u2019t represent the university\u201d and left it there. As it is, I wonder if they\u2019re going to end up in the same unfortunate place that the Labor Department ended up, with people who are outraged by the firing giving the institution more grief than it would have gotten if it had just exercised due diligence before leaping to can someone.\n\nLike I say, it\u2019s fair to call attention to someone\u2019s public statements, which is what righty operatives are also doing now with reporters. And it\u2019s also fair not to fire someone just because a political enemy claims to be offended. Exit question: If righties, who claim to despise \u201ccancel culture,\u201d are going to participate in it ostensibly for the purpose of getting the left to cease using the tactic, what would count as evidence that they\u2019d ceased? Does every \u201cwatchdog\u201d group like Media Matters need to close down? What if that happens and some lefties start freelancing scalp-taking? \u201cWe only do it because the other side does it\u201d is a convenient excuse in some people for \u201cI really enjoy fighting dirty but need a moral fig leaf, like self-defense, to justify it to myself.\u201d", "description": "Fired.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/m.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
