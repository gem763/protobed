Lovotti became the first Italian to be sent off in a Rugby World Cup, and a 14-man Italy\u2019s confidence collapsed. They lost 49-3.\n\nCoach Conor O\u2019Shea was livid, calling the tackle \u201ccrass stupidity,\u201d adding he was \u201cdestroyed for everybody because we worked so hard.\u201d\n\nLock David Sisi, who was replaced soon after the incident, said their hotel on Saturday morning was very quiet.\n\n\u201cWe built towards that goal last night and we talk about moments in sport and, unfortunately, we lost that moment and it has hit us pretty hard,\u201d Sisi said.\n\nThe Italians were rallying around Lovotti who, along with Quaglio, was cited for the tackle. Both face a disciplinary hearing on Sunday in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cLovo has won 30-40 caps for Italy and is an absolute servant for Zebre,\u201d Sisi said of his clubmate. \u201cHe is a hugely experienced player and he doesn\u2019t need anyone to tell him it was a mistake last night.\n\n\u201cWe will wear it as a squad. It affects everyone. We are a very united squad and Lovo off the field is a top bloke and a top player on the field.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a swing like it in my entire playing career. A chance to go within seven points, and then to be playing with 14 men.\n\n\u201cThere were moments of that game when we earned our own momentum and that is what is saddest about it. A lot of hard work went in before that match and we were only five meters away from their line, and it would have been a one-score game and the pressure would have gone back onto South Africa.\u201d\n\nSisi said Italy can\u2019t afford to mope. They have one more pool match left, against defending champion New Zealand next Saturday in Toyota. The Italians have never beaten the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cOur performance is going to be everything for us now,\u201d Sisi said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the (South Africa) match back twice and we did some good things.\n\n\u201cGoing against the No. 1 team is an even bigger challenge. To put in a performance that everyone back home is proud of is our No. 1 goal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Italy woke up on Saturday in Shizuoka and the bitter taste of a wasted opportunity and regret lingered.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
