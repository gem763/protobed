I never had an official offer, because everyone knew that I wanted to be with Barcelona, but it was a situation that went beyond what I felt about the club.\u201d\n\nMessi\u2019s problems with the Spanish authorities started in the 2013-14 season and he eventually received a suspended 21-month jail sentence after being found guilty of defrauding tax authorities of 4.1 million euros (then $4.6 million).\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult time for me and for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on.\u201d\n\nMessi said he felt he was used as an example by Spanish tax authorities because he was the first top player to be targeted.\n\n\u201cIt was really difficult because I was the first one,\u201d Messi said. \u201cThey started with me and then went after everyone else.\u201d\n\nSeveral other players were later accused of wrongdoing by Spanish tax authorities, including former Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMessi said he wished Ronaldo would have stayed at Real Madrid because his presence was good for the Spanish league and the rivalry with Barcelona.\n\nMessi also reiterated his wish to have Neymar back with the club, and that he believed the Brazil forward would have ended up playing for Real Madrid if he didn\u2019t join Barcelona.\n\n\u201cI thought (Real Madrid president) Florentino (P\u00e9rez) would have done something to sign him,\u201d Messi said.\n\nMessi said when former teammate Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez decides to coach Barcelona the team will play similarly to how it did under Pep Guardiola, but he doesn\u2019t know if he will still be playing when that happens.\n\nMessi said his goal is to retire with Barcelona, and he feels the club should have won another Champions League title in the last few years.\n\nThe 32-year-old Argentina playmaker said he is getting to an age in which everything becomes harder on his body, but he will continue evaluating his playing condition year by year.\n\nOn Thursday, Messi is expected to attend the opening Cirque du Soleil show that was inspired by him.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lionel Messi considered leaving Barcelona after being targeted by Spanish tax authorities in the early 2010s.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/spain_soccer_la_liga_02678_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
