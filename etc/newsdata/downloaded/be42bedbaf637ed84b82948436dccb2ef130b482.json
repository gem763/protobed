six of them in 2018 alone.\n\nAnd its ambitions have prompted some concern in key Western powers they are being outplayed by Moscow.\n\nLast year, former US National Security adviser John Bolton announced a new US strategy for Africa, partly aimed at countering both China and Russia.\n\nHowever, a recent editorial in the Washington Post talked of Russia \"aggressively seeking deals and security relationships\" while US influence in the continent continued to decline.\n\nMilitary ties\n\nRussia is an important defence partner for Africa and the major supplier of arms to the region.\n\nBut Africa is not its biggest defence market - that's in Asia.\n\nBetween 2014-18, the African continent - excluding Egypt - accounted for 17% of Russia's major arms exports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nRussia's main arms market is Asia\n\nOf those 17%, most went to Algeria, with the others worth less than 3% of total exports.\n\nSo, in terms of volume, defence exports to sub-Saharan states are small.\n\nHowever, defence relationships are growing - and since 2014, military co-operation agreements have been signed with 19 African countries.\n\nIn 2017-18, Russia had weapons deals with Angola, Nigeria, Sudan, Mali, Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThese included fighter jets, combat and transport helicopters, anti-tank missiles and engines for fighter planes.\n\nUse of mercenaries\n\nRussia's military and security ties extend beyond arms exports and sometimes involve the use of private mercenary groups.\n\nFor example, Russia has been active in the Central African Republic (CAR), officially helping to support the embattled UN-backed government against an array of rebel groups.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Private Russian military provides security in the Central African Republic\n\nBut private Russian military forces have also been working there, providing security to the government and helping safeguard key economic assets.\n\nRussian mercenary activity has also been reported in neighbouring Sudan and Libya as well as in other countries, involving Wagner, a private military company said to have ties to the Kremlin.\n\nRussian officials often play down these reports and it's difficult to establish the exact links between these groups and the Russian state.\n\nBut Paul Stronski, senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says private Russian security operatives serve a useful purpose for Moscow.\n\nThey are often self-financing through their work guarding key resources and give the Russian state the chance \"to expand its security presence and political influence in the country at virtually no cost and little risk\", he says.\n\nNatural resources\n\nRussia has clear economic motives for involvement in Africa, as it has a shortage of some minerals such as manganese, bauxite and chromium, all of which are important for industry.\n\nIt also has experience in the energy sector it can offer to resource-rich states.\n\nImage copyright Petra Diamonds Image caption Diamond mining is one area of interest for Russia\n\nState-owned Russian companies have been mining bauxite in Guinea, cutting deals to extract diamonds from Angola and winning concessions to produce off-shore gas in Mozambique.\n\nThe private Russian energy giant Lukoil is reported to have projects in Cameroon, Ghana and Nigeria and be looking to acquire a stake in the Republic of Congo.\n\nRussia is also offering nuclear power technology for several African countries, including the construction next year of the first nuclear plant in Egypt, financed by a $25bn (\u00a319bn) loan.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa trading partners\n\nTrading relationships\n\nBut in terms of overall economic ties, Russia still does much more trade with Europe and Asia than with Africa.\n\nAnd sub-Saharan Africa's most important trading relationships in 2017 were with India, China and the US - not Russia.\n\nAlso the US, China, Japan and the EU give far more development aid and invest more in Africa than Russia does.\n\n\"Russia is nowhere near restoring the status that the Soviet Union once enjoyed on the continent,\" Mr Stronski says.\n\n\"Russia's clout in Africa remains tied to a handful of client states with relatively limited strategic significance.\"\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "Will Russia's renewed interest in Africa make it a key player in the region?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F2DB/production/_109317126_mi-8_russia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
