Once again, I literally could not believe my eyes in the so-called paper of record.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the very first sentence which says that president trump and his allies or I guess anyone who doesn't like Elizabeth warren\" has quote \"struggled for months to come up with effective ways to confront Elizabeth warren.\" Uh, no they haven't had to struggle. The issue is right there glaring us all in the face. She lied about her heritage for decades to advance her career and appear special. She clung to those lies for years and only half fessed up to it when she decided to run for president.\n\nThe New York times literally cannot reconcile itself with the fact that she even lied about her heritage, in their own story they claim that she apparently proved her Native American heritage with a DNA test that showed she might be approximately 1/1024th Native American, aka not Native American. It is gaslighting before your very eyes and it\u2019s shameful.\n\nTheir comparison to prove that concerns about her authenticity are a sexist trope? Well they point to....Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton'Lock him up' chant erupts at Trump rally after Eric Trump attacks Biden Minneapolis mayor proclaims 'Love Trumps Hate Day' ahead of Trump visit Krystal Ball: Lauer rape allegations represent 'ugly underbelly' of news outlets MORE. I mean my god. It\u2019s not sexist to call inauthentic people inauthentic. How many different idealogical versions did we see of Hillary through the years? Are they really going to make me play the clip of her with a fake southern accent? Ok fine, lets\u2019 roll the tape\n\nThis has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with a pattern of dishonesty and misrepresenting your past. Perhaps that\u2019s why some of us are a teeny tiny bit skeptical when Elizabeth Warren's claims don't appear to 100% match up with things that she said in the past about being fired from her job.\n\nBut this has a lot more to do with just her heritage, it\u2019s also about how she's carried herself since ascending to high office. She was the progressive warrior who endorsed Hillary Clinton and took big money cash for her campaign for years. until she swore it off for the primary, but then said she'd leave the door open for the general election if she was the nominee.\n\nWednesday she came out and said well she'll swear off the big money personally but her campaign clarified that she would still do them for the DNC? Oh ok, I guess that\u2019s the fundamental sea change in American politics that people were looking for. Krystal also pointed out that she swore off big money only after it was proven that she could make sufficient cash from it.\n\nJournalist Zaid Jilani has also pointed out that warren has far from committed herself to Medicare for all with her recent \"framework\" comment and may even be opening the door to expanded Medicaid type coverage. A far cry from the Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders opens up about heart attack in attempt to assuage health concerns 2020 Presidential Candidates Sanders support ticks up among college students following heart attack MORE proposal.\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the 10-million-dollar ad buy and pledge to root out corruption in Washington while utterly refusing to condemn the former vice president's son from cashing in on his father's office. I could go on and on and on. There are plenty of reasons not to trust Elizabeth Warren. the Native American heritage scandal just shows us that it\u2019s not just in politics that we can't take her word.\n\nGuess I'm a disgusting sexist for pointing all of this out according to The New York times.", "description": "Opinion by: Saagar EnjetiIt seems I can't stop talking about The New York times here for my monologues, but they just keep making such egregious mistakes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_10022019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
