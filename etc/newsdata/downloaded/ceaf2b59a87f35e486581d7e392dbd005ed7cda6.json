Instead, investors are typically locked into a fund for anything up to five to seven years, and, in return, they hope to harvest what\u2019s called the \u201cilliquidity premium\u201d.\n\nBecause of that illiquidity, returns from private equity can be totally unrelated to sharemarkets, which can be handy when markets correct and a chunk of an investor's portfolio barely moves. It\u2019s close to the holy grail of \u201cequity-like returns with bond-like volatility\u201d that so many investors dream about.\n\nWith the huge rise in popularity of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors over the past 10 years, there\u2019s likewise been a huge rise in the amount of money chasing private assets. It\u2019s estimated there\u2019s $US5 trillion ($7.4 trillion) locked away in private equity funds already.\n\nPrequin, an alternative asset analyst, found more than half the large pension funds and family offices it surveyed intended to increase their allocation.\n\nIntense competition\n\nOf that $US5 trillion, $US2 trillion is \"dry powder\" that hasn\u2019t been invested yet and the intense competition for assets has seen the multiples paid rise by 20 per cent over the past eight years. After the global financial crisis, US regulators guided private equity firms to paying no more than six times EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, a proxy measure for how much cash a business spits out), but recently almost 40 per cent of deals have been done at more than seven times.\n\nWhile that may not sound like much, it\u2019s a 17 per cent rise. Further, many firms are looking to maintain strong returns on higher-priced acquisitions by jacking up debt. That has resulted in average debt multiples rising by 20 per cent over the past few years. In that time household names like Debenhams, Toys R Us and Pizza Express have collapsed under the weight of the debt piled on by their private equity owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeWork debacle\n\nIn January Japan\u2019s Softbank, one of the biggest private equity firms in the world, put money into WeWork at a valuation of $US47 billion. In the build up to listing the company in the US, the way many private equity firms realise their profit, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan valued it at $US50 billion to $US60 billion. But, after closer scrutiny by regulators and fund managers, the deal was pulled and the valuation is now estimated at more like $US10 billion.\n\nThat came after another private equity darling, Uber, was valued last year at $US120 billion, then listed at $US80 billion, and is now worth $US50 billion. Likewise, the valuation of its competitor, Lyft, has fallen by 40 per cent since it listed six months ago.\n\nHaving exposure to private equity in a portfolio can be great for returns and can reduce volatility. But investors really need to know what they are buying first. There are some companies that run smoothly, others that grab headlines for what can be the wrong reasons and others that are clearly trying to jump on the bandwagon to raise money. The low interest rate environment is a double tailwind for private equity: lower yields are encouraging investors to look elsewhere for a return boost and debt is cheap. Just make sure you don\u2019t get blown off course.\n\nJames Weir is a director of Steward Wealth.", "description": "The low interest rate environment is a double tailwind for private equity: lower yields are encouraging investors to look elsewhere for a return boost and debt is cheap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_47/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8a3c575974e48409683c9553933702c74d42cf58", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
