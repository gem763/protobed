The Luton striker, who scored as a substitute on his debut in last month\u2019s friendly win over Bulgaria, was named in the starting line-up at the Boris Paichadze Arena, one of three changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Switzerland.\n\nCollins came in for the injured David McGoldrick, while Matt Doherty replaced suspended left-back Enda Stevens and John Egan took over from Richard Keogh in central defence.\n\nThe home side signalled their intent from the off when Valeri Qazaishvili exchanged passes with Jano Ananidze on the edge of the area only to slash his shot wide under pressure.\n\nGeorgia v Republic of Ireland: Euro 2020 qualifier \u2013 live!

Ireland face Denmark and Switzerland in their remaining games knowing they will need to take something from them.", "description": "Republic of Ireland\u2019s 0-0 draw in Georgia maintains their strong position in Euro 202 Group D", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52934ab8844e463a827bf71a4d035359a2be8cb5/0_79_3417_2050/master/3417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=219c9e74133aaac7fc459b63347e37f9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
