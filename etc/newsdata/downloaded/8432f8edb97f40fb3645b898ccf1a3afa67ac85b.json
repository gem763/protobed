You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, this sentiment was lost on several befuddled Twitter users.\n\n\u201cWhy are you using vegan cheese on a burger that already HAS meat in it?!\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of this? Why not offer a meat burger AND a plant-based burger? That way you can appeal to meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. This hybrid burger cuts your market significantly,\u201d another wrote.\n\nIn a blog post shared on the BrewDog website, the pub chain outlined how the target demographic for the Hybrid Burger is \u201cthose who want to reduce their intake and their footprint on the environment\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs we are in the grip of a climate emergency, the more people who eat less meat the better. That is why we have launched this fresh take on flexitarianism,\u201d the company wrote.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make a burger that delivered on flavour and enabled anyone to make a transition to eating less animal-based protein.\u201d\n\nIn March, a study conducted by YouGov discovered that 14 per cent of people in the UK identify as \u201cflexitarians\u201d, which is when people follow predominantly meat-free diets, although they eat meat on occasion.\n\nWhile many of the responses to the BrewDog Hybrid Burger criticised the concept, there were some Twitter users who defended the idea.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I really don\u2019t see how it tackles sexism or the gender pay gap. Doesn\u2019t this label and name just perpetuate sexism further?\u201d one critic tweeted.\n\nEarlier this year, a man successfully sued BrewDog for sex discrimination after a bartender refused to sell him the discounted Pink IPA.\n\nThe customer in question, Dr Thomas Bower, said he felt \u201cforced\u201d to identify as female in order to purchase the drink.", "description": "BrewDog has sparked bewilderment with the launch of a hybrid burger\u00a0that is half vegan, half beef.
