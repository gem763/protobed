McDonald\u2019s Singapore, Facebook screengrabs\n\nMcDonald\u2019s fans in Singapore have gone from excited to angry, after the fast food giant\u2019s online platforms appeared to crash under pressure created by its highly-hyped up loungewear collection launch.\n\nThe restaurant chain had on Thursday (Oct 3) announced the introduction of McDelivery Night In, which was to be marked the following Monday evening with a new limited-stock loungewear set and an eye mask for sleeping.\n\nAs expected, fans were ready way before the 6pm launch on McDelivery\u2019s web and mobile platforms.\n\nBut in the end, demand for the burger and fries-themed clothing proved to be too overwhelming for McDonald\u2019s servers to handle, and some fans were already complaining of issues with the service by 6pm.\n\nWhen Business Insider tried to access the McDelivery platforms at 6.15pm, we were greeted by a \u201cService Unavailable\u201d message.\n\nNeedless to say, customers were livid. It didn\u2019t take long for angry comments to flood McDonald\u2019s Facebook page, warning others of bad experiences and demanding an explanation from the fast food chain.\n\nMany people were upset after waiting for hours and successfully making orders, only to be told that their orders could not be fulfilled. A handful also complained of errors that prevented them from placing orders.\n\nSome called out McDonald\u2019s for staying silent on the issue, only posting two updates to apologise for the downtime on its web and mobile platforms. What McDonald\u2019s needed to do, they said, was to simply announce on social media if the loungewear sets were sold out.\n\nMany were further agitated when other users reported seeing the loungewear sets \u2013 sold by McDonald\u2019s as part of a bundle for $24.90 \u2013 listed on e-marketplace Carousell for S$50 to S$70 each.\n\nA set of two was priced as much as S$165. Screengrab from Carousell\n\nAnd there were a few who referenced similar marketing events which angered customers after brands failed to fully meet demand for limited-time promotions and items.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Singapore had yet to say if the loungewear sets were sold out as of 11am on Tuesday (Oct 8) morning, but a notice on its mobile app said they were now \u201ctemporarily unavailable\u201d due to \u201coverwhelming support\u201d.\n\nIt also told customers to check the McDonald\u2019s Facebook page \u2013 which had not been updated since the night before \u2013 for further updates.\n\nScreengrab from McDonald\u2019s Singapore app\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to Mcdonald\u2019s Singapore\u2019s publicist for comments.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"Nobody learns from the Huawei fiasco,\" one person wrote..
