Men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis. One unit equals 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol, which is around the amount of alcohol the average adult can process in an hour. A pint of strong lager contains 3 units of alcohol, whereas the same volume of low-strength lager has just over 2 units. Some measurements include: Single small shot of spirits (25ml, ABV 40 per cent) - one unit Small glass of red/white/ros\u00e9 wine (125ml, ABV 12 per cent)- 1.5 units Bottle of lager/beer/cider (330ml, ABV five per cent) - 1.7 units Can of lager/beer/cider (440ml, ABV 5.5 per cent) - two units Pint of higher-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 5.2 per cent) - three units Large glass of red/white/ros\u00e9 wine (250ml, ABV 12 per cent) - three units Use Alcohol Concern's unit calculator to measure units. Source: NHS\n\nThe study examined 9,776,956 individuals without AF who underwent a national health check-up in 2009.\n\nThey were asked how many times they indulged per week, the amount of alcohol in each session, and the amount overall.\n\nThe participants were followed up until 2017 to see if they had a diagnosis of AF.\n\nThe number of drinking sessions per week was the strongest risk factor for AF, the findings show.\n\nConsuming large amounts per session, which is 'binge drinking', did not show any links to AF, the researchers said.\n\nThose who drank twice a week had the lowest risk for AF. Therefore, they were set as a reference point.\n\nParticipants who drank once a week had a nine per cent higher chance of AF in comparison.\n\nThose who drank six times a week had a 30 per cent higher risk of AF, and those who drank every day had a 40 per cent higher risk.\n\nPatients who never drank had a slightly higher likelihood of AF than those who drank twice a week.\n\nThe researchers did not explain why this might be, however, moderate alcohol is considered to have some health benefits.\n\nDr Choi said: 'Our study suggests that frequent drinking is more dangerous than infrequent binge drinking with regard to AF.\n\n'The number of drinking sessions was related to atrial fibrillation onset regardless of age and sex.\n\n'Repeated episodes of atrial fibrillation triggered by alcohol may lead to overt disease.\n\n'In addition, drinking can provoke sleep disturbance which is a known risk factor for atrial fibrillation.'\n\nIn keeping with previous studies, the total amount of alcohol consumed over a week was related to AF.\n\nThere was a two per cent increase in the risk of new-onset AF for each gram of alcohol consumed per week.\n\nThere are eight grams of alcohol in one unit. A spirit shot is one unit, a pint of higher-strength beer or large glass of wine is three units.\n\nUsing mild drinkers (less than 105g/13.1 units a week) as a reference group, heavy drinkers (more than 210g/26.2 units a week) had a 21.5 per cent higher risk of AF.\n\nNon drinkers had an 8.6 per cent higher risk and moderate drinkers (105 - 210g a week) had a 7.7 per cent higher risk.\n\nDr Choi recommended considering both how much and how often you are drinking if you are concerned about heart rhythm disorders.\n\nHe said: 'Alcohol consumption is probably the most easily modifiable risk factor. To prevent new-onset atrial fibrillation, both the frequency and weekly amount of alcohol consumption should be reduced.\n\n'Atrial fibrillation is a disease with multiple dreadful complications and significantly impaired quality of life.'\n\nAF is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, affecting around one million people in the UK, and 2.7million in the US.\n\nAround seven in 100 people aged over 65 are diagnosed.\n\nSufferers can have an irregular pulse, shortness of breath, chest pain and tiredness.\n\nThe study was published in EP Europace, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).", "description": "Researchers in South Korea studied drinking habits of almost 10million people.
