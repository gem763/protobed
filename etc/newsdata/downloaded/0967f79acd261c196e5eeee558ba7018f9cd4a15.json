The government backed down but abortion remains illegal in most circumstances and the current parliament is making moves to restrict access even further.\n\nEnter the Berlin-based activist group Ciocia Basia.\n\nTheir mission? To help women in Poland access abortions \u2013 in Germany.\n\nThe clue to what makes Ciocia Basia unique is in the name, which means \u201cAunt Basia\u201d in Polish. The suggestion of a warm, supportive and trustworthy older relative is no accident.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They asked only their first names be used.\n\n\u201cHaving to get this procedure abroad is stressful, so we\u2019re there to comfort them and help make sure everything is organised so they don\u2019t have to do anything other than to come here and have the procedure,\u201d Ann tells The Independent.\n\nThe women find Ciocia Basia online or through word of mouth, and demand for their help is growing.\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest governmental report, we had about 1,000 legal abortions in 2018,\u201d says Krystyna Kacpura, executive director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning NGO in Poland.\n\n\u201cWe have five million women of reproductive age, limited access to contraception \u2013 especially emergency contraception \u2013 and no sexual education.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine 1,000 abortions in a country with five million women? No.\u201d\n\nKacpura estimates that roughly 150,000 Polish women have abortions each year, using pills, illegal private clinics, or going abroad.\n\n\u201cWe call this abortion migration or abortion tourism,\u201d she adds.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But exposing the victims of Poland\u2019s abortion law is a challenge.\n\nWhile there has been pushback from pro-choice protesters, social pressure creates an environment where women are often too frightened and ashamed to speak about their experience of abortion \u2013 even anonymously.\n\n\u201cSometimes we ask for a couple of sentences for other women, and it\u2019s impossible because she just wants to forget,\u201d Kacpura says.\n\nWomen who come to Ciocia Basia feel the weight of that pressure. They always want to explain their decision, even though the volunteers never ask.\n\nAleksandra says that the reasons they give are incredibly varied, whether \u201cfinancial, being too young, being too old, having a horrible relationship\u201d.\n\nTrauma is the main framing within the Polish discourse about abortion Aleksandra, Ciocia Basia\n\nAbout 50 per cent of the women arrive on their own, and often haven\u2019t told their family or partner.\n\n\u201cI translate for them at the clinic and usually there\u2019s a general feeling of shame and secrecy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re usually tense in the beginning but after they see it\u2019s treated like a normal medical procedure and everyone is treating them kindly, they relax.\u201d\n\nMaking abortion seem shadowy and disreputable is seen as one of the most powerful tools of the anti-abortion movement.\n\nAbortion pills such as misoprostol can be discretely provided by pro-choice organisations such as Women on Web \u2013 anti-abortion groups may not be able to completely prevent access, but they can weaponise shame to control the discourse surrounding the procedure.\n\nAnn describes one Polish woman\u2019s experience of searching for information about abortion: \u201cShe was like, \u2018You have no idea how many names I got called, [people saying] I should die and rot in hell.\n\n\u201cThen you find Ciocia Basia and everyone gives you the feeling that you are welcome, that your situation is normal, that you\u2019re not a devil just because you want to have a medical procedure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of not taking women seriously, not trusting them with their choices,\u201d Aleksandra says.\n\nShe was raised in Poland and blames the influence of the Catholic church for stigmatising abortion. \u201cThis is one of the main topics that they talk about, it\u2019s just a huge deal. For some reason, their main ideological goal is to eradicate abortion access completely.\u201d\n\nBoth she and Ann express frustration at the misinformation surrounding the procedure.\n\n\u201cTrauma is the main framing within the Polish discourse about abortion. Even liberal media perpetuates the myth that it always has to be this traumatic experience, although various studies have shown that the trauma is associated with stigma and not being able to talk to your family,\u201d Aleksandra says.\n\nYou have no idea how many names I got called, people saying I should die and rot in hell Anonymous client at Ciocia Basia\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of weird dichotomies like \u2018people who get abortions versus mothers\u2019. People don\u2019t realise that\u2019s often the same person but at different life stages.\n\n\u201cI often have mothers who already know how much time, stress and emotion it takes to raise a child, and they\u2019re like \u2018I cannot do this again, I already have five kids.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking openly about abortion is part of the new wave of activism, as pro-choice groups across the continent come together to defend reproductive rights.\n\nThe UK-based Abortion Support Network was the main inspiration for Ciocia Basia. Now, their organisation is part of a larger European network with the same pro-choice goal.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like a future where groups like ours are necessary,\u201d Aleksandra says, \u201cbut if it goes the way it\u2019s going now, then I hope more will start.\u201d", "description": "Across the globe, the rise of right-wing parties has stirred up the fight over abortion.
