It\u2019s fine margins, and if he can\u2019t, that opens the door to other scenarios including an election, a second referendum, or even a move to leave the EU with no agreement in place.\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s accord has lowered the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, the risks \u201care not mathematically zero,\u201d say strategists at Toronto-Dominion Bank, including Ned Rumpeltin.\n\n\u201cAny positions predicated on an imminent no-deal crash-out look difficult to countenance at this stage,\u201d said Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at TD. \u201cLooking forward however, we think it is still a little too early to sound an unqualified all-clear.\u201d\n\nIf Parliament does manage to pass the deal this week, the pound could test May\u2019s peak of around $1.3185, the TD strategists forecast, though they see it struggling to move higher in the absence of fresh catalysts.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management is more bullish. It\u2019s retaining an overweight position in sterling against the dollar, said Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele. A \u201cconvincing deal\u201d could drive the pound to $1.35, he predicted.\n\nJohnson needs 61 of 85 possible votes from potential swing lawmakers, a tight but feasible number. One blow is that Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, with 10 potential supporters, came out firmly against the deal.\n\nIf lawmakers were to reject it and that led to an extension beyond the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, the risk of a general election would \u201csuck the wind\u201d out of sterling\u2019s rally and see it test $1.2640-60, the TD strategists predict. And that level could come under significant pressure if Parliament\u2019s blocking of the deal were followed by the EU rejecting a request for an extension to the Brexit deadline.\n\nOther scenarios -- including a potential second referendum that could cancel Brexit altogether, or an election that could cement Johnson\u2019s leadership and seal his deal -- cannot be ruled out either.\n\nNo wonder implied volatility on sterling is so high and risk gauges are swinging back and forth. And adding to the drama, the currency market won\u2019t get its first chance to react to the twists and turns of the weekend until trading resumes at 7 p.m. local time (or 7 a.m. in Auckland), when liquidity can be limited and exacerbate price swings.\n\n\u201cNo deal remains a threat until either a deal or no Brexit is completed,\u201d Rumpeltin said. \u201cAn unexpected jump to an alternative scenario would quickly return both rates and FX to the state of confusion and -- often -- contradiction that has defined much of the Brexit process so far.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Anooja Debnath in London at adebnath@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Dobson at pdobson2@bloomberg.net, Neil Chatterjee\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Currency strategists are ruling nothing out for Saturday\u2019s crucial parliamentary vote on Britain\u2019s deal to exit the European Union -- and that makes forecasting where sterling will settle something of a crapshoot.The pound could surge to $1.35 or slip to around $1.26, strategists and fund", "authors": ["Anooja Debnath"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f5yJCBeZnDz3wr0nRlcWFA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/524c81401232f0f74fc813db55c5d180", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
