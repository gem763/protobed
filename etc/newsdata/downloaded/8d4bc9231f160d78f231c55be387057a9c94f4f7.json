He didn\u2019t appreciate being held accountable for his record on votes concerning the LGBTQ community during a forum in Iowa Friday. His exchange with a female moderator is being described as \u201ctense\u201d.\n\nLyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist, asked Biden about his support of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 and the military\u2019s Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell policy in 1994, during his time in the Senate. She then tossed in his past comment that Vice-President Mike Pence was a \u201cdecent guy\u201d. Pence is a persona non grata for the intolerant. The audience booed at the mention of Pence. So, as a life-long politician is prone to do, he turned it back on his questioner. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person.\u201d Yikes! She responded by saying, \u201cJust asking the questions people want to know.\u201d\n\nAn attention grabbing moment from Biden\u2019s time on stage when moderator \u2066@lyzl\u2069 pushed Biden on past votes and calling \u2066@VP\u2069 a \u201cdecent guy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d Biden tells the moderator to laugher. \u201cJust asking the questions people want to know,\u201d she replied pic.twitter.com/DB10NGuBCP \u2014 Molly Nagle (@MollyNagle3) September 21, 2019\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he just reach over and pat her on her head? He smiled, as though that would soften up his sexist response. Lenz did not take kindly to the slam masked with a phony smile, as you would imagine. Then to add fuel to the fire, as they were walking off the stage, he said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re a real sweetheart.\u201d\n\nAs I was walking off the stage with @JoeBiden he said to me dryly, \"You're a real sweetheart.\" #LGBTQforum \u2014 Lyz a real sweetheart (@lyzl) September 21, 2019\n\nWas it a gotcha series of questions? Yes, it was. So what? His supporters are getting pissy with her for asking the questions in their responses on Twitter (note that she is using \u201creal sweetheart\u201d in her Twitter handle today) as though gotcha questions are not part of any political interview. In something as important as the race for a political party\u2019s presidential nomination, all candidates have to be prepared for all kinds of snark and being held accountable for past political actions, especially Joe Biden. Biden has been a member of the swamp for over forty years, for fark\u2019s sake. He\u2019s not new here.\n\nShe found Biden\u2019s remarks as \u201ccondescending\u201d. Biden went on to one-up Barack Obama on his early support of same-sex marriage. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to evolve.\u201d\n\nBiden is rapidly proving to be the Hillary Clinton candidate of 2020. He\u2019s old and been a swamp creature for way too long. Now he feels entitled to the nomination and the presidency. Biden doesn\u2019t think he needs to be questioned on anything along the way. It\u2019s the kind of arrogance that happens when politicians past their expiration date refuse to just get off the stage.\n\nGrandpa Joe still has the lead in Iowa with 24.5% in the Real Clear Politics average. Elizabeth Warren is at 20.8%, in second place.\n\nThe big political event this weekend in Iowa happens today with the Iowa Steak Fry. Maybe Joe can smooth things over with the ladies.\n\nUndecided voters like Elphic can show up to another big political event on Saturday: the Iowa Steak Fry, where organizers grill 10,500 steaks for more than 12,000 attendees, who will get to hear from 17 candidates. The event will also have 1,000 vegan burgers, all of it made on 10 grills by 40 grillers.\n\nI\u2019ll be here with the popcorn.", "description": "Sexism with a smile?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/894be475-4a0d-496f-9b9e-8a6d5804c00a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
