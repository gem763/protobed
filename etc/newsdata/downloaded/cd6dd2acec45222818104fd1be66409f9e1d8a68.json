The company also owns 2 World Trade Center but the building itself is only built to street level currently. Once they find an anchor tenant, it will undergo construction.\n\nIn this June 7, 2018 photo, One World Trade Center towers over its neighbors, including 3 World Trade Center, center, an 80-story office building in New York.

After the attacks, which destroyed the site's most iconic buildings, the company began working on the office portion of a replacement complex.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the biggest challenge of my life, and it\u2019s only taken us 18 years to this point,\u201d Silverstein told FOX Business\u2019 Stuart Varney in Febuary. Leasing at the site is booming, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7 World Trade Center, which opened in May 2006 and cost approximately $1 billion, was the first office tower rebuilt at the site, and its earliest tenant, Moody\u2019s, signed a lease for 750,000 square feet of space. The building now hosts the New York Academy of Sciences, Mansueto Ventures, MSCI and WilmerHale as well.\n\nThe tower at 3 World Trade, which cost approximately $2.5 billion, is filling up quickly and recently signed a rental agreement with a law firm, putting occupancy close to 60 percent, according to the Silver Properties. Other tenants signing a lease this year include Casper, Diageo, Better Mortgage and Hudson River Trading.\n\nIts neighbor, 4 World Trade, which cost approximately $2 billion, is 100 percent leased, with Spotify being the anchor tenant, the company said.\n\nThe Perelman Performing Arts Center, located at the northeast corner of the site, is under construction and expected to open around the 20th anniversary of the attacks in September 2021.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The anniversary of 9/11, when America remembers the deadliest attack on its soil in history,\u00a0is an appropriate time to look up Larry Silverstein.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/larry-silverstein-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
