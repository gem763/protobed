The news came just a day after video footage from northern Syria showed U.S. forces moving back into the area, after their abrupt withdrawal a little more than a week ago.\n\nThe mission to take out al-Baghdadi was a tactical success and no tears should be shed for his death. But this changes nothing about the security situation in Syria. By putting troops back in Syria, President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE is again needlessly putting U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamTrump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Graham: Trump's worst critics should say 'well done Mr. President' White House releases photo of Trump, advisers monitoring al-Baghdadi raid in Situation Room MORE (R-S.C.) and officials in the Pentagon intentionally brought the subject of oil to the president as a means to convince him to send troops back into Syria, given his past obsession with expropriating oil from the Middle East. But that argument was just a ploy. The establishment in Washington doesn\u2019t ever want to leave Syria, oil or no oil. They don\u2019t want to imagine a world where the U.S. doesn\u2019t at least attempt to run the show.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision to re-enter Syria is a mistake. There is no coherent security rationale for doing so. There\u2019s nothing to gain and no geopolitical prize to be won. Withdrawal was and remains the correct policy.\n\nThe chorus of criticism over the past year for the president\u2019s admittedly confused Syria policy is twofold. Hawks in Washington are worried about a Syria that has Russian troops on its soil \u2014 with an official invitation from Damascus.\n\nThe lack of American presence is wrongly seen as capitulating to Putin and increasing Russian power vis-a-vis the U.S. The critics also wrongly contend that ISIS will re-emerge following their fall of their caliphate earlier this year, and pose a threat to the U.S.\n\nBoth are terrible reasons for staying in Syria.\n\nRussia has a long history of influence in Syria and is geographically much closer \u2014 Assad invited them in to help win the civil war. That support is unlikely to end anytime soon. That alone makes Syria a poor arena from which to try to compete with the Russians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn top of that, Syria is also a poor and fractured state. It has limited oil and gas revenue, and it is unlikely they would cede that to partners, as it needs it for its own reconstruction. All that Syria has to offer outsiders is a chance to participate in a sectarian civil war. If Russia wants to get bogged down in the Middle East, the U.S. should not stop them.\n\nConcerns about ISIS are also overblown and not a good reason to stay in Syria. It is true that ISIS has not disappeared. And they never will. Defining defeat as their total elimination and that a presence in Syria is necessary until then is the very definition of a \u201cforever war\u201d and is a recipe for failure. Military force can\u2019t totally kill ISIS \u2014 it is at its most basic a set of ideas.\n\nMeanwhile, local actors are able to handle what is left of ISIS. All of the various regional powers involved in the conflict in Syria \u2014 Damascus, Moscow, Tehran, and Ankara \u2014 are all enemies of the radical group and do not want them to re-establish their caliphate anymore than the U.S. does. ISIS is a regional threat and should be treated as such.\n\nOnly when there is a credible and actionable threat from the region should the U.S. even consider getting involved, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean ground troops. The U.S.\u2019s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities allow it to monitor and strike at threats from afar, with proper legal authority.\n\nLimited, one-off raids, such as the one that took out al-Baghdadi on Saturday, are also acceptable \u2014 again, with proper legal authority and so long as there are no intentions to turn it into an open-ended policing mission.\n\nSyria is not a prize for anyone. There is no reason for an indefinite U.S. presence there. President Trump should stop caving to the establishment and actually \u2014 finally \u2014 withdraw.\n\nJerrod A.
