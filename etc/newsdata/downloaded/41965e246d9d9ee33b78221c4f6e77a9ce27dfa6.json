While the House has passed 10 of the 12 annual appropriations bills, many of those are loaded up with Democratic priorities that make them dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellJonathan Van Ness meets with Nancy Pelosi to discuss the Equality Act Senate confirms Trump's Army secretary nominee The Hill's 12:30 Report: Intel chief defends handling of whistleblower complaint MORE (R-Ky.) and his Republican colleagues have failed to pass any of their funding bills, due in part to some Democratic roadblocks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSenate Democrats are fuming after Republicans pushed top-line spending numbers for the 12 bills through the Appropriations Committee on party lines, and appropriated $12 billion toward Trump's border wall.\n\nThat includes $5 billion in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bill, $3.6 billion in reprogramming in the military construction and Veterans Affairs bill and an additional $3.6 billion to \u201cback fill\u201d the military construction money shifted toward the wall as part of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nThe Senate's $5 billion for the wall is in stark contrast to the DHS bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee, a measure that would not provide additional barrier funding.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOffice of Director of National Intelligence not planning to release whistleblower complaint GOP House Intel member says whistleblower complaint should be made public Whistleblower complaint concerns Trump communications with Ukraine leader MORE (D-N.Y.) acknowledged that the CR was the \u201ceasy part\u201d of funding the government.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is getting the bipartisan appropriations process back on track here in the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Leader McConnell, Chairman Shelby and our Republican colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to sit down with Democrats and get a bipartisan process moving again.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee has passed 10 of the 12 funding bills, teeing up potential legislation for floor action.

Leahy and Schumer both have indicated they would do this,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI see no reason that we couldn\u2019t move some of these bills.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if McConnell is on board with the strategy. Spokesmen for the GOP leader didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRepublicans view the defense bill as a top priority, and letting other bills move forward could lessen the GOP\u2019s leverage to force Democrats to the table on Pentagon spending.\n\nSen.

But pressed how he responded, Leahy rolled his eyes and made a noncommittal noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a decision he has to make, but I think every Republican, every Democrat I\u2019ve talked to says let\u2019s bring them up,\u201d he said of the noncontroversial bills.\n\nStaffers on the Senate and House Appropriations Committee have also started, in the words of Shelby, \u201cserious\u201d negotiations about how to jumpstart the fiscal 2020 spending bills. Even if the Senate is able to get its own spending legislation moving, the House and Senate will need to reconcile their competing bills and work out differences on top-line spending.\n\nA House Democratic aide confirmed that staff have been talking, but characterized the talks as \u201cpreliminary,\u201d suggesting lawmakers are far from a deal to avoid another shutdown fight days before Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cThere have been preliminary staff level discussions on priorities for each side and how best to proceed with talks. There have been no negotiations on individual appropriations bills,\u201d the aide said.\n\nSome senators have started reaching out individually to their House counterparts in an effort to start laying the groundwork in case there is a deal.\n\nBlunt met with Rep.
