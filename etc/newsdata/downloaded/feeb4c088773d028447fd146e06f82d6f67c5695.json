Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMeghan Markle, the wife of Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, sat in the player\u2019s box of her good friend Williams as she took on Canada\u2019s Bianca Andreescu in the women\u2019s final on Saturday.\n\nThe presence of the Duchess of Sussex heaps even greater significance on what could be a memorable tennis occasion as Williams looks to add her name to the record books by equaling Margaret Court\u2019s tally of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nWhile the sight of royalty at Wimbledon is as common as strawberries and cream, Markle\u2019s appearance in New York is sure to stun, even among the throngs of A-listers that regularly flock to the tournament.\n\nShe is not, however, the first royal to appear at the final Grand Slam tournament of the year.\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York attended the men\u2019s semi-final match between Rafa Nadal and Juan Martin del Potro in 2017 and Queen Sofia of Spain attended the 2013 men\u2019s final to support Nadal, tournament organizers said.\n\nYet Markle stands apart as one of the most recognizable faces in the world, after her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, an event that commanded the global spotlight.\n\n\u2018I USED TO CALL YOU MEGHAN\u2019\n\nWilliams has a long-standing and well-documented friendship with Markle, with the six-times U.S. Open champion attending her royal wedding last year and, according to numerous media reports, co-hosting her baby shower in New York.\n\nShe celebrated the release of Markle\u2019s cookbook a year ago in a Twitter post that pulled back the curtain on her friendship with the former actress.\n\n\u201cI used to call you Meghan (and I still do) but dear Duchess of Sussex your first project \u2018Together\u2019 a cookbook bringing women of all cultures together. I could not be more excited about it and proud of you,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nMarkle, appearing an equally devoted friend, made the last-minute decision to fly to the Big Apple after seeing Williams beat Elina Svitolina in her semi-final, according to the Times.\n\nOn Saturday, she commands one of the most sought-after spots in sport.\n\nDemand for tickets to see whether Williams could capture an elusive record-equaling 24th major title was at a similar level to a year ago when she fell in the final to Naomi Osaka.\n\nYet demand for tickets to this year\u2019s showpiece match was 33% higher than in 2017 when Williams did not play in the final, according to StubHub.\n\nThe retailer showed tickets costing hundreds of dollars just to get into the Flushing Meadows facility on Saturday.", "description": "Amid the excitement of Serena Williams' latest bid for U.S. Open glory, some off-court news buzzed about the plaza at Flushing Meadows: a duchess had come to Queens.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427392847&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8610B", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
