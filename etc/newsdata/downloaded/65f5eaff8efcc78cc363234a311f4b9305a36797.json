(AP) - Maybe it was the injuries. Or the lightweight recruiting profile. Or maybe it was playing at one of the deepest positions at Notre Dame.\n\nWhatever the reason, Drew White is aware that earning the starting job at middle linebacker came as a surprise to some.\n\n\u201cI never really saw it that way,\u201d said White, who ranks third on the Fighting Irish this season with 21 tackles and leads the team with six tackles for loss. \u201cI don\u2019t really get it.\u201d\n\nWhite suffered a broken ankle as a sophomore in the spring of 2018 and then broke his shoulder this year during spring break in a \u201cfreak\u201d snow skiing accident that didn\u2019t sit well with his coaches.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with going on a family vacation, but you\u2019re also on a scholarship,\u201d coach Brian Kelly said. \u201cThe good part about it is it\u2019s behind us. He worked through it.\u201d\n\nWhite will make his fifth start of the season Saturday when No. 9 Notre Dame (3-1) plays at home against Bowling Green (1-3). It\u2019s been a halting climb for White, who was a two-year starter at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and led his state-championship team in tackles both of those seasons.\n\nStill, most recruiting services rated White as a three-star recruit at best. At 6 feet and 230 pounds, White doesn\u2019t appear to be a physically imposing figure in the middle of a defense where linebackers Te\u2019von Coney and Drue Tranquill so recently roamed. It all may help to explain why White remained an afterthought during his first two seasons at Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cHe is somewhat inconspicuous,\u201d said Aquinas head football coach Roger Harriott. \u201cSo you don\u2019t expect him to move that fast, or be as physical and as strong as he is.\u201d\n\nWhite let his game do the talking and earned the trust of his coaches last season in a fill-in starting role against Navy, the only extended action of his career before this season. With Tranquill out with an ankle injury, White was asked to help defend Navy\u2019s complex triple-option rushing attack. He responded with five tackles in a 44-22 Irish win.\n\n\u201cI already believed that I was ready to play at this level and I was just waiting for my shot,\u201d White said. \u201cBut definitely the Navy game gave me a boost of confidence and showed me that I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nAfter Tranquill returned, White played only four snaps the final five games of the season. He cemented his place as a starter this season in the opener against Louisville with five tackles, two tackles for loss and one sack.\n\nHe added four tackles against New Mexico and five more against Georgia before a career-best seven last Saturday in a 35-20 win against Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe needed that kind of production from the middle linebacker position,\u201d Kelly said in reference to replacing two of his top three tacklers from last season in Coney and Tranquill. \u201cSomebody was going to have to give it to us.\u201d\n\nWith two surgeries during his time at Notre Dame, limited offseason work the last two years and facing a group of top linebacker recruits to compete against in training camp, White\u2019s journey from scout team to starter seemed unlikely.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a winner,\u201d Irish defensive coordinator Clark Lea said of White\u2019s resiliency. \u201cHe\u2019s fought through adversity and hasn\u2019t wavered, hasn\u2019t backed down and has been counted out probably 100 times.\u201d\n\nAnd about that skiing?\n\n\u201cI will not be going skiing again until after I\u2019m done playing football,\u201d White joked.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Maybe it was the injuries.
