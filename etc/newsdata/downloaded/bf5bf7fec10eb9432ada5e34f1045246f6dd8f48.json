She and her fianc\u00e9, a Sudanese national, denied that an abortion had taken place.\n\n\"We're shocked by this verdict,\" her lawyer, Abdelmoula El Marouri, told the Reuters news agency, saying that all the medical and legal evidence should have led to an acquittal. He said he would appeal against the verdict.\n\nThe prosecutor in the case said the circumstances of the journalist's arrest had nothing to do with her work as a journalist, and that the clinic she had visited was under police surveillance on suspicion of carrying out illegal abortions.\n\nThe court sentenced her fianc\u00e9 to a year in prison and her doctor to two years. The doctor's assistant and a nurse at the clinic were also found guilty but were given suspended sentences.\n\nAhmed Benchemsi, regional director for Human Rights Watch, described the verdict as a \"black day for freedom in Morocco\", calling it \"a blatant injustice, a flagrant violation of human rights, and a frontal attack on individual freedoms.\"", "description": "Activists say the charges against Hajar Raissouni are part of a crackdown on critical reporters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B24B/production/_109034654_ee458cf8-49e7-4dcd-9a3c-40a3027e9db2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
