I hope they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nMs Widner is also on the board of the Australian Investment Council (formerly AVCAL) and was previously the general partner at US fund SeaPoint Ventures.\n\nShe said it was not good enough for funds to complain about women not applying for\n\nroles when their business models were based on their ability to find talent.\n\nWhile there had been progress in getting more women into junior positions in VC firms, Ms Widner believed it was beholden on limited partners (LPs) to actively demand greater diversity amongst the people making investment decisions in the near term.\n\n\u201cVC\u2019s existence is dependent upon LPs and they are not putting the pressure on firms to increase gender diversity,\u201d she said.\n\n\"The only real change will come about when the LPs, who fund the firms, make it clear that diversity at the partner level is one of the metrics they will use when assessing firms.\n\n\"If the LPs, specifically the large super funds, say it's going to be a criteria for us in five years, I'd bet the funds would then make it a priority, and we would see more females at senior partner levels.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Blunt instrument' needed\n\nLike Ms Widner, former Blue Sky venture capital boss and current head of Human VC Elaine Stead also believes super funds have a role to play.\n\nMs Stead said a \"blunt instrument\" was needed to accelerate the change.\n\nElaine Stead says superannuation funds should demand more diversity in VC investment teams because it leads to better outcomes. Louise Kennerley\n\n\"This could be LPs insisting on better diversity metrics of general partners before they will allocate capital,\" she said. \"Not simply because it makes them feel warm and fuzzy, but because the data says funds with better diversity at fund and portfolio company levels outperform as a category.\n\n\"How this is balanced with the delicate alchemy of personalities needed for a VC partnership to work is another question, although I note that partnerships in other industries seem to cope just fine.\"\n\nThe sector's biggest LP and funder of the venture capital industry, Hostplus, refused to comment.\n\nDr Stead and Ms Widner are two of a small handful of women who are investment partners at local funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther female investment partners include Blackbird Ventures' Sam Wong and OneVentures' Dr Michelle Deaker and Anne-Marie Birkell.\n\nAndrea Gardiner is also in the process of raising a VC fund for Jelix Ventures and Scale Investors chief executive Ariane Barker is raising capital for a female founders VC fund alongside Acorn Capital.\n\nFormer Reinventure investment partner Kara Frederick has also started her own fund, Tiger Financial.\n\nShe said while partners played important roles for non-investment VC, this did not correspond to more women having a say in what companies got backing.\n\nMs Frederick also believed that even with more women coming into funds at junior ranks or in operational roles, this would not necessarily lead to more diversity amongst the investment partners.\n\n\"We've seen in Silicon Valley that partners at VC funds stay forever ... Change is glacial,\" she said. \"There is more promise now than there has been before and we do need to give VCs credit for that fact ... But it's tough for anyone to break into senior investment roles.\"\n\nMs Frederick said it was unlikely super funds would demand an improvement in the diversity of partners at existing funds, but she believed there was an onus on them to back a wider array of managers, stretching beyond just gender.\n\n\"They need to back a variety of managers that look and think differently,\" she said.\n\n\"It's easier to back new managers than it is to try and alter the culture or fabric of an existing team.\n\n\"To achieve this it isn't just a tweak to a mandate. The onus is on the LPs to say where are the other perspectives from smart people we can back.\"", "description": "To accelerate change in investment circles in the VC sector, women are calling on the biggest financial backers to make diversity a priority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4234%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_267%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/823adc88fa7f73bb4a9ec9036c03b97f69b55716", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
