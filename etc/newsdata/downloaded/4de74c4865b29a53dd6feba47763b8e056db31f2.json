EA's offer is part of the company's campaign for the National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and the offer will stand for October 2019 only.\n\nHere are EA's conditions:\n\nCurrent Origin Access Basic members - if they turn on 2FA, they won't be charged next month, which is November 2019.\n\nCurrent Origin Access Premier members - same offer, but they'll get access to a free month of Premier access instead, also in November 2019.\n\nCurrent Origin Access Basic/Premier members - if they have 2FA already enabled, they will get a free month as well.\n\nThe offer ends October 31, 2019, EA said. Users who want to participate will have to have installed the company's Origin client on their computers. Instructions on how to enable the Login Verification feature are available on this EA support page.\n\nEA is not the only company to push for users to enable 2FA. Starting with February this year, Epic Games has been rewarding Fortnite players with a free game perk (a free character dance) if they enable 2FA for their accounts.\n\nOver the summer, Microsoft said that enabling a multi-factor authentication solution stops 99.9% of all account hacks.\n\nAlso as part of the October 2019 National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Google yesterday added a new tool to its service that can check user passwords for leaked credentials, and has also launched an incognito mode for the Google Maps mobile app.", "description": "Offer stands only for October 2019.
