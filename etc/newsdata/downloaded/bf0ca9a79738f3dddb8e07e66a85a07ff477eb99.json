The French author, now 51, who won the Goncourt for his first novel in 1996, initially only admitted responsibility for the drawings before acknowledging he had also written the texts.\n\n\u201cI wrote, I drew, I produced crap. These texts and these drawings are antisemitic, but I am not an antisemite,\u201d he told Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cToday, the man I am is ashamed. The whole journey I have made since then, my journey as a man, is the story of someone who has tried to escape this toxic geography, to extract myself from this trap.\u201d\n\nAfter the shortlist of 15 novels was announced earlier this week, president of the Goncourt Academy, Bernard Pivot, explained to RTL why Moix was not on it. The second part of the novel is notably worse than the first, he said, but the judges were also concerned that were they to shortlist it, \u201cinevitably, we will be accused across social media of promoting antisemitism via an antisemite\u201d.\n\nPivot said he was also disinclined to include the book because it has sparked a \u201cfamily controversy and the Academy doesn\u2019t like it when a book is challenged by the father and the brother\u201d. Moix\u2019s father has denied the physical abuse which Moix portrays in Orl\u00e9ans, and his brother Alexandre Moix has said the \u201cabuse and humiliations of a rare violence\u201d that Moix attributes in the novel to their parents was actually done by Moix to him.\n\nThe Goncourt president said that Moix had \u201ca great talent \u2026 but unfortunately he has an immoderate taste for controversy and provocation\u201d.\n\nMoix is known as a provocateur, earlier this year telling Marie-Claire magazine\u2019s French edition that he was incapable of loving a woman over 50. \u201cCome on now, let\u2019s not exaggerate! That\u2019s not possible \u2026 too, too old,\u201d he said in January.\n\nAccording to Alexandre Moix, writing in Le Parisen, \u201cin his life, my brother has only two obsessions: to win the Prix Goncourt and to annihilate me\u201d.", "description": "Yann Moix, 51, says he is ashamed of his student magazine work but judges of the prestigious Prix Goncourt feel he has courted too much controversy", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d32ee73a664ff9cc4696336811f20678a6f7290e/0_0_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=668f5b85c5a13606c2bf60d709e7ae44", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
