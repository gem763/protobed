The CCP drew the opposite lesson, becoming so fearful of popular political mobilization that it insisted that Hong Kong\u2019s laws be effectively unchanged from 1984, when the Sino-British Declaration on the city\u2019s handover was agreed, through to the official transfer in 1997, unless reforms were authorized by the Party itself. It even demanded that a labor law passed in early 1997 guaranteeing the rights of collective bargaining be scrapped, which it was soon after the handover.\n\nSince then, Beijing has sought to pass an antisedition law, attempted to promulgate \u201cpatriotic education\u201d in Hong Kong, and restricted the territory\u2019s ability to choose its chief executive. The heavy-handed, unyielding stance Beijing has taken against this summer\u2019s protests has only served to \u201cpour oil on the flames,\u201d as a Chinese proverb says, pushing Hong Kongers into a corner: They must fight for their freedom once more, or become slaves to Beijing\u2019s imperial rule.\n\nHow much can the ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong be compared to Tiananmen? On the protesters\u2019 side are plenty of similarities. For one thing, the \u201csilent majority\u201d of the population did not always remain passive or follow party orders in 1989. Ordinary Beijing residents were the ones who risked their lives to brave the fire as tanks and machine guns made their way to the square. Much of the same is happening in Hong Kong today: Students and young people have been at the forefront of the rallies, but a wide array of residents have joined them, including civil servants, accountants, medical personnel, the elderly, and others.\n\nRead: Lessons from Moscow: How China might handle Hong Kong\n\nYet the differences are also significant. The regime in Beijing has changed a lot in 30 years. The Chinese economy today is far larger, and Hong Kong\u2019s proportion of it substantially smaller. The tools available to the state are also much greater than they were in 1989, with a more powerful security apparatus and myriad economic levers at its disposal. At the same time, Hong Kong\u2019s institutional infrastructure is far more advanced than any other Chinese city in its ability to serve Beijing\u2019s global ambitions. Hong Kong still operates a U.S.-dollar-denominated currency market that is part of the global financial system, the only one in China, and is key to Beijing\u2019s many projects worldwide, not least the Belt and Road Initiative. So Beijing would be loath to go too far in eroding these institutions. Donald Trump has also linked the CCP\u2019s response to the protests to his ongoing trade war with China.\n\nBeijing has done well to grant Hong Kong\u2019s protesters some of what they want in withdrawing the extradition bill. Yet China must also investigate police abuse, give amnesty to arrested protesters, and reopen political reform toward comprehensive universal suffrage in the territory.\n\nOf course, it may not, reckoning it can wear down Hong Kong\u2019s protesters. Given the city\u2019s history and its rapidly politicized population, that would be a miscalculation.", "description": "When Chinese student protesters thronged Tiananmen Square in 1989, their comrades in Hong Kong stood with them.
