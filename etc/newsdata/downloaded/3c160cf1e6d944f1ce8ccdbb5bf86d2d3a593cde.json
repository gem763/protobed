(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nEver since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared an impeachment inquiry two weeks ago, she has said in interviews and elsewhere that calling for a floor vote in the U.S. House on the issue was not a Constitutional requirement.\n\nWhile she\u2019s technically correct, not calling for such a vote gives off the appearance of not having confidence that your caucus will carry through with their stated support of either an inquiry or impeachment itself. It\u2019s also an indicator Pelosi doesn\u2019t want to put some vulnerable House Democrats on the hot seat in a crucial election year.\n\nPlus, as a fired up Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) noted Tuesday, Pelosi\u2019s refusal to do so has hamstrung House Republicans and Trump\u2019s legal team:\n\n\u2026 because there has not been a vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, because the minority does not have any rights for subpoenas, because the president doesn\u2019t have the right to have council present to ask questions for subpoena power, to present evidence.\n\nEarlier today, House Democrat John Garamendi broke with fellow California Reps. (and impeachment circus ringleaders) Pelosi and Adam Schiff, telling CNN it\u2019s time to hold a vote on the issue:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to put a vote on the floor, a resolution for the inquiry structured in such a way that it can move forward with full power of the Congress behind it,\u201d Garamendi said in an interview on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat will further strengthen Congress\u2019s hand,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey want a fight, OK,\u201d Garamendi said of the White House. \u201cThen let us arm ourselves completely and totally with the full power of Congress.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Hill, Garamendi \u201cdoes not serve on any of the main committees leading the impeachment inquiry.\u201d But just in case you think Garamendi might be one of the more tame Democrats in the House, think again. In the same interview, he said those who do not cooperate with the House\u2019 investigation should be carted off to jail.\n\nGaramendi is not the only Democrat who came out today calling for a formal vote on the House floor for an impeachment inquiry. So did 2020 presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to question the speaker\u2019s wisdom and I\u2019m sure she has a very good reason for proceeding in the way that she has,\u201d the 2020 hopeful told MSNBC. \u201cBut to your question, I\u2019d love to remove that as a talking point or a reason for the kind of obstruction that you\u2019re seeing from the president.\u201d\n\n\n\nMSNBC host Hallie Jackson had asked O\u2019Rourke whether he thought House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., should act to take away the administration\u2019s legal argument for not cooperating with her inquiry.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a \u201ctalking point\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t expect him to characterize it any other way.\n\nPelosi should hold that vote on an impeachment inquiry. On one hand, not doing it protects vulnerable incumbents for the time being and gives Republicans and the White House few legal options.\n\nOn the other hand, the longer she refuses to, the more it adds credence to Republican and White House claims that this is all nothing but a giant sham a la the Russia collusion hoax.\n\nShe\u2019s apparently decided the risk that this will be viewed as a sham over the long term is worth the risk, which is one reason why Pence is traveling this week to key House districts \u2013 to remind voters that elections, not impeachment, are how we settle political differences.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
