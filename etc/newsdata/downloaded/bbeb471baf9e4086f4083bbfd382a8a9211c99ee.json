REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo cited the decision of the Commerce Department on Monday to add 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision (002415.SZ) - to a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The visa restrictions \u201ccomplement\u201d the Commerce Department actions, he said.\n\nU.S. officials previously said the Trump administration was considering sanctions against officials linked to China\u2019s crackdown on Muslims, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who, as a member of the powerful politburo, is in the upper echelons of China\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe State Department announcement did not name the officials subject to the visa restrictions, but news of the action sent U.S. stocks down. Many analysts believe U.S. government actions make it much less likely that China and the United States will reach a deal this week to resolve a trade war.\n\n\u201cThe United States calls on the People\u2019s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. China has consistently denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.\n\nRelated Coverage China condemns U.S. visa restrictions over treatment of Muslims\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton praised the State Department announcement and urged U.S. allies to follow suit. Chinese \u201cofficials who place Uighurs and other minority groups in concentration camps shouldn\u2019t be allowed to visit the United States and enjoy our freedoms.\u201d\n\nThose added by the Commerce Department to the \u201cEntity List\u201d include the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region People\u2019s Government Public Security Bureau, 19 subordinate government agencies and eight commercial firms, according to a Commerce Department filing.\n\nThe companies include some of China\u2019s leading artificial intelligence firms such as SenseTime Group Ltd, and Megvii Technology Ltd, which is backed by Alibaba (BABA.N), as well as Hikvision, formally known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ), IFLYTEK Co (002230.SZ), Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co (300188.SZ), and Yixin Science and Technology Co.", "description": "The United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Eric Beech", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438602785&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971W6", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
