He gained a reputation for never yielding to power, money or influence, and became perhaps the most revered figure of Mexico\u2019s present-day art world.\n\nHis paintings were a celebration of the mystical world, the animal spirits and color of the indigenous cultures in his native Oaxaca. He fought battles to save green spaces and historic buildings, to make art accessible to the public and to oppose McDonalds\u2019 plans to open an outlet in his beloved Oaxaca city, considered the heartland of Mexican cuisine.\n\nThe cause of his death and final funeral plans had yet to be announced.\n\nPeople erected impromptu traditional offerings of flowers and candles in his memory in Oaxaca and Mexico City.\n\nA simple wooden table in Oaxaca City\u2019s Institute of Graphic Arts, which Toledo founded, held a photo of the wild-haired, bearded painter. Around it, on the ground, were bunches of flowers and candles.\n\n\u201cThe streets smell of Toledo, the streets are Toledo,\u201d said Yesica S\u00e1nchez Maya, one of the mourners. \u201cWe see Toledo as the personification of dignity in the flesh and solidarity with everyone.\u201d\n\nWriter and environmentalist Homero Aridjis wrote, \u201cWe have lost one of the great ones.\u201d\n\nThe artist\u2019s family confirmed his death on his Facebook page, but gave no further details.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador wrote in his Twitter account that \u201cart is mourning.\u201d He called Toledo \u201can authentic defender of nature, customs and traditions of our people.\u201d\n\nAlberto Soto Cort\u00e9s, an art professor at Mexico\u2019s IberoAmerican University, wrote that \u201cmany of the politicians and business interests that mourn Toledo\u2019s passing were the very ones he combatted.\u201d\n\nIndeed, even though L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s 2018 election won almost unanimous praise across the left, Toledo still publicly opposed the president\u2019s plan to build a tourist train line through the jungles of the Yucatan peninsula. Toledo, along with others, argued that the environmental impact hadn\u2019t been studied enough and that the Maya indigenous communities hadn\u2019t been fully consulted.\n\nTime and time again, when a green space or historic building in Oaxaca was threatened, Toledo was there, demonstrating in the street to save it.\n\nHe played a large role in creating botanical gardens at the former Santo Domingo convent in Oaxaca, and he founded art galleries and art centers in historic buildings at several sites.\n\n\u201cThough there will be many homages and the price of his works will go up, it is unlikely that the institutions, corporations and politicians will stop to reflect on the causes and demands that Francisco Toledo championed in life,\u201d wrote Soto Cort\u00e9s.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mexicans left candles and flowers at impromptu offerings Friday for expressionist painter Francisco Toledo a day after his death at age 79, remembering an artist respected for his fights to preserve historic sites and green spaces.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/mexico_toledo_obit_35952_c0-111-2000-1277_s1770x1032.jpg?f482c48a3f69c7e3aae4bc2075ae28deac08418c", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
