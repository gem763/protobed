They told her she must go with; there is another child waiting for her and that they have cupcakes for her,\" she said in a video recording shared on social media platforms.\n\n\"I always thought that this can't happen to me or my children because I am very vigilant, very cautious when it comes to my kids. But it happened so quickly. These people pretended to be from Belgravia Road [in Athlone], trying to make an honest living selling cupcakes.\"\n\nClassens said she was further disappointed by the reaction she received when she went to the Maneneberg police station to report what had happened.\n\n\"I just expected more from them. The way they treated me\u2026 I was crying at the police station and the fact that they blatantly just ignored me was very heartbreaking.\"\n\nWestern Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andr\u00e8 Traut said the matter had been reported to Manenberg police station management and was being investigated internally.\n\n\"Once the mother's statement has been obtained, the circumstances surrounding the incident will also be investigated criminally,\" he said.\n\nClassens urged parents to be careful.\n\n\"Just be cautious. Speak to your children not to go to strangers, not to be lured by the fact that it's cupcakes or sweets or whatever form of luxury [they are being coaxed with].\"", "description": "A Cape Town mother claims two women selling cupcakes door-to-door attempted to kidnap her two-year-old daughter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7447/6478b384d28f4fed9282e68a8a0d6f2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
