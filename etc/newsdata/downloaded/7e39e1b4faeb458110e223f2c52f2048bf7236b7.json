Get Me Out of Here! according to reports.\n\nThe Irish singer, 34, would be a fascinating watch as she could reveal secrets about the band's acrimonious split and her feud with Cheryl.\n\nShe is the latest star tipped to enter the celebrity jungle, which will be back on our screens next month.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA source told The Sun: \u201cNadine is a big name and ITV was keen to get her.\n\n\"Her link to Cheryl makes her an even more exciting prospect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret there\u2019s no love lost between them, and Nadine is refreshingly honest about what went on from her perspective.\n\n\"And I\u2019m a Celebrity could well be the start of something big again for her.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nShe recently claimed the girl band, which won Pop Stars: The Rivals in 2002, never got on as friends to begin with, and are no longer in touch.\n\nAppearing on Celebrity Juice, she said: \"There was no fallout, no. There was just no friendship to begin with.\n\n\"It\u2019s for the best.\"\n\nNadine has previously revealed that no-one liked her because she was given more lines to sing.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"It was fine at the start but there\u2019s always politics in any band. It just happened that I always got more vocals than everybody else, so in terms of people wanting their voice heard, that wasn't happening,\" she told The Sun.\n\n\"It made people, very bitter. They didn\u2019t like that.\n\n|It\u2019s so sad for me to have to admit this stuff now because for so long, there\u2019s the band, and you want everybody to think we\u2019re best friends and we have pillow fights and, you know, drink milkshakes.\n\n(Image: AKM-GSI / Barcroft)\n\n\"That\u2019s what I wanted it to be. I really, really wanted that to be, but it just wasn\u2019t how it was. We\u2019re all very, very different characters.\"\n\nLove could even be on the cards for Nadine when she enters the jungle, as she recently split from her boyfriend of 11 years, footballer Jason Bell.\n\nAlso rumoured to be going in are Maura Higgins, Jamie Laing, Jennifer Metcalfe, Richard Madeley, Summer Monteys Fullam, and Stacey Dooley.", "description": "Nadine Coyle will reportedly be heading into the celebrity jungle as she becomes the latest famous face rumoured to be signed", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Pa", "Daily Record", "Akm-Gsi", "Barcroft"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20502981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BUILD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
