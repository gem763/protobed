However, protests continued around the country. A 24-hour pause in the vote count earlier this week sparked allegations of tampering, which have brought tens of thousands of opposition activists into the streets to contest the outcome, at times clashing with police.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bolivia\u2019s Morales celebrates election win amid opposition claims of fraud & ongoing mass demonstrations\n\nMorales avoided a second-round runoff with his rival Carlos Mesa by just a fraction of a point and denies the accusations of fraud. He said on Friday that international auditors would be free to inspect the final tally and the vote counting process.\n\n\u201cLet them come here, let them know how much they have earned [...] We never lie or hide,\u201d he said, but added elsewhere that the world community had \u201cthe obligation to respect our Political Constitution of State, they have to respect the will of the Bolivian people.\u201d\n\nThe remarks were directed at the Organization of American States (OAS) \u2013 based in Washington, DC \u2013 which previously expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d and \u201csurprise\u201d over the delayed vote tally. More recently, OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro argued the election result should not be considered valid until an audit is complete.\n\nIn a joint statement issued on Thursday, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and the United States (all OAS members) called for a second round of voting in the event a proper audit could not be carried out.\n\nMesa, a former president and Morales\u2019s main challenger, said on Friday that he would lodge a formal complaint with the Supreme Election Tribunal over the result, which he condemned as a \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d He has encouraged his supporters to reject the outcome as well.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bolivia opposition candidate contests election count as rival protesters & police clash in streets (VIDEOS)\n\nOpposition protesters have barricaded roadways across six of Bolivia\u2019s nine provinces, with clashes between rival demonstrators and police breaking out in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, where at least 25 were arrested on Friday. Thousands also gathered around a vote counting station in La Paz late on Thursday, for protests and street skirmishes. The president has slammed the demonstrations as an attempted coup.\n\nCompared to its neighbors Chile and Ecuador \u2013 both currently gripped by protests over economic woes \u2013 as well as its ally Venezuela, Bolivia has seen relative success under its mixed socialist system, with its economy steadily growing at just under four percent annually in recent years. The government has also kept inflation relatively low, perhaps learning from Venezuela\u2019s example, and made efforts to slash public debt.\n\nLike this story?
