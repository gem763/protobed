Self-evidently, situational awareness and emotional intelligence are not resources Milne possesses surfeit resources of. Neither have his fellow directors displayed the presence of mind to tap him on the shoulder.\n\nThen there\u2019s Dwyer, whose biography disingenuously introduces her as \u201cchairman and non-executive director of Tabcorp since June 2011.\u201d While Dwyer became chairman of Tabcorp upon the demerger of Echo Entertainment (now Star), when her predecessor John Story switched to chair the casino business, she had actually been a Tabcorp director since August 2005. Er, you don\u2019t get to reset your tenure every time the company flogs a division. That is totally not a thing! Cynically, Tabcorp started presenting directors\u2019 service this way only in 2016, five years after the fact.\n\nAfter 14 years, not eight, Dwyer wants another two and, ironically, her board\u2019s abysmal succession planning is her very selling point. She\u2019s it! In an industry where directors\u2019 regulatory clearance can take a year or longer, Tabcorp\u2019s leadership cupboard is otherwise bare \u2013 though you certainly wouldn\u2019t recognise that manifest reality in the annual report\u2019s fetching Board Skills Matrix, in which the directors, exuding typical acumen dysmorphia, self-assess both their technical skills and experience to be commendably 8 out of 10, except in the non-core disciplines of \u201cgambling industry experience\u201d and \u201cinformation technology\u201d. And Milne\u2019s people skills?\n\nMoney-laundering breaches\n\nOtherwise, wouldn\u2019t institutional shareholders be demanding some accountability for Tabcorp\u2019s 236 breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws (AUSTRAC fined it $45 million in 2017) and the $200 million it dusted on the disastrous Sun Bets joint venture with News UK?\n\nOr even just adequate oversight of executive management? In a year where the wagering business was again the key drag on group performance (with its full-year earnings falling $26 million short of consensus and 2H earnings down 22 per cent before Tatts synergies thanks to poor execution and cost control), the board granted its managing director Adam Rytenskild 80 per cent of his short term incentives. It used its discretion to pay outgoing CFO Damien Johnson 85 per cent of his, and all of it in cash. And this is after a first strike at last year\u2019s AGM! Does chief executive David Attenborough play old Beth Rowley records on supersonic frequency through the night at board retreats?! You got me wrapped around your little finger\u2026\n\nDwyer earns $530,350 a year as autopilot ... sorry, chairman, and Milne is paid $208,050. Dwyer attended 24 board and committee meetings in FY19. Milne attended 15.\n\nSick of deaf ears and empty assurances, major shareholders \u2013 including Investors Mutual (just below 5 per cent of the register) and the mighty AustralianSuper (6.6 per cent) are starting to bang their cutlery on the table. Just 16 more sleeps \u2026", "description": "After 14 years, Dwyer wants another two, and ironically, her board\u2019s abysmal succession planning is her very selling point.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_464%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/81f4fc52e063ef4fee6966b81a016d945daa190c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
