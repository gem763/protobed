But they didn\u2019t listen,\u201d says Adah, who now lives in Mill Hill with her daughter, 12, and one-year-old son.\n\n\u201cThey just said I couldn\u2019t have an appointment. So if I had a problem, I started looking up how I could help myself. I would google treatments.\u201d\n\nAnah, who suffers with severe depression and borderline personality disorder, was meanwhile experiencing acute side effects as a result of not being able to get her medication.\n\n\u201cWhen I got really sick it was very bad. I was vomiting; I was shaking; I was sweating. It was like coming off methadone or something,\u201d she remembers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They said no because you\u2019re not registered here, you\u2019re registered somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThey said I had been taken off their system and registered somewhere else: where Adah lives.\u201d\n\nThe women sometimes managed to find ways around it. Adah would go to a walk-in clinic, but this meant long waits. Anah resorted to re-registering with the GP each time she needed an appointment \u2013 a cumbersome task that still left her without medication for days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to fill in the form and give it to them, and then I\u2019d have to wait 48 hours until I could see a doctor or a nurse. That happened more than six times when I desperately needed it,\u201d says Anah.\n\n\u201cIt had a big impact on me. It\u2019s been very stressful. Sometimes I\u2019d think am I going crazy? Is it just me? I\u2019d start doubting myself. It would mess everything up in my head.\u201d\n\nThings got worse when NHS staff reportedly started issuing them each other\u2019s medication.\n\nAdah says she was told to go on anti-depressants that had been prescribed to her sister. She refused, which in turn led to medical professionals assuming that she was failing to heed their advice.\n\n\u201cThey were always questioning why I wasn\u2019t on my medication. When I was pregnant in hospital, they were asking me why I came off my medication,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being questioned all the time. The way they look at you. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\n\nAnah says letters meant for her regarding therapy appointments were sent to Adah instead, which led to authorities to penalise her for missing them.\n\n\u201cI was treated like it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she says.\n\nThey tried to resolve the issue. Adah says she spent hours trying to call numerous NHS helplines.\n\n\u201cAll they would say is: \u2018I can see the problem Ms Bermudez, but it\u2019s private and confidential\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of the phone calls weren\u2019t free, so my bill was really high. I tried and tried but then gave up. I just didn\u2019t bother going to the doctor anymore.\u201d\n\nAnd the problem continues to haunt the Bermudez twins today.\n\nLast month, Adah phone the NHS 111 helpline due to bleeding following her baby\u2019s birth, and was told they held no record of her on the system, but two for her sister.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a mess-up somewhere. People don\u2019t realise how much your identity in the database affects you. It\u2019s completely broken me down.\u201d\n\nAnah is still suffering from the effects of routinely not receiving her medication when she needed it. She blames the mix-up for her poor mental health today, which she says often leaves her unable to leave the house.\n\n\u201cIf I was given the right treatment and medication I don\u2019t think I would be this sick today,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t such a mix-up, I think I would\u2019ve realised that I really do have a problem, I would have got the help that I needed, and realised that I really do need to deal with it properly. I can\u2019t believe how the system has failed.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by The Independent, a spokesperson for NHS Digital said they could not talk about individual cases, but said that \u201cfrom time to time errors unfortunately occur\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are most likely to happen where two patients have the same or very similar demographic information, particularly surname, date of birth and address,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWhen a problem with patient records is reported to us, normally by a GP practice or other care provider organisation, a dedicated team investigates promptly to identify and rectify any issues with the records on the national systems for which we are responsible.\n\n\u201cWe also work with other NHS organisations to notify them of actions we have taken so that they can check and correct their own records.\u201d", "description": "Ten years ago, identical twins Adah and Anah Bermudez were both in dire need of medical help \u2013 but neither could get a doctor to see them.
