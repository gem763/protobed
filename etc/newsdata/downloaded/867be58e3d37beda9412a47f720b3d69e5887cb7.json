And obviously you've gotta be more careful, you've only got one brain, so I'm just trying to be as smart as I can with it.\"\n\nBichette was hit by a pitch from Gabriel Ynoa in the top of the sixth inning but initially stayed in the game after being assessed on the field by trainers. He made a defensive play on a ground ball in the bottom of the sixth and batted again in the top of the seventh before being replaced by Richard Urena for the bottom of the inning.\n\nIn MLB concussion protocol\n\nBichette said the symptoms didn't appear right away, but he started to feel \"a little bit off\" as the game went on. He credited veteran Justin Smoak with convincing him to tell the training staff about his symptoms.\n\n\"When I went out to my at bat [in the seventh inning] I felt really weird in the box, so I came back in and actually Smoaky came up to me and said, 'Hey bro, are you alright?' I was like 'I don't know, man, I feel weird.' And he told me 'Hey, this is nothing to play around with,\"' Bichette said. \"So that's when I decided I should probably let somebody know I felt different.\"\n\nBichette was put in MLB concussion protocol Thursday and was re-evaluated in New York on Friday.\n\nHe did not play Friday night in the opener of a three-game series against the Yankees.\n\nToronto manager Charlie Montoyo said before Friday's game that Bichette would likely miss the entirety of the series.\n\nBichette is batting .311 with 11 homers and 21 runs batted in through 46 games.", "description": "Blue Jays rookie Bo Bichette says he's feeling better but trying to \"be smart\" about his recovery from a head injury.
