Thankfully, the police showed up.\u201d\n\nMr. Herbert claims the child was \u201cbeing harassed and bullied by the caretakers, that\u2019s what makes this case overly egregious, and that\u2019s why we filed suit for this young child.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother, Yvonne Pinkston, claimed teachers had not done enough to prevent her son from being bullied and \u201ceven became abusive towards him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything could have happened to my son out there,\u201d Ms. Pinkston said. \u201cAnything. In that neighborhood? Anything could have happened.\u201d\n\nMr. Herbert also claimed the school lied about the boy\u2019s exit, claiming in a Chicago Police Department document that he \u201cwalked out of school and needs a report\u201d after they called 911 to report the missing child.\n\n\u201cThey said that this kid ran out of the school. He was thrown out of the school,\u201d Mr. Herbert said.\n\nA Chicago Schools spokesperson said the security guard was \u201cremoved from his position\u201d and the principal is being investigated.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are deeply disturbing, and we are fully committed to holding accountable any adult whose actions could have endangered a student,\u201d they said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
