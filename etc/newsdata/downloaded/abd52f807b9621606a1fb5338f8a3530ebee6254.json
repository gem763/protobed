On the night of the 27th, Kim announced that the album would arrive two days later. It did not materialize.\n\nOver the weekend last month when it was expected to drop, West held Sunday Service events, hosted listening parties for the album, and unveiled an accompanying documentary film that\u2019s now showing in IMAX theaters. Earlier this week, he announced that Jesus Is King would arrive at midnight on October 25. After midnight came and went, he tweeted that he was finalizing mixes for three tracks. West did, however, make a surprise appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nYesterday (October 24), West joined Zane Lowe for a two-hour interview. At one point in the conversation, he announced that he\u2019s releasing a new album on Christmas Day called Jesus Is Born.\n\nAt several points on the album, Kanye references the 13th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which established the abolition of slavery. The text of the 13th Amendment reads: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d On the song \u201cOn God,\u201d Kanye raps, \u201c13th Amendment, gotta end it, that\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nDuring his meeting with Donald Trump in the White House last year, Kanye talked about his problem with the 13th Amendment at length: \u201cYou know, so the four\u2014the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn\u2019t look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read\u2014or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave.\u201d Some have inferred that he\u2019s specifically referring to the exception clause of the amendment.\n\nPrior to the extensive teasing of Jesus Is King, Kanye West announced last year that his next album would be titled Yandhi. The project was originally slated for a release date of September 29, 2018\u2014the same night as his infamous Saturday Night Live appearance. The album did not arrive on that date, and was subsequently delayed, and then postponed indefinitely. It\u2019s unclear if or when that album will arrive.\n\nWest\u2019s last album ye arrived in 2018 during a summer when he also produced albums for PUSHA-T, Nas, and Teyana Taylor. He also released Kids See Ghosts, his joint LP with Kid Cudi.\n\nRead Pitchfork\u2019s report from Kanye\u2019s Jesus Is King event in New York and his event in Los Angeles.", "description": "After a series of Sunday Services, listening parties, and delays, the ye follow-up has finally arrived", "authors": ["Madison Bloom", "Evan Minsker"], "top_image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db24ba6fd8a1f0009ad5996/2:1/w_790/Kanye-West.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
