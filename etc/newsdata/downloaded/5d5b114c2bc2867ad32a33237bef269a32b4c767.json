This year we have seen school climate strikes, stark warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and alarming reports about melting ice sheets in Greenland,\u201d said Professor Burns.\n\n\u201cThe UK and EU should be working together to meet the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement and set out roadmaps to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across the continent by 2050. But Brexit has created uncertainty and raised the risk that the climate crisis will be pushed off the political agenda at this critical moment.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Green parties also made significant gains at the European elections at the end of May.\n\nIn June Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic blocked an EU climate change target of reaching net zero by 2050 by refusing to support it. Both Hungary and Poland have right-wing populist governments, while the Czech republic is led by a populist liberal-conservative outfit.\n\nEnvironmental groups reacted angrily to the news, and called on EU leaders to hold an emergency summit to agree the policy ahead of a key UN climate change meeting in the autumn.\n\n\u201cHollow words can\u2019t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who\u2019s lost their harvest to drought,\u201d Greenpeace EU climate policy adviser Sebastian Mang said at the time.", "description": "Weakened relations between the UK and EU as a result of Brexit could hinder co-operation on tackling the climate crisis, scientists have warned.\u00a0 The UK has been a key player in securing strong EU climate regulations but Brexit could give climate denying governments in central and eastern Europe more prominence and power to block environmental regulations, researchers from the", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2012/10/12/19/eu%20parliament.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
