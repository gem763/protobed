Five of the six crew members who happened to be awake when the fire began escaped by jumping into an inflatable boat they then steered to a nearby vessel. The end of the search means the Coast Guard has presumed all 33 passengers and the one additional crew member died after the blaze.\n\nAmong those is thought to be Kristy Finstad, 41, who was on the boat to assist her family-owned scuba diving company as it embarked on a multi-day expedition, the Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday. It is believed she was sleeping when the fire began at about 3.15am, officials said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The vessel was on the final day of a Labour Day weekend cruise when the fire erupted and a mayday call was made.\n\nThe boat sank to the bottom of the ocean floor nearly four hours after the fire began, with several victims still remaining underneath the wreckage, officials said. They were reportedly unable to retrieve all of the bodies under the boat due to weather conditions and other concerns.\n\n\"It is never an easy decision to suspend search efforts,\" Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester said at a news conference. \"We know that this is a very difficult time for families and friends of the victims.\"\n\n\u201cThis is probably the worst-case scenario you could possibly have,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said in a statement. \u201cYou have a vessel that\u2019s on the open sea, that is in the middle of the night. Fire is the scourge of any ship.\u201d\n\nCoast Guard records show inspections of the Conception conducted last February and in August 2018 found no deficiencies.\n\nEarlier inspections found some safety violations related to fire safety.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
