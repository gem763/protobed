He was severely wounded in a bomb explosion in Afghanistan, losing both legs above the knee and suffering serious injuries to his right forearm and both wrists. He is now a Fox News contributor.\n\nI remember exactly where I was, what I was doing and what went through my mind on Sept. 11, 2001 when I learned of the terrorist attacks on our country \u2013 just as millions of other Americans remember.\n\nWhat I remember most is that the horror of it all \u2013 nearly 3,000 people killed \u2013 didn't register, just didn\u2019t sink in until later that week.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve played football or other sports, you know that you eat, sleep and breathe it. I remember lying on my back in the Georgia heat sweating in my pads during high school football practice, looking up at the sky and seeing no planes flying, no exhaust trails.\n\nNEW YORK GOV. CUOMO SIGNS 9/11-RELATED BILL REQUIRING PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO HOLD MOMENT OF SILENCE\n\nI remember thinking that after this one terrible event, football didn't inspire, it didn't motivate, it just didn't mean as much to me.\n\nI realized in that moment that there were people working, training and fighting for something more than points on a scoreboard. They were fighting to preserve America\u2019s freedom and our way of life. They were fighting for me, for my family, for my friends \u2013 for everyone in our country.\n\nSo for this high school sophomore, 9/11 gave me a reason and a purpose for my life. In the dust and rubble of this enormous tragedy came a uniting spirit of survival that spread across America \u2013 unparalleled in history since Pearl Harbor in my grandparents\u2019 generation.\n\nThe Sept. 11 attacks were more than an act of war. They were an awakening for the entire free world.\n\nWe understand that some things are worth fighting for, including the amazing life America provides. We care, we believe and we act.\n\nWith a broken heart and a resilient spirit, America took the fight to an evil enemy. We showed the world that our nation was capable of righteous retaliation and that we were willing to fight for America\u2019s freedom and to defend our nation.\n\nWe banded together and we found patriotism where it had been forgotten. We found pride in ourselves and our differences \u2013 understanding that our diversity is our strength \u2013 where perhaps ignorance and fear had lived for too long.\n\nA small-town boy from Georgia, I raised my right hand and proudly joined the Marines, where I learned to love Americans of all races, religions and upbringings. Whether we were Republicans or Democrats, from big cities or small towns, from different regions, different races, rich or poor \u2013 none of it mattered. We were all simply and righteously Americans.\n\nThe people of the United States were truly united \u2013 and none more so than those of us who volunteered to serve in uniform in defense of the country we love.\n\nSadly, we've lost that unity in recent years, too often focusing on what divides us rather than the many things that unite us. But the flame of unity and patriotism still smolders and remains a beacon of hope. And I don\u2019t believe that only tragedy can cause the flame to burn brightly once again and spark a burning desire to love and serve.\n\nThat's why honoring and remembering those who perished on Sept. 11 has to be our purpose, our mission. To rub the sticks together and keep that flame of unity burning in all of us to honor and appreciate this entire country and what it stands for, and most importantly those men and women who fight to protect and keep it that way.\n\nHonoring and remembering the sad day of Sept. 11, 2001 and all those who lost their lives has to be our purpose, our mission. By doing this we honor and appreciate our country and what it stands for \u2013 and most importantly, those brave patriots who have fought to protect us and keep us free.\n\nWe think back to the planes crashing into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. We think back to the lives lost in combat.\n\nBut I'm a firm believer that life is for the living, and what's most important is that as we remember and honor all who lost their lives, we remember that we are survivors. We keep that unifying flame burning, lighting the torch of liberty, heirs to all the patriots who came before us, preserving the American Dream and making it come alive.\n\nWe understand that some things are worth fighting for, including the amazing life America provides. We care, we believe and we act.\n\nWhen I remember 9/11 and the life-changing injuries I suffered as a Marine in Afghanistan, I tell myself one thing: \"Get up, get over it and get going.\u201d I know we all get knocked down, but I\u2019ve made a choice to be one of those who come back stronger and more determined than ever. Just as this resilient country has.\n\nWhen history writes the story of my generation that came of age in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, I believe it will be a success story. A story of victory in the face of certain and evil adversity. Like every generation, we have been tested by hardship and tragedy. And we have triumphed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn the 18th anniversary of 9/11 we turn a special page \u2013 from a generation that experienced what was an unimaginable tragedy to a generation born from its ashes.

From the rubble of defeat, 9/11 is now a coming-of-age story for the next generation of the leaders, doers, and change agents we need to ensure that America and America\u2019s ideals will endure for all time.\n\nAs a combat veteran of both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the years following the Sept. 11 attacks, I\u2019m proud to pass this torch to the post-9/11 generation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPerhaps for the first time since that solemn moment when the Twin Towers fell we can call this day a celebration \u2013 a celebration of the resilience and ideals of \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d we honor with the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAmerica is a country worth fighting for, so we fought an enemy abroad. Let\u2019s hope that in the years ahead we spend less time fighting with each other, and more time embracing the greatest country on Earth. Let\u2019s be Americans first, and stand by each other with pride, patriotism and love.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JOHNNY \u201cJOEY\u201d JONES", "description": "On the 18th anniversary of 9/11 we turn a special page \u2013 from a generation that experienced what was an unimaginable tragedy to a generation born from its ashes.", "authors": ["Johnny", "Joey", "Staff Sergeant Johnny", "Jones", "Ret.", "Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In July"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/07/18/694940094001_6060965999001_6060959269001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
