No matter what.\n\nThe problem? While even the least impressive of the men and women likely to vie for the nomination back then were infinitely preferable to Donald Trump, few were terribly inspiring. Some were born in the first half of the last century; others were finger-wagging scolds; one was the mayor of New York.\n\nThen, earlier this year, a funny thing happened. And by funny I mean wonderful.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn mid-April, the mayor of a small Indiana city tossed his hat in the ring. A millennial, a veteran, and a well-read, thoughtful man of faith, he had a goofy grin, a hard-to-pronounce last name and, by all accounts, a charming husband.\n\nAs it happened, I already knew a bit about Pete Buttigieg. My wife heads a nonprofit that helps cities engage citizens in solving local problems. She has met countless mayors, and admires the traits shared by the best of them: common sense; a collaborative spirit; grit.\n\nBut Mayor Pete stood out. Mayor Pete, she said, should run for president.\n\nI was skeptical. A nation that installed a septuagenarian draft-dodger in the Oval Office was unlikely to turn around and elect a married gay man in his 30s as president, no matter how accomplished he might be. Right?\n\nStill, I paid attention.\n\nI heard Buttigieg speak from the heart about his decision to come out during his 2015 re-election bid \u2014 a contest he won in a landslide.\n\nI studied how he handled the 2012 firing of South Bend's first African American police chief (poorly) and how he handled the firing's divisive fallout (admirably).\n\nThis summer, after a white South Bend police officer shot and killed a 54-year-old black man named Eric Logan, I watched as Buttigieg once again wrestled \u2014 openly, awkwardly \u2014 with his city's enduring racial ills and with America's centuries-old legacy of white-on-black violence. (Eric Logan's family filed a federal lawsuit against the officer, Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, and South Bend in June. O'Neill resigned from the force in July.)\n\nI\u2019ve watched, too, as Buttigieg has struggled to gain traction with black voters. One painful reason for this must surely be that socially conservative, churchgoing African Americans are less likely than other Americans to embrace same-sex marriage, or LGBTQ civil rights in general. And this resistance from a traditional, core Democratic constituency might doom Mayor Pete\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBut Buttigieg, to his credit, is no quitter \u2014 and that, too, says something about him, and where he\u2019s from. A stable, post-Cold War, Midwestern childhood shaped him. Military service taught him that trusting men and women of diverse backgrounds and faiths, and proving trustworthy himself, could literally keep him alive. Coming out to friends, family, and political foes freed him.\n\nAll of this has, evidently, helped forge that rare political animal: a man unafraid.\n\nFew will argue that Pete Buttigieg is uniquely suited to this charged political moment. After all, seen through a particular lens, he is another white man vying for power. His detractors, meanwhile, dismiss his defining characteristic \u2014 a lifelong curiosity \u2014 as quaint, at best. (The New York Times derided Buttigieg\u2019s \"meaningless erudition\" as \"internetty smarts\" \u2014 a phrase that, let\u2019s face it, could only have been coined by someone with a terminal case of internetty smarts.)\n\nThen there is his brief stint with McKinsey & Company, the consulting colossus implicated in heinous behavior around the globe. Little indicates that Buttigieg embraces the most mercenary of McKinsey's values \u2014 but his work there has certainly spooked some on the left.\n\nIn the end, Buttigieg takes heat from all sides: he's not gay enough (whatever that means); or he\u2019s too gay (whatever that means); he's too centrist; too neoliberal; too wonky; too white.\n\nBut here's the rub: For more than two years, Donald Trump and his minions have undermined America\u2019s national security; rewarded mega-polluters, predatory lenders, and other corporate thugs; emboldened white supremacists and home-grown terrorists; and demonized the weakest among us. Any 2020 Democratic contender \u2014 Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, even addled, handsy Joe Biden \u2014 would make for a more competent, more legitimate leader.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
