The franchise was valued at $4.1 billion by Forbes magazine with revenue of $600 million; Brady sold the most officially licensed NFL player products and merchandise from March 1, 2018, through February 28, 2019, according to the NFL Players Association; and the team overall is second in the NFL in jersey sales.\n\n\u201cWhen you look back at the business that the Kraft family has built -- both on and off the field -- there\u2019s been some hiccups along the way, and part of the hiccups are the way they\u2019ve reacted and not let them linger,\u201d said Joe Favorito, a veteran sports media consultant and Columbia University professor.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Brown, he said, is unlikely to diminish the Patriots brand.\n\n\"These are kind of blips along the way, which happen with almost every pro team,\" he said. \"The brand still withstands the test of time.\u201d\n\nOne franchise that tops the Pats in value, revenue and merchandise sales is the Dallas Cowboys, known as America\u2019s Team. Forbes valued Jerry Jones\u2019 team at $5.5 billion with $950 million in revenue.\n\nDallas\u2019 brand is still strong from its 1970s and 90s dynasties when it won a record five Super Bowls, but it's had its own share of issues.\n\nThe team has overcome them in part because of the \"constant forward thinking of (owner) Jerry Jones and (his son, CEO) Stephen Jones,\" Favorito said. \"They have tremendous alumni, who are great brand ambassadors for them, and like the Yankees, there are certain keystone brands when you go around the world and you say the name, they still stand up. They\u2019re constantly in the mix and their brand speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nBoth the Cowboys and the Patriots provoke passion, and the New England team has become a target \"\"because of who they are and what they\u2019ve built,\" Favorito said. \"Like the Cowboys, either you love them or you hate them. I think there are probably teams that do things that fly below the radar that don\u2019t get noticed because they\u2019re not the elite brand.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Patriots took a hit for the Antonio Brown saga, but no it's no match for their brand.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19258605069991.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
