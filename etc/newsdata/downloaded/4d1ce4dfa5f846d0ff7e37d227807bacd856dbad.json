The Sergeant-at-Arms and other officers asked Republicans to remove their phones from the room and they refused.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Gaetz - a loyal Trump supporter - was asked to leave another committee hearing that he wasn\u2019t a member of after he tried to gatecrash it.\n\nWith their protest, Republicans have pivoted from challenging the substance of the testimonies, which have become increasingly damaging to the president, and are now attacking the process itself \u2014 despite the fact that Republicans also sit on impeachment committees and receive the same information and have the ability to question witnesses as their Democratic peers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defence, arrives at the US Capitol to give evidence to the impeachment hearings (Getty Images) More\n\nRepublicans say they are protesting what they describe as secretive proceedings and are demanding transcripts of witness testimony, despite the sensitivity of the flow of information that's intended to prevent compromising leaks.\n\nMr Trump was aware that the group of Republicans had planned to crash testimony and hoped that the stunt would speed the release of those transcripts, which he apparently believes would exonerate him, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAfter the Republicans' stunt, Mr Trump complained on Twitter that Democrats \u201callow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency\u201d.\n\nProceedings with Pentagon official Laura Cooper, who oversees US policy in Ukraine, were put on hold until later this afternoon.\n\nThe chaos came a day after crucial testimony from Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, whose damning statement to Congress explicitly linked Mr Trump's request for information into former vice president and political rival Joe Biden to military aid to the country, contrary to Mr Trump's denial of the so-called \"quid pro quo\" arrangement captured on a July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "description": "Impeachment hearings into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power were brought to a sensational halt after a group of more than 30 Republicans brought chaos to Wednesday's proceedings.After crashing a witness testimony in a closed-door hearing, Republicans lashed out at committee leaders behind the", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L0BDSJEIK7lbz.iWnYvzqg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3d56ef3adeac65a66309f6dc94e09295", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
