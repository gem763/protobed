Jonathan Burton8BIM (File)\n\nWard councillors\u2019 assistants want Msunduzi to pay them for overtime worked since 2016 and to stop the \u201cillegal\u201d deductions on their salaries.\n\nThe municipality has 40 assistants who alternate between working directly in the wards they are assigned to and at the Publicity House building, next to the City Hall.\n\nThey were appointed after the 2016 local government elections to assist ward councillors in their communities.\n\nThe assistants claim they were undermined by the office of the speaker, Jabu Ngubo.\n\nThey said they had to buy their own computers and printers as Msunduzi wanted all the information supplied to it to be typed.\n\nThey also say they made repeated attempts to get a meeting with Ngubo to talk about their problems, but were ignored.\n\nAmong the things they wished to discuss with her included the condition of their office in Publicity House, where the windows were apparently stuck and the air conditioner malfunctioned.\n\n\u201cWhen we eventually met with the manager in her office [Blessing Dlamini] he said we were not entitled to overtime even though we are also municipal employees and should be getting all the benefits.\u201d\n\nWard 25 assistant Ndumiso Chamane told The Witness they could not understand why they were not allowed to claim overtime like other municipal employees when they are expected to work in the evenings and weekends.\n\nWard 29\u2019s Mlu Zondi said their other grievance had to do with the unauthorised deductions on their salaries.\n\nHe said they started noticing these six months ago when between R200 and R1 000 was taken.\n\nMbali Phungula, from ward 37, said they have sent two memorandums to Ngubo\u2019s office requesting a meeting with her, but they have been ignored.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Dlamini said when he interviewed the ward assistants, before their appointments, he asked them if they would be willing to work overtime and then take time off in lieu and they agreed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that they also wanted financial compensation but if that\u2019s the case then we will discuss it with them in our next meeting,\u201d he added.\n\nDlamini said the issue of overtime would also require Msunduzi to monitor the assistants as they currently came and went as they pleased.\n\nHe said he would investigate the unauthorised deductions with the pay office and report back to the ward assistants.\n\nWith regards to the working conditions, he said all the offices were supplied with phones and only four did not have computers, as they were either stolen or damaged by fire.\n\nHe said the assistants, however, were aware that they could come to his office anytime and use the available computers there.\n\nDlamini said he was aware of the situation at the Publicity House office and would engage with Ngubo on the matter. He said the assistants who regularly use that office were volunteers but he was trying to get them into the expanded public works programme so that they could get a stipend.", "description": "Ward councillors\u2019 assistants want Msunduzi to pay them for overtime worked since 2016 and to stop the \u201cillegal\u201d deductions on their salaries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9001/236c48204c5b480688a6b631b8a7b14a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
