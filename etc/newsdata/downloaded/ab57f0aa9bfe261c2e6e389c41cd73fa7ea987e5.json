Another classmate, Joshua Jones also joined in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of running and hiding,\u201d Mr. Bialy told reporters at the time. \u201cEverybody hopes what they\u2019re going to do \u2026 what I did. I acted the way that I hoped [I would have] acted.\u201d\n\nMr. Bialy was uninjured other than some scrapes on his knees, but Castillo was killed in the scuffle and Mr. Jones suffered two gunshot wounds. Eight other students were injured.\n\n\u201cKendrick Castillo died a legend,\u201d Mr. Bialy said. \u201cI know he will be with me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nStaff Sgt. Marcus Chestnut \u2014 one of Bialy\u2019s drill instructors \u2014 said his \u201cquick reaction [and] willingness to fight\u201d are exactly what the Marines are looking for, Stars and Stripes reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think recruit training changed Bialy,\u201d Sgt. Chestnut said. \u201cHe is who he was when he first got here. I think we just gave him some additional attributes that made him a stronger man and a basically trained Marine.\u201d\n\nThe two shooting suspects \u2014 Devon Erickson, 18, and Alec McKinney, 16 \u2014 were apprehended and taken into custody.\n\nThe Associated Press reported the older suspect will be tried on more than 40 charges, including murder, while the younger, underage suspect will have a preliminary hearing on charges next month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
