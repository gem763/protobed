It would be like a zoo.\"\n\n'SILENT AINU'\n\nScholars say the Ainu settled in Japan's northernmost island and across Sakhalin, Russia, by the 1300s. They hunted, fished, practiced an animist religion and spoke a language unrelated to any other.\n\nJapan took control of Hokkaido by force in the 19th Century and made it a colony. After opening it to Japanese settlers, it forced the Ainu, which it labelled \"former aborigines,\" to assimilate.\n\nA 2017 survey counted just over 13,000 Ainu in Hokkaido. The actual number is estimated to be much higher, because many Ainu fear identifying as other than Japanese and have moved to different parts of the country.\n\nIndigenous Ainu Teruyo Usa's daughter Ruino learns a traditional Ainu song from her mother and relatives at her mother's restaurant in Tokyo.

She describes people detached from their roots as\"silent Ainu.\"\n\nIn 2009, after signing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Japan's government began considering how to establish a new policy for the Ainu. Early proposals zeroed in quickly on the creation of the government-funded \"Symbolic Space\" now taking shape on the shore of Lake Poroto near the town of Shiraoi in Hokkaido.\n\nIn consultations that concluded in early 2018, Ainu representatives asked for legal rights to state-owned land, more funding for teaching Ainu culture and language and an apology from Japan's government.\n\nNone of those proposals was considered.\n\n\"We can't do something if it is not achievable,\" said Hiroshi Koyama, the official in charge of Japan's Comprehensive Ainu Policy Office.\n\nGiving back forest where Ainu once hunted and foraged, he said, would \"be hard for the Japanese people to accept.\" And he added that an apology would be uncomfortable for many Japanese, as well as an insult to the Japanese settlers who built modern Hokkaido.\n\n\"It would focus people's attention on the bad things that happened and not the future,\" he said.\n\nAinu hunter Atsushi Monbetsu (R), drinks beer with his Ainu friend Taichi Kaizawa (L) and ethnic Japanese friend Jun Honda at a barbecue at Kaizawa's house in Biratori, Hokkaido.

Five of the 20 curators hired for the new museum are Ainu.\n\nAt a former school a short drive from the museum construction site, curators are preparing exhibits. Traditional Ainu coats hang in abandoned classrooms with knives, ceremonial sticks and heavy beaded necklaces laid out on tables. In the gymnasium, dancers practice next to stuffed bears and Ainu handicrafts.\n\nWith pictures of smiling performers, a draft brochure describes Ainu hunter-gatherer culture as \"on the verge of extinction.\" It makes no reference to Japanese policies that forced Ainu to adopt Japanese names, speak Japanese and outlawed practices such as a traditional form of tattooing Hachiya is trying to revive.\n\nHachiya, 36, who is also a singer, has been asked to practice a routine with other Ainu performers that may be included in the Olympics opening ceremony in Tokyo.\n\n\"I think Hokkaido is a Japanese colony,\" she said. \"That's a hard thing to say, but if you look back on what was done, that's what you have to conclude.\"\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "On a wooded lake shore in northern Japan, the government is building a modernist shrine that has divided the indigenous Ainu community whose vanishing culture it was designed to celebrate.
