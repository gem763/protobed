REUTERS/Patpicha Tanakasempipat\n\nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) could become the world\u2019s largest free trade zone, comprising 16 countries that account for a third of global gross domestic product and nearly half the world\u2019s population.\n\nProgress since talks began in 2012 has been slowed by disagreements between members, such as major Indian concerns over a possible deluge of imports from China. The pact also includes the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nAnalysts said the pace of discussion on remaining issues had quickened this year, as the U.S.-China trade war sharpened concerns over both economic growth and regional security.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing that there is light at the end of the tunnel and it is already a short tunnel,\u201d said Tang Siew Mun, head of the ASEAN Studies Centre at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is now there for the politicians to get this done,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThailand, which currently chairs ASEAN, said this month market access talks were 80.4% complete and members had agreed on 14 of a total of 20 chapters. Talks with RCEP members will follow the ASEAN summit, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 4, in Bangkok.\n\n\u201cSome Southeast Asian nations would like to show that they can keep the regional integration show on the road, despite the U.S.-China tensions,\u201d said Benjamin Bland, director of the Southeast Asia project at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.\n\nIn Asia, China is not alone in feeling the pressure of the trade war.\n\nAlthough some companies have moved production from China to escape U.S. tariffs, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts growth in ASEAN\u2019s top five economies will fall to 4.8% this year from 5.3% in 2018. It expects India\u2019s growth to slow to 6.1% from 6.8%.\n\nCountries that used to rely on the United States as a counterweight to China\u2019s growing regional dominance are also increasingly doubtful if they can.\n\nRCEP members including India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand all have large trade surpluses with the United States - a bugbear for President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S.-Thai trade relations have been strained, with Washington withdrawing trade preferences on $1.3 billion in Thai goods last Friday, accusing Thailand of failing to protect workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWARNING SIGN\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trade tensions should be the final warning sign that Asia needs to have a collective platform and a place for engaging in economic issues,\u201d said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Center based in Singapore.\n\nIt would be a \u201cmassive missed opportunity\u201d if leaders did not announce the success of the pact at this week\u2019s meeting, Elms added.\n\nThe RCEP trade deal aims to build on the free trade deals that Southeast Asian countries have with other members.\n\nIt has been widely seen as a China-supported alternative to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which covers 11 countries across the Pacific - though Trump pulled the United States out of talks before it was signed.\n\nRCEP, seven of whose member nations are also in the other agreement, is less ambitious in terms of the areas of trade that would be freed up and the conditions participants must meet.\n\nBut it is still expected to provide a major boost to regional trade, besides being symbolically important, as the Trump administration challenges multilateral trade deals.\n\n\u201cCompleting the RCEP negotiations as early as possible is of great significance to the long-term stability, prosperity and development of the region,\u201d Li Chenggang, China\u2019s assistant commerce minister told reporters in Beijing on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations are currently in the final sprint.\u201d\n\nChinese premier Li Keqiang is confirmed to attend the Bangkok meet, while the United States has yet to announce any representative more senior than Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell.\n\nLast year, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence joined the meeting with Southeast Asian leaders in Trump\u2019s place.\n\nOther issues that may figure at the Southeast Asian summit include the standoff between China and several regional states over its sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea, as well as Myanmar\u2019s treatment of Muslim Rohingya after a military crackdown drove more than 700,000 into Bangladesh in 2017.\n\nBut with Thai hosts keen to show progress on the RCEP deal, analysts and diplomats say it is shaping up as the most important issue in Bangkok.\n\n\u201cASEAN hopes to at least be able to announce that substantial progress has been made, to ensure momentum is sustained,\u201d said Peter Mumford of risk consulting firm Eurasia Group.", "description": "Tensions between the United States and China have given new impetus to a China-backed trade pact and there is a chance of major progress, if not final agreement, when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Bangkok this week, analysts say.", "authors": ["Patpicha Tanakasempipat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446103177&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0EW", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
