Bank of Russia Cuts Rate for Third Time, Signals More Easing\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia pushed through its third consecutive interest-rate cut and said more monetary easing is possible at an upcoming meeting as inflation dropped closer to a 4% target.\n\nThe benchmark rate was cut to 7% from 7.25%, according to a statement published on Friday. The move to the lowest level since March 2014 was forecast by 33 economists out of 35 in a Bloomberg survey, with one analyst forecasting a bigger cut and one expecting no change.\n\n\u201cIf the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of a further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming board of directors\u2019 meetings,\u201d the central bank said in a statement.\n\nBank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3pm in Moscow.\n\nThe central bank renewed its easing cycle in June after a couple of rate hikes last year to stem risks to inflation from a tax rise. Some economists had suggested recent ruble weakness and proposals for an increase in spending may limit easing going forward.\n\nKey Insights", "description": "Bank of Russia Cuts Rate for Third Time, Signals More Easing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1B0HG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
