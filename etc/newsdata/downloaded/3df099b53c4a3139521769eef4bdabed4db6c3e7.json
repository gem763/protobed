Given all the ResistanceBucks\u2122 the left showered on him after he was fired, it\u2019s only proper that he return the favor.\n\nDid I miss a news story somewhere or isn\u2019t this guy still under threat of indictment? The interest in him lately from across the aisle would have you believe that he\u2019s a political rising star, not a man staring at the possibility of prison. He just landed a CNN contributor\u2019s gig, he has a book out, now he\u2019s giving speeches for the opposition party in 2020 swing states. When did Andrew McCabe become Stacey Abrams? Are Democrats lining him up for a House run or something?\n\nIn the age of FaceTime and Skype, he could conduct a front-porch campaign from behind the glass at the federal pen, I suppose.\n\nMcCabe is now also participating in Democratic fundraising events. According to the Pennsylvania Democratic Party\u2019s website, McCabe is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a fundraising banquet for the Lancaster County Democratic Committee. Tickets for the event, which can be purchased through ActBlue, range from $80 to $160. The more expensive \u201cSpeaker\u2019s Circle\u201d tickets come with access to a private reception with McCabe and photograph with him. He is scheduled to speak for 45 minutes and take questions for 15 minutes, according to the site\u2026 McCabe told event organizers that he plans to discuss his \u201cone-on-one interactions with Donald Trump\u201d during the event. He also will cover the \u201cfallout and aftermath\u201d of former FBI director James Comey\u2019s firing, \u201cRussian meddling in the 2016 election,\u201d and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe idea of hating Trump so much that you\u2019d pop for 160 bucks for a personal photo with Andrew McCabe fills me with a degree of dread normally only experienced when contemplating death. It\u2019s one notch up from paying for an audience with the Krassenstein brothers.\n\nFor cripes sake, you can buy a house in parts of the midwest for $160. In Detroit, certainly.\n\nMy first thought upon hearing that McCabe was now in demand on the Democratic political circuit was naturally, \u201cWhat about Comey?\u201d If McCabe\u2019s appeal to the left derives from Trump\u2019s antipathy to him, surely a man whom Trump loathes even more like Big Jim would be that much more appealing. Plus, Comey was nearly charged by the DOJ for his anti-Trump activities in leaking memos. What better proof of commitment to the Resistance could there be than that? He\u2019s even been donating money to the party! But then I remembered: Oh, right, his last-minute letter about reopening the Emailgate probe may have tanked Hillary\u2019s chances of winning the election, thus enabling the very presidency that Democrats so despise. Comey will never overcome that to regain respectability among them, no matter how many nasty tweets Trump posts about him. He\u2019ll have to watch the Democratic romance with disgraced Trump-hating former FBI officials play out from the outside, with his face pressed against the window.", "description": "Redemption.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/a-1.jpg"}
