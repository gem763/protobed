Later in the day, however, a clip from Gillis\u2019s podcast, Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast, was surfaced on Twitter by freelance writer and comedy reporter Seth Simons. In it, Gillis and co-host Matt McCusker make a series of racist comments about Chinese people and use racist, mocking accents. Early in the first clip, Gillis says, while referring to Chinatown, \u201cWhy do the fucking ch*nks live there?\u201d In another clip from the same episode, Gillis jokes about being annoyed by Asian people trying to learn English, adding, \u201cNice racism. Good racism.\u201d\n\ntoday SNL announced the hiring of its first cast member of East Asian descent, and also this guy pic.twitter.com/0FAGJZJUkK \u2014 Seth Simons (@sasimons) September 12, 2019\n\nthis, again, is from September 2018 pic.twitter.com/inYFT22zjl \u2014 Seth Simons (@sasimons) September 12, 2019\n\nIn the below clip from another episode, around the 12:00 mark, Gillis and McCusker chat about comedians who adopt a more confessional style, like Judd Apatow and Chris Gethard, and mock them using homophobic slurs, calling them \u201cwhite f*ggot comics\u201d and \u201cfucking gayer than ISIS.\u201d Earlier in the clip, around 2:20, the co-hosts rank how funny comedians are by race, gender, and sexual orientation. \u201cWhite chicks are literally the bottom,\u201d Gillis says. \u201cAli Wong is making it so Asian chicks are funnier than white chicks.\u201d\n\nThe clips shared on Twitter are from a podcast episode released in September 2018, so unlike other Twitter-comedian controversies involving Trevor Noah and Melissa Villase\u00f1or, which were over (mostly) old tweets, the resurfaced comments are all fairly new. Also unlike Noah and Villase\u00f1or, Gillis seems to have anticipated that his past remarks would come back to haunt him, because all of the past episodes of Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast have been scrubbed from its YouTube channel.\n\nIt all raises the question: Did Saturday Night Live vet its new cast members? It\u2019s 2019, so at this point, there\u2019s really no excuse for this kind of slip-up. (Representatives for the show did not respond to a request for comment.) And while Gillis clearly put some effort into scraping his history from the internet beforehand, there\u2019s an entire subreddit dedicated to his podcast that\u2019s filled with homophobic slurs, even against current SNL writers, and it\u2019s very easy to find on Google. Beyond that, sources in the Philadelphia comedy scene \u2014 where Gillis lived and performed from 2014 through last year \u2014 tell Vulture they were surprised to see the SNL casting news today given Gillis\u2019s material. \u201cGood Good Comedy Theatre stopped working with him within the past few years because of racist, homophobic, and sexist things he\u2019s said on and offstage,\u201d said Kate Banford, co-owner of the comedy theater. Another source added, \u201cJust want to say as a comedian who came up in Philly comedy at the time Shane was blowing up, [it] was extremely discouraging! As a queer female-bodied comedian, a man using the language he did and got so much recognition for was really disheartening.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most disheartening thing to come out of these resurfaced clips of Gillis\u2019s homophobic and racist remarks, particularly against Asians, is how it stains what\u2019s otherwise been a celebratory day for comedy fans excited to see Bowen Yang rise from SNL writer to cast member, considering both gay men and Asians have had next to no onscreen representation on the long-running NBC series. Unfortunately, Gillis\u2019s apparent tendency to deliver racism and homophobia instead of jokes stole the spotlight.\n\nUpdate, 10:55 p.m.: Gillis posted a statement about his remarks on Twitter tonight. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d", "description": "Clips have surfaced online of one of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019s newest cast members, stand-up Shane Gillis, making sexist, homophobic, and racist remarks on his podcast.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-shane-gillis.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
