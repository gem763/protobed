I kill my darlings left, right and centre'", "language": "en", "text": "His new novel about to hit bookstores, the bestselling author reflects on Scrublands\u2019 success \u2013 and writing by the seat of his pants\n\nChris Hammer\u2019s career as a political advisor was meteoric and very, very short.\n\nThree weeks after he started a job with Labor MP Stephen Jones, he got \u201cthis fantastic book deal\u201d. \u201cI was laughing and crying, it was just unbelievable,\u201d he says.\n\nThat was a Friday. On the Monday, he resigned. \u201cStephen was most gracious about it all.\u201d\n\nShortly after that, the international and television rights to Scrublands, Hammer\u2019s debut novel, were sold. Overnight he had became that rare, elusive thing: a writer who could make a decent living from fiction. Yet even now he has difficulty calling himself an author. \u201cIt is even more difficult to say I am a novelist,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia.\n\nWe meet in the piano bar of the showy Emporium hotel on Brisbane\u2019s South Bank in the lead-up to publication of Hammer\u2019s second novel, Silver. The hotel is a nice perk of being a bestselling author travelling on book business.Prior to Scrublands, Hammer had written two non-fiction books about the Australian landscape: The River (2011) and The Coast (2013), both of which were well received but didn\u2019t make him any money, and he still felt as if calling himself a \u201cwriter\u201d was unwarranted.\n\nThea Astley's writing was convoluted and obtuse \u2013 and it made me fall in love with words | Toni Jordan Read more\n\n\u201cI found I couldn\u2019t describe myself as a writer because I wasn\u2019t making a living out of it,\u201d he says.\n\nScrublands is an epic, atmospheric crime novel, full of the ferocious heat of the drought in the Riverina, a scorched landscape flattened by hardship. The revelations come in layers and nothing is as it first appears.\n\nThe book proved as popular with audiences as publishers had hoped, sitting in bestseller lists for months. Not too shabby for a \u201cbit of a hobby retirement project\u201d written in \u201cstolen moments here and there\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Hammer: \u2018I rewrote the end of Scrublands \u2013 the last 40,000 or 50,000 words \u2013 twice.\u2019 Photograph: Mike Bowers\n\n\u201cI deliberately didn\u2019t aspire to some sort of literary masterpiece,\u201d says Hammer. \u201cIt is genre fiction, crime writing. I thought you would have a launch, your friends would come and slap you on the back and then it would disappear without trace.\u201d\n\nHammer was a journalist for more than 30 years, including for Fairfax and SBS current affairs project Dateline, the last of those years spent amid the agonising decline of print media. Working in print journalism gave him the discipline required to write a novel in his spare time. \u201cYou don\u2019t romanticise it, it\u2019s just something you do. You don\u2019t say \u2018I won\u2019t write today because I\u2019m not feeling inspired.\u2019 Imagine a journalist ringing an editor and saying \u2018I can\u2019t file today because I am not inspired.\u2019 You are in the habit and if you don\u2019t do it, you don\u2019t feel right.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Allen & Unwin\n\nIn Silver, Hammer brings back his flawed Scrublands protagonist, journalist and former foreign correspondent Martin Scarsden. Scarsden returns to Port Silver, the town in which he grew up, to live with his girlfriend, Mandalay. He arrives to discover his old school friend, lying on the floor of Mandalay\u2019s house with a knife plunged into his back and a postcard in his hand.\n\nHammer\u2019s writing is enveloping, lyrical, evoking a profound sense of place. While Scrublands was parched, Silver is about the sea, a fecund place, lingering on the natural beauty of the coast and its pristine bays threatened by ruthless developers. The plot, meanwhile, is complex, sometimes bordering on preposterous as the body count rises. \u201cIt is like a portable Midsomer,\u201d Hammer jokes.\n\nSilver also draws out the details of Scarsden\u2019s troubled childhood, a history that Hammer is quick to remind readers is fiction. \u201cMartin\u2019s life was quite traumatic, whereas mine was boringly suburban. I don\u2019t have post-traumatic stress, I have been married for 21 years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I travelled I ran into people like Martin who were traumatised by covering conflict zones, natural disasters like the tsunami in Aceh. If you are doing it all the time it is going to mess you up.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There are some days where it just flows out and it\u2019s almost like you are reading the book rather than writing it.\u2019 Photograph: Mike Bowers\n\nSilver\u2019s plot is full of twists and turns, raising inevitable questions about its author\u2019s planning process. \u201cI have learned that crime writers are divided into plotters and [seat of the] pantsers,\u201d Hammer explains. \u201cPantsers are people who just start writing and don\u2019t know how it is going to end.\u201d\n\nHammer says he is definitely at the pants end of the spectrum. \u201cI rewrote the end of Scrublands \u2013 the last 40,000 or 50,000 words \u2013 twice, because I got a better idea. There are some days where it just flows out and it\u2019s almost like you are reading the book rather than writing it, and you can\u2019t wait to get up and start writing because you want to know what happens next.\u201d\n\nStella Count shows gender bias in book reviews is changing Read more\n\nFor as many people who die on the pages of Hammer\u2019s books, there are more who died before they even got there. \u201cYou often hear in writing circles about \u2018killing your darlings\u2019 when it is something you really love and you\u2019ll find difficult to let it go. I am a serial killer. I kill my darlings left, right and centre. I threw out at least 100,000 words writing Scrublands. If it doesn\u2019t work, it goes.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year he signed another two-book deal with Allen and Unwin, and a separate two-book deal with Headline in the UK.\n\nDaunting as this is, he says he is still learning and hopes this doesn\u2019t represent his career peak. \u201cI want to do better. I would be really disappointed if in 10 years time Scrublands was my best book.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Silver by Chris Hammer is out on 1 October through Allen & Unwin", "description": "His new novel about to hit bookstores, the bestselling author reflects on Scrublands\u2019 success \u2013 and writing by the seat of his pants", "authors": ["Susan Chenery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4c058508fc56a2441a363ba9e486b3aff426d4/2140_127_2482_1489/master/2482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7424f33ae184941ed66209755b64ab44", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
