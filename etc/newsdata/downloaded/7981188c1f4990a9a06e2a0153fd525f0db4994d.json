As to these activists, it wants to drag them into the lengthy judicial processes, with the possibility of spending months in the detention center before the next court hearing, and therefore bar them from joining future protests.\n\nBut both Joshua and Agnes stated clearly: they are not afraid of the persecution and will continue to fight for Hong Kong\u2019s people. This sense of dedication will definitely boost the morale of other protestors and encourage even more people to remain committed to the movement.\n\nThis series of arrests is also a part of the government\u2019s attempt to demobilize the movement. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) hopes that the movement will crumble as soon as alleged \u201cleaders\u201d are arrested and the \u201cforeign patrons\u201d behind the scenes are revealed.\n\nAs part of this, Beijing launched a disinformation campaign, employing hundreds of fake social media accounts to discredit the movement and brand the protestors as brainwashed and incentivized by \u201cforeign influence\u201d and money. By sentencing activists whom they present as foreign agents, they hope that this wave of legal prosecutions will deter \u201cmisguided\u201d people from protesting and bring an end to the movement.\n\nThis is an ill-founded belief. On one hand, it fails to comprehend the defining features of the movement, which is decentralized and leaderless. It also denigrates the will of millions of creative and independently minded citizens who genuinely demand freedom and democracy.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201cwhite terror\u201d tactic has clearly backfired. Instead of being intimidated, people are now filled with anger at these vicious detentions and spurred to challenge the actions of the government. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the police force was again seen brutally assaulting protestors or even ordinary civilians on the metro station platform and in train compartments. The arbitrary use of violence definitely fuelled another round of enormous protest.\n\nWhile the strategy of the CCP appears to have failed, their intention remains clear \u2013 31 August was perceived to be a sensitive date, a moment to send a strong signal to forestall any major protest. Why sensitive? Well five years ago, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), the decision making body of the CCP, issued the notorious \u201c831 White Paper\u201d that in essence ruled out genuine democratization in Hong Kong and ignited the famous Umbrella Movement in 2014.\n\nRead more\n\nThis White Paper, if implemented, will allow Beijing to hand-pick the candidates in future chief executive elections and deprive Hong Kong people of their right to freely elect their leaders. By staging another major protest on the same day, protestors now make it exceedingly clear that the movement has evolved into a battle for freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong.\n\nAlongside the political persecution, it is widely rumored that chief executive Carrie Lam is considering implementation of the \u201cEmergency Law,\u201d empowering herself with wide and extreme discretion to curtail citizens\u2019 freedom in order to defuse the crisis. Meanwhile, she is also baiting the protestors into so-called dialogues that have been proven to be only words, and no deeds.\n\nThis combination of tactics, however cunning, fails to address the core issue of the movement. The \u201cproblem to be solved\u201d in Carrie Lam\u2019s eyes is how to end this series of protests; but for protestors, the real issue is the systematic encroachment on our liberty and the city\u2019s autonomy. If the dialogues are not backed by substantive reform to address the structural problems in our political system and make no concession to the protestors\u2019 demands, they are merely window dressing for the regime. There is no incentive for us to join them.\n\nThe threat of \u201cEmergency Law\u201d is also likely to be a scare tactic. Passed in the colonial era, this draconian measure allows Lam to abuse a huge stock of executive power by arbitrarily arresting and evicting citizens, or freezing and confiscating the properties of individuals or companies.", "description": "Right before another major protest in Hong Kong on Saturday, three legislative councillors and three prominent activists were arrested, my fellows Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow among them.This was political retaliation wrapped in legalese, designed to take on two people who have demonstrated tremendous", "authors": ["Nathan Law Kwun-Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2JxmYjp0SU_Uxmba9PB7XA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a9dc1f6f2882a400b0ffb61850de5255"}
