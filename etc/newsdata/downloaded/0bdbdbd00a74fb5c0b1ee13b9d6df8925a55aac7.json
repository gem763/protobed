By the evening as trick-or-treaters head out, that cloud will spread to more north eastern parts of Wales.\n\n\"But it will be foggy adding an eerie feel to the evening and night.\"\n\nA netweather.tv spokesman said: \"During Thursday, it will be cloudy and damp over more of Britain for a time then wet for Ireland during Thursday evening and night. It will become milder as the wind veer to a southerly flow.\n\n\"Friday will be blustery with a fresh south then south-west wind.\n\n\"Heavier rain looks set to move across Britain early on Friday as a low pressure settles to the north-west.\n\n\"This means there will be unsettled conditions Friday into the weekend with sharp showers, blustery winds and further bands of rain.\n\n\"And as another low pressure heads in from the SW later on Saturday for Sunday bringing even more rain and showers it looks like there will be further flooding issues. It also looks very windy.\"\n\nIt will be a chilly start for many this morning, with lows of -3C in parts of north Scotland.\n\nHighs of 12C are expected but much of the country will see single digit temperatures today, although the mercury will climb over 10C in some places.\n\nTonight there will be cloud and rain in Wales, southern and south-west England but it will be chilly with clear spells elsewhere.\n\nThrough the night, rain will spread northwards into Northern Ireland, central and south-east England.\n\nTomorrow morning it will be cloudy with outbreaks of rain in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but Scotland will be mostly dry and cloudy with the odd bright spell in the north.\n\nRain will spread into southern Scotland after noon but it will remain dry in the north.\n\nOn Friday it will be mostly grey and overcast with outbreaks of light rain and drizzle, although some showers in southern England are likely to be heavy.\n\nSaturday will be cloudy as a band of heavy rain spreads eastwards across the country.\n\nMet Office five-day weather forecast\n\nToday:\n\nRain will continue at times across parts of southwest England, perhaps heavy in the far southwest. Otherwise, apart from the odd shower near to east-facing coasts, most areas fine with some sunshine after any fog clears.\n\nTonight:\n\nMany areas fine with clear spells, allowing some frost in northern areas, and a few fog patches mainly in northern Scotland. Southwest Britain still largely cloudy, rain tending to ease.\n\nThursday:\n\nPatchy rain in southwest Britain spreading north to Northern Ireland and perhaps some western fringes of Wales and Scotland. Hill fog in southwest. Further east, mainly dry with some sunshine.\n\nOutlook for Friday to Sunday:\n\nMany areas starting fine with patchy night frost. Rain and misty conditions in southwest England will become more widespread by Friday, before heavy rain and gales sweep in for Saturday.", "description": "Heavy rain is expected to return this weekend, bringing an end to the brief bright spell and raising the prospect of further flooding", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Alamy Live News."], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Flintshire-UK-29th-October-2019-UK-Weather-Cold-weather-and-clear-skies-as-temperatures-dropped.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
