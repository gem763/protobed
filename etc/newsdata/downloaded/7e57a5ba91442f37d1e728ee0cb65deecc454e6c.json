Prosecutors allege Mozambican government officials, corporate executives and investment bankers stole about $200 million in loan proceeds.\n\nDefense lawyer Michael Schachter told jurors in opening statements that Boustani had nothing to do with the sale or marketing of loans to investors nor had he defrauded them. Pearse got the \u201csweetest of sweatheart deals\u201d from the U.S. and was testifying against Boustani to avoid prison, Schachter told the jury.\n\nThe Credit Suisse loans were for three separate maritime projects including a tuna fishing fleet, the building of a shipyard and surveillance operation to protect Mozambique\u2019s coastline, he said. Prosecutors say Privinvest officials charged Mozambique inflated prices for equipment and services, freeing up money for bribery payments.\n\nSurjan Singh and Datelina Subeva, two former Credit Suisse bankers who Pearse said were involved, will also testify for the government, lawyers said Wednesday. Both pleaded guilty.\n\nPearse told jurors that former Credit Suisse colleagues who introduced Privinvest to the bank -- Said Freiha and Adel Afiouni -- also made a multimillion-dollar profit after a company they established while working at the bank was bought by Privinvest for more than $10 million.\n\n\u201cThe defendant told me they were silent partners with him,\u201d Pearse said. When asked if both men were at Credit Suisse at the time, Pearse replied, \u201cYes, that\u2019s why the defendant described them as \u2018silent.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeither Freiha, Afiouni nor Credit Suisse have been charged with wrongdoing. Karina Byrne, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse, declined to comment as did John Marzulli, a spokesman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue. Freiha and Afiouni are no longer at the bank and neither man returned an email sent after business hours seeking comment about Pearse\u2019s testimony.\n\nFour Mozambican officials also got millions of dollars in kickbacks from Privinvest, and the son of the country\u2019s then-president, Armando Guebuza, collected at least $50 million in illegal payments, according to Pearse.\n\n\u201cThe son introduced the defendant to his father and to the ministers in the Mozambique government who were necessary for the project to proceed,\u201d Pearse said.\n\nNdambi Guebuza, the former president\u2019s son, once demanded Boustani pay him an additional 11 million euros (R180m), Pearse testified.\n\n\u201cHe was living in the South of France and asked to buy a house for himself and a prostitute he\u2019d fallen in love with,\u201d Pearse said. \u201cHe wanted 11 million euros to buy a house with the prostitute.\u201c\n\nWhen he expressed surprise at Ndambi Guebuza\u2019s request, Pearse said Boustani only shrugged, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, given the $50 million I already paid him.\u201d\n\nNdambi Guebuza was arrested by Mozambican authorities in February. He\u2019s fighting the charges.\n\nPearse continues his testimony Thursday.", "description": "Former Credit Suisse Group AG banker Andrew Pearse told a jury in New York, that he pocketed at least $45 million (R650m) in illicit payments for his role in the arrangement of loans worth $2 billion to companies in Mozambique.", "authors": ["Patricia Hurtado"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/123/f0001af5e1f94e38b6f5eaeaab874193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
