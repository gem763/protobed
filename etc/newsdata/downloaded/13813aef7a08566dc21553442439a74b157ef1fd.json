Photo: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nFrench modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel has been the subject of disturbing sexual-abuse allegations for decades. Way back in the late 1980s, numerous American models accused him of fostering an abusive culture at his agencies, though he faced no criminal consequences. More recently, his alleged behavior has come under increased scrutiny due to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein: a billionaire financier accused of operating a sex ring of underage girls, for which Brunel was alleged to have recruited young women. (He\u2019s also been accused of partaking in the alleged sex ring.) After Epstein was found dead by apparent suicide in his jail cell in early August, and nationwide focus turned toward his alleged accomplices, Brunel vanished.\n\nIn the time that Brunel was missing, the allegations against him only mounted: In mid-August, two models accused Brunel of sexual assault, which in part compelled French officials to launch a criminal investigation into charges that Brunel had sexually assaulted women and minors in France. Then, on September 24, le Parisien reported that Brunel had been found in South America, after weeks of being in hiding.\n\nSo \u2026 what happens now? Below, everything we know about the allegations against Jean-Luc Brunel and the charges he faces.\n\nHe\u2019s a modeling agent.\n\nBrunel, 72, is the former head of Karin Models and MC2, two prestigious international modeling agencies. Per the Daily Beast, Brunel was also Epstein\u2019s \u201cclosest pal,\u201d and one \u201cthe financier\u2019s most frequent male associates.\u201d\n\nHe allegedly fostered a culture of abuse at his modeling agencies.\n\nIn 1987, American models who worked with Brunel went on 60 Minutes and described the abusive culture that Brunel allegedly fostered. In the episode, they say they were pressured into having sex with men out of fear that their career would suffer if they turned them down. Additionally, two of the featured women accused Brunel of drugging them; of those two, one said Brunel raped her while she was unconscious. (In an interview with the Daily Beast, Craig Pyes, who helped report the 60 Minutes episode, said more models than the ones who appeared on the episode spoke to him about assault they had allegedly suffered in Brunel\u2019s circle \u2014 they just didn\u2019t want to come forward on television.) Brunel, who did not appear in the episode, denied the models\u2019 allegations against him.\n\nThe allegations continued to mount. In Ian Halperin\u2019s 2003 book Bad and Beautiful, a former Karin model recounted an incident in which Brunel and his friends invited more than ten models to a party, saying that they were forced to have sex with the men. \u201cMost of the women felt they had been raped,\u201d the former model said, per the Daily Beast. \u201cBut they were afraid to report it to the police because Brunel would ruin their careers.\u201d\n\nThree former models have directly accused him of sexual assault.\n\nOver the past few decades, three models have alleged that Brunel sexually assaulted them in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris.\n\nThe first model who accused him was Courtney Soerensen, one of the models featured on 60 Minutes. She says that in 1988, when she was 19, she traveled from her home in Pennsylvania to Paris, where Brunel made sexual advances toward her, and ruined her career when she declined them.\n\n\u201cHe would get very handsy, start groping me, try to kiss me, try to get me to lay down on the bed just to \u2018try it out,\u2019\u201d Soerensen recently told the Guardian. \u201cHe would try to untuck my shirt, wanting to \u2018see my abs.\u2019 He would grab my breasts and put his hand on my bottom. There was one time where he rubbed himself up against me.\u201d\n\nThe two other models who have accused Brunel of sexual assault came forward in mid-August of this year \u2014 after Brunel was already hiding. In a report published in the Guardian, Dutch model Thysia Huisman accused Brunel of spiking her drink and raping her in 1991, when she was just 18. After her agents suggested that she meet with Brunel, who was then at Karin Models, Huisman traveled to his Paris apartment, where he offered to let her stay; she says she was uncomfortable there, as she recalls being surrounded by older businessmen and young models who appeared to be sleeping together, but that she stuck it out for her career. On her last day staying at the apartment, Huisman says Brunel took her to his bedroom without her consent after giving her a drink that made her \u201cwoozy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember trying to move, but not really being able to,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cLike almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse, a black blouse, ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him \u2014 this is difficult \u2014 between my legs. Pushing.\u201d\n\nThe other former model, who has requested anonymity, says Brunel \u2014 who scouted her in the U.S. \u2014 assaulted her outside Paris in the mid 1980s, when she was around 20 years old. While she does not recall the exact location of the alleged assault, as she says Brunel drove her to an estate in an area she didn\u2019t recognize, she recalls the details of the alleged assault with clarity.\n\nAfter Brunel took a shower, the woman says he \u201cwas grabbing [her] breasts and [her] crotch,\u201d while she kept saying, \u201cWhy are you doing this? I don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d She says she escaped by getting out onto the window ledge, where she slept through the night.\n\nBrunel has not responded to the two recent accusations.\n\nBrunel was allegedly one of Epstein\u2019s most frequent associates.\n\nBoth Brunel and Epstein allegedly had proclivities for sexual relations with nonconsenting underage girls, so it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the two eventually cozied up to one another. While the exact date that Brunel and Epstein met is yet unclear, the Daily Beast reports that it was no later than the 2005 launch of MC2, which Epstein financed.\n\nIn a 2015 affidavit, Virginia Giuffre \u2014 one of the dozens of women who have accused Epstein and his powerful friends of abusing her when she was underage \u2014 claimed that Brunel \u201ccould get dozens of underage girls and feed Epstein\u2019s strong appetite for sex with minors.\u201d How Brunel would do this, Giuffre claimed, would be by promising young girls \u201cgood money\u201d; then, Brunel would \u201cfarm [the girls] out to his friends,\u201d such as Epstein, \u201cfor sexual purposes.\u201d Giuffre, who claims she was forced to have sex with Brunel, also said in the affidavit that Epstein bragged to her that he had \u201cslept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls.\u201d\n\n(In response to Giuffre\u2019s allegations, Brunel said in a statement in 2015, \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work.\u201d)\n\nMore recently, Brunel\u2019s name appeared in the recently unsealed court documents from 2015 that shed a damning light on Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking ring. Included in the documents were telephone messages to Epstein, which featured a note \u201cfor Jeffrey, from Jean Luc,\u201d in which Brunel appears to be offering Epstein an underage girl. The message reads: \u201cHe has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.\u201d\n\nAt some point, Brunel\u2019s relationship with Epstein turned sour. In January 2015, Brunel sued Epstein over the \u201cadverse publicity surrounding Epstein and his illegal activities,\u201d and claimed that it had left him \u201cemotionally destroyed.\u201d\n\nBrunel is under investigation by Parisian officials.\n\nBetween the new allegations against Brunel and Epstein\u2019s ownership of an apartment in Paris, French authorities decided in August to launch their own investigation into potential sex crimes committed against French citizens. The week leading up to Brunel\u2019s discovery, French investigators searched his home, the Karin Models office, and Epstein\u2019s apartment, ABC News reports.\n\nPer the Telegraph, what will happen next to Brunel is yet to be determined, as it\u2019s unclear whether he has spoken to French prosecutors. Earlier this month, though, French police urged potential victims or witnesses with ties to Epstein to come forward to help their investigation.\n\n[#Appel\u00e0T\u00e9moins] La #police judiciaire, sous la direction du Parquet de Paris, recherche des t\u00e9moins dans l'affaire #Epstein.\n\nDes policiers sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s sont mobilis\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nSi vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 victime ou t\u00e9moin, contactez:\n\n\ud83d\udcde 06 83 67 43 57\n\n\ud83d\udce9 temoignage-ocrvp@interieur.gouv.fr pic.twitter.com/gkhSsDRNyU \u2014 Police nationale (@PoliceNationale) September 11, 2019\n\nWhile Epstein may be dead, the investigation into his alleged sex ring \u2014 the powerful figures around the world who allegedly helped sustain it \u2014 is just getting started.\n\nStay in touch.
