They were dropped by prosecutors in 2009, shortly before Zuma became president, and reinstated in 2016.\n\n6039190544001\n\nHe is alleged to have taken the bribes during his time as a provincial economy minister and later as deputy president of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in the 1990s.\n\nZuma was forced to resign from office last year over a separate corruption scandal.\n\nCorruption crackdown\n\nHis successor as president and head of the African National Congress (ANC) party, Cyril Ramaphosa, has promised to root out corruption as part of a sweeping reform agenda aimed at restoring faith in South Africa's government and the country's dominant political movement.\n\nThe ANC won re-election earlier this month, scooping 57.5 percent of the vote to guarantee a sixth straight term in power.\n\nBut the result was the worst-ever electoral performance by the party, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid 25 years ago, reflecting widespread frustration over rampant corruption and a stagnant jobs market.\n\nSouth Africa's economy, the second-largest on the continent, grew just 0.8 percent in 2018.\n\nOverall unemployment hovers at about 27 percent with more than 50 percent of young people out of work.\n\nRamaphosa has, so far, faced resistance to his reform agenda, especially from Zuma allies who still occupy several high-ranking positions in the party and the government.", "description": "Zuma expected to return to court next week on corruption charges as court dismissed his application to halt case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/21e9de83b79e47448bb77cb5ef7cdecc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
