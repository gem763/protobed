The official offered no explanation of the grounds on which the State Department was blocking Sondland\u2019s appearance at the last minute.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fully prepared to testify and disappointed,\u201d Luskin said in a telephone interview Tuesday.\n\nSondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, played a central role in the events surrounding President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine and the withholding of military aid to that country, events that kicked off the impeachment inquiry in the House. Democrats consider his testimony and supporting documents crucial to their probe.\n\nThe blocking of Sondland\u2019s testimony was immediately denounced by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, who said members had returned to Washington in the middle of a recess to hear his scheduled closed-door testimony.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance\u201d of Sondland\u2019s testimony as well other State Department officials, said Schiff in a hastily called meeting with reporters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the functioning of a co-equal branch of government.\u201d\n\nLuskin confirmed that Sondland has already turned over to the State Department What\u2019s App messages, text messages and other documents in his possession relevant to the House investigation.\n\nWhile those messages were on Sondland\u2019s personal devices and platforms, they are covered by laws governing official government records, and therefore decisions about releasing them belong to the State Department, not his client, Luskin said.\n\nThe decision to block Sondland from testifying heightens the conflict between the Trump administration and the House committees over the impeachment inquiry. In text messages released last week, Sondland was party to key exchanges on whether the White House was withholding the military aid package for Ukraine as part of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d deal in exchange for a Ukrainian investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and the allegation circulating in right-wing media that Ukraine, rather than Russia, sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d U.S. Ambassador Bill Taylor wrote in a text message to Sondland at 12:47 a.m. on Sept. 9.\n\nAfter a 4 1/2-hour delay, Sondland replied: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intensions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nHe then added: \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nHouse investigators intended to grill Sondland \u2014 a hotel magnate whose companies funneled $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee \u2014 about what happened during the 4 1/2-hour delay and what communications he had with President Trump and other administration officials about the topic.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The State Department waited until 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday to tell U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to show up for his scheduled deposition with three House committees later that morning, the ambassador\u2019s lawyer told Yahoo News.", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sj6Pbw937LLaoVqeZT1Dzg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6dd0a350-e9d0-11e9-8bbf-a3582b9a315a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
