The bulk of the charges were made up of a \u00a3103,378 fee for the suspension of parking bays, a sum that had risen from \u00a329,304 in 2017 to \u00a344,526 this summer.\n\nIt is understood the council charges fees for events it classes as \u201cparades\u201d, but does not for political marches. Campaign groups have argued that Pride is a protest not a party, and have criticised organisers for allowing the event to lose its political message and become too commercialised.\n\nMore than 230 businesses took part in this year\u2019s parade, compared with 217 charities and just 37 community groups. This year\u2019s sponsors included Tesco, Amazon, Barclays and Facebook.\n\nThe human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: \u201cWestminster council exploits Pride as a cash cow. It slaps the organisers with charges that are not applied to NHS, anti-austerity and people\u2019s vote marches. Why the double standards?\u201d\n\nTatchell, one of the organisers of the UK\u2019s first Pride parade in 1972, said the parking charges were \u201cparticularly outrageous\u201d. \u201cThese parking charges were hiked by 51% in 2019, rocketing from \u00a329,548 in 2018 to \u00a344,526 this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see no reason for the sudden huge rise in charges other than what looks like Westminster\u2019s attempt to milk Pride dry.\u201d\n\nThe figures, which were released following a freedom of information request, show that when the costs of council officer time and cleaning for the parade route are taken into account, Pride had a net cost to the council of \u00a3165,664 over the past three years.\n\nCouncillor Ian Adams said the amount of money the council spent on Pride had increased by more than 60% since 2017, from \u00a342,824 in 2017 to \u00a370,956 this year. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud to be able to host one of the largest annual LGBT+ celebrations in the world, right in the heart of Westminster,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with Pride in London every year, heavily subsidising events over the weekend and only recovering a portion of costs towards the significant work that goes into running a fun, safe, and successful Pride.\u201d\n\nAlison Camps, the co-chair of Pride in London, said organisers worked with the council to make the event a success, \u201cfrom street trading licences and park hire, through to the thorough clean-up operation afterwards\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe council waives a number of costs each year, which we appreciate, meaning Pride has to pay around half of the total fees,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs one of London\u2019s largest annual events, we work with all of our partners to make sure we meet our budgets and get the best possible value for money. The savings we make go towards improving the event and making Pride a safe, fun and accessible space for all to enjoy.\u201d\n\nNotting Hill carnival, which also attracts more than a million people every August, is given a yearly grant of \u00a3175,000 by Kensington and Chelsea council. The local authority said it spent more than \u00a3700,000 on the event annually.", "description": "Figures reveal organisers charged more than \u00a3150,000 in three years because it is not classed as a political march", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ce3b3569053c62100adbd4c94940ff29736329/0_120_4856_2913/master/4856.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3859fb219b58af2c2dcb801c72135f5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
