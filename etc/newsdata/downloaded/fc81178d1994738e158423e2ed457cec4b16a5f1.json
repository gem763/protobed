It also put out a warning to seafarers around Taiwan.\n\nAbout 12,000 soldiers were on standby amid fears of floods and storm surge.\n\n\u201cThe national army and authorities are on all out alert. Friends in the affected areas please make preparations for the typhoon and stay indoor as much as possible,\u201d President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on Facebook.\n\nMore than 150 flights and ferry services were cancelled, while several highways across the island were shut amid fears of landslides and floods. The storm cut power to about 2,700 houses on Monday morning.\n\nAfter passing over Taiwan, the typhoon was expected to approach China\u2019s eastern city of Shanghai on Tuesday, forecasts showed.\n\nChinese state media said the storm was likely to make landfall in the eastern province of Zhejiang on Tuesday afternoon, or closely skirt its coastline, bringing heavy rain to both Zhejiang and neighbouring Fujian provinces.\n\nThe government has ordered provincial authorities to make preparations for the typhoon, especially in areas prone to landslides, the official China News Agency reported. Both provinces are very mountainous.\n\nThe timing is particularly bad for China as Tuesday marks the start of the week-long National Day holiday, one of China\u2019s two \u201cgolden week\u201d vacations, when tourist spots around the country heave with visitors.", "description": "Taiwan shut down its financial markets and ordered schools closed on Monday as a typhoon approached its northeastern coast, while airlines cancelled more than 150 flights amid warnings of floods and high winds.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
