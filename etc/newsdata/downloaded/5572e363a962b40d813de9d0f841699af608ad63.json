(AP) - Auburn starting tailback JaTarvious Whitlow sustained a knee injury in the Tigers\u2019 loss to Florida.\n\nTigers coach Gus Malzahn says Whitlow had a procedure on Tuesday and is expected to miss four to six weeks.\n\nWhitlow has rushed for 544 yards and seven touchdowns for the 12th-ranked Tigers, the second-highest total in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nAuburn has an open date this week after the 24-13 loss to No. 7 Florida.\n\nWhitlow could return in time to play against No. 3 Georgia on Nov. 16.\n\nHis absence will likely lead to increased roles for Kam Martin and Shaun Shivers. Martin has run for 174 yards and Shivers has gained 144.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Auburn starting tailback JaTarvious Whitlow sustained a knee injury in the Tigers' loss to Florida.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/auburn_florida_football_53138_c0-159-3808-2379_s1770x1032.jpg?9733f327f65f7f812370377d6c1c8229719bd859", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
