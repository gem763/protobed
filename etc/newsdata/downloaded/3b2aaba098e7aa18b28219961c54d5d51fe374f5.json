Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.\n\nOn Friday night hundreds of demonstrators, many masked and dressed in black, attacked MTR metro stations in the Mong Kok district, targeted because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a metro train on Aug. 31 as they cowered on the floor.", "description": "Police checked for tickets and passports to allow only airline passengers through to the Hong Kong airport to avoid the chaos of last weekend's protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106117452-1567867852317rts2pjm9.jpg?v=1567867993", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
