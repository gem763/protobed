One happened in the afternoon on September 28, the other late at night on October 16. This dude is leaving audio records of his private conversations inadvertently in journalists\u2019 mailboxes at a moment when he could conceivably bring down a president and/or land himself in prison.\n\nWhich raises the question: How many other reporters are sitting on voicemails of Rudy\u2019s butt-dials (no pun intended)? It can\u2019t have happened twice to one guy at NBC News and to no one else in the Washington press corps. It\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s become an industry rite of passage now. You\u2019re nobody in political journalism until Time\u2019s 2001 Man of the Year has left you an accidental message in which he\u2019s heard rambling about Hunter Biden and needing several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to read all of this to get the full flavor as I can only excerpt so much. The good news is that there\u2019s no clear evidence of a crime in the transcript, or something even more disastrous like Rudy admitting that the CrowdStrike stuff is kooky nonsense that they\u2019re feeding to the Fox News audience. It\u2019s mostly just him rambling about stuff that sounds crime-y \u2014 unknown business he has in Bahrain and Turkey\n\nThe bad news is that the writers of the \u201cPresident Trump\u201d reality show we now inhabit have apparently decided to take the show in a more comic direction.\n\n\u201cIs Robert around?\u201d Giuliani asks. \u201cHe\u2019s in Turkey,\u201d the man responds. Giuliani replies instantly. \u201cThe problem is we need some money.\u201d The two men then go silent. Nine seconds pass. No word is spoken. Then Giuliani chimes in again. \u201cWe need a few hundred thousand,\u201d he says. It\u2019s unclear what the two men were talking about. But Giuliani is known to have worked closely with a Robert who has ties to Turkey. His name is Robert Mangas, and he\u2019s a lawyer at the firm Greenberg Traurig LLP, as well as a registered agent of the Turkish government. Giuliani himself was employed by Greenberg Traurig until about May 2018. Mangas\u2019 name appears in court documents related to the case of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish gold trader charged in the United States with laundering Iranian money in a scheme to evade American sanctions.\n\nZarrab is the same person whom Rudy reportedly lobbied Trump and Rex Tillerson about in 2017, trying to get him released as part of a prisoner swap with Turkey, which Tillerson recognized instantly as improper.\n\nGod only knows what he needs a few hundred thousand for now and how \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 or Turkey \u2014 might fit into it. Maybe we\u2019ll find out from the DOJ in a few months. Although their plate is already pretty full with Rudy stuff:\n\nThe scrutiny isn\u2019t coming just from the previously known probes by FBI agents and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office based out of Manhattan, according to two people familiar with the investigation. The criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington has taken an interest in the former New York mayor, too, meaning an expansion of resources that indicates the politically sensitive probe into the president\u2019s personal attorney is both broader and moving at a faster pace than previously understood\u2026 \u201cHe appears to be a subject, if not a target of an active investigation. So to have him be a part of the legal team would be troublesome to say the least,\u201d said Greg Brower, who served as the FBI\u2019s top liaison to Congress until 2018. \u201cAt best, it\u2019s a messy situation and more likely it\u2019s just completely dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyer is now shopping around for his own lawyer, and it\u2019s unclear at the moment what sort of legal responsibilities he may still have towards Trump. Politico notes that he wasn\u2019t included in the latest strategy session held by Trump\u2019s legal team on impeachment and he hasn\u2019t been on television much lately to plead Trump\u2019s case. Republicans on the Hill have complained loudly and often about him, in particular his wild ranting during TV interviews, which you would think might be all the encouragement Trump needs to toss Rudy under the bus.\n\nThe problem is, Rudy knows things. He was the point man on the president\u2019s irregular diplomacy towards Ukraine about the Biden and CrowdStrike matters and he may be privy to God knows what other damaging information about Trump. He could potentially do tremendous damage to the president as an enemy. So Trump has been nothing but complimentary towards him, including as recently as this morning, saying, \u201cI think Rudy is a great gentleman\u2026 He\u2019s been a great crime fighter. He looks for corruption wherever he goes.\u201d\n\nWhich, technically, does appear to be true. Rudy does look for corruption wherever he goes.\n\nAnyway, it may be that the weirder Giuliani gets on TV and the more undisciplined he becomes in butt-dialing reporters, paradoxically the more tightly Trump needs to cling to him. The only thing more dangerous than turning your back on a confidant who knows your secrets is turning your back on a confidant who knows your secrets and who\u2019s behaving erratically. Give him any reason to believe he\u2019s being abandoned and who knows what he\u2019ll do? If Rudy were to end up in front of a House committee in a hostile mood towards Trump, he really could say things that would leave Senate Republicans with little choice but to vote to remove.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, I think, the Trump/Giuliani saga can only end with a pardon, probably sooner than everyone expects. That would be risky insofar as a pardon would also eliminate Rudy\u2019s right to refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, but from Trump\u2019s standpoint it\u2019s better to have Giuliani forced to speak feeling that he owes you than Giuliani potentially willing to speak while bearing you a grudge.
