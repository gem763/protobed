This followed the return of remains of an Israeli soldier killed in battle in Lebanon in 1982 with help from Russia. The country couldn\u2019t restrain its excitement at the repatriation of Zachary Baumol\u2019s remains. Prayers were that Eli Cohen would be next.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, Eli Cohen was a larger than life hero. Had his story ended differently we might never have known how much Israel is indebted to him. As one of Israel\u2019s most famous Mossad agents, Cohen breached the highest level of Syrian political and military leadership assuming the identity of Syrian businessman Kamal Amin Ta\u2019abet.\n\nUnder this alias, from 1961 until his exposure and execution in 1965, Cohen provided considerable details on the highest level of Syrian political and military matters. He breached Syria\u2019s elite to such an extent that not only was he privy to high level secrets, but was even in consideration to be named the Syrian Deputy Minister of Defense.\n\nEli Cohen\u2019s life and legend is recounted in a book, Our Man in Damascus, and movie by the same name. Now, Eli Cohen\u2019s story is being told in the new Netflix series, \u201cThe Spy.\u201d Spoiler alert, despite the drama of his life and alias, and the incredible achievements that are credited to Cohen, after he was caught, both the embarrassment and damage were so high, Cohen\u2019s execution was done publicly and broadcast on Syrian TV.\n\nWhat were some of Cohen\u2019s achievements that were so embarrassing to the Syrians? As one of, if not the only, civilians to receive private tours of military installations, including in the then Syrian controlled Golan Heights, the intelligence Cohen was able to deliver to Israel was unparalleled.\n\nCohen provided details of Syria\u2019s plan to block the tributaries that provided fresh water to the Sea of Galilee and Jordan River, and about military outposts through the Golan, including tank traps which helped Israel map out its eventual capture of the Golan in 1967. Most dramatic, and still evident today, Cohen\u2019s ingenuity made that task even easier. During one of his visits to the Golan, overlooking Israeli communities from the commanding strategic position above, he expressed concern for the well being of Syrian troops who had no shade on the barren mountainous terrain.\n\nCohen suggested that the Syrians plant trees on the Golan near their fortifications and foxholes. With the trees as literal landmarks, Israel knew exactly where the Syrian troops and weapons were. In the 1967 Six Day War, two years after his death, when Israel launched a preemptive attack on the Syrian positions, both the intelligence Cohen provided, and the location of the trees enabled Israel to capture the Golan Heights in just two days. The trees still provide shelter and shade today over remains of former Syrian bunkers and positions, as if still under Cohen\u2019s watchful eye.\n\nWhat will become of the remains of what was once Syria under a hereditary Alawite Assad dictatorship remains to be seen after a decade-long multi front civil war. Earlier this year, US policy recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty of the Golan, as if there were an alternative or any rational ability to ever give Syria or any other Arab or Islamic regime that literal commanding and threatening position over Israeli communities in the Galilee. The fact that Israeli communities and the Druze minority now thrive peacefully throughout the Golan and northern Galilee is part of Eli Cohen\u2019s legacy. The land is lush and home to many outstanding Israeli vineyards, orchards, a center of tourism and coexistence between Jews and Arabs, and even Israel\u2019s only ski resort.\n\nI think of Eli Cohen often. First, I travel a lot and my kids sometimes joke that my \u201cwork\u201d is my cover as a Mossad agent. While that\u2019s not true, and even if it were true I\u2019d deny it, I think of Cohen\u2019s sacrifice often, much more than \u201cjust\u201d giving his life. For weeks or months on end, before any electronic communication that would allow him to stay in touch, Cohen left his wife and kids for his \u201cjob\u201d of spying on Syria. He missed his children growing up and ultimately paid with his life. Knowing that their father is a hero may be some comfort, but it\u2019s no replacement from not having their father to read to them, tuck them into bed, or be with them throughout their lives. In a word, Eli Cohen was selfless.\n\nI hope Netflix portrays this with credibility and without moral equivalence. Cohen was heroic. He sacrificed his life for the sake of Israel, and his fellow Jews. And he did so while breaching the highest levels of one Arab state that was, and remains, a threat to Israel and its citizens, especially with the advent in recent years of growing Iranian influence and its physical and military presence.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Eli Cohen\u2019s remains will be brought home to Israel. It\u2019s unclear if recent visibility will increase that possibility, or make it an even more distant dream. One thing is that Cohen has never been forgotten by his grateful country. In July 2018, it was announced that Eli Cohen\u2019s watch has been recovered from Syria which was presented by Mossad Director, Yossi Cohen, to Eli Cohen\u2019s family. Clearly, this glimmer of hope indicated that no matter how much time has passed, Israel had never given up on repatriating Cohen\u2019s remains.\n\nThe same way Cohen led a secretive operation in Syria for years, so too Israel spent no shortage of time and resources to bring home one of its top spies. If Israel owes Eli Cohen and his family anything, this is the least we can continue to strive for, and underscores the Jewish values of honoring the dead no matter where they are or how much time has passed.", "description": "A few months ago, there was a slew of hopeful .09/09/2019 2:48:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Jonathan Feldstein", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/300/bbd26028-9f31-447e-b52d-4a45564561a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
