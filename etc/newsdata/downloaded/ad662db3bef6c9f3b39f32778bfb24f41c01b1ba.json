Posts", "language": "en", "text": "President of the United Nations General Assembly Maria Fernanda Espinosa, left, and Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla met in Havana in April.\n\nThe Trump administration moved to expel a pair of Cuban diplomats from their posts at the country\u2019s mission to the United Nations, alleging they attempted to conduct \u201cinfluence operations\u201d against the U.S. ahead of next week\u2019s gathering of world leaders in New York.\n\nThe Cuban mission to the U.N. didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The State Department didn\u2019t elaborate on the alleged offenses or the timing of the diplomats\u2019 departure.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Thursday the U.S. requires the immediate departure of the two diplomats, whom she accused of \u201cabusing their privileges of residence.\u201d\n\nMs. Ortagus said the U.S. would continue to investigate potential wrongdoing at the Cuban mission, and that its remaining diplomats would see their travel essentially restricted to the island of Manhattan, where the U.N. is based. A separate State Department spokesman said it wasn\u2019t \u201cpermissible for individuals to use their diplomatic positions as cover for engaging in activities that ...are prejudicial to the national security of the United States.\u201d The U.N. General Assembly session ramps up next week with addresses from President Trump and other leaders. The Trump administration has reversed the diplomatic opening to Cuba engineered by President Obama and imposed new sanctions. In recent months, the U.S. has banned cruise ship travel to Cuba and limited the amount of money that Cuban Americans can send to their relatives on the island. Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have repeatedly accused Cuba of exacerbating the political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, where authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro clings to power despite U.S. and international support for opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. There is recent precedent for the U.S. removal of foreign diplomats. In March 2018, the Trump administration said it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in London, which British and American officials said was carried out by Moscow\u2019s agents. Among the 60 were 12 Russians serving at the U.N. in New York whom U.S. officials said were intelligence officers. \u2014Warren P. Strobel contributed to this article.
