The great news is the broad market rallied without Technology, which was weighed down by semiconductors under pressure from that big miss at Texas Instrument (TXN). I like that last little push for the broad market into the close when investors could have easily given up the ghost and moved to the sidelines to await the next tranche of earnings. It wasn\u2019t the size of the gain that impressed, but the fact the market\u2019s directional bias has shifted back to the upside; although, it needs a big punch to establish new all-time milestones.\n\nMomentum investors got their fix in Communication Service stocks, which powered higher, even as Mark Zuckerberg was getting grilled and not looking too confident on Capitol Hill.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.28% Communication Services (XLC) +0.78% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) -0.46% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.46% Energy (XLE) +0.83% Financials (XLF) +0.42% Health Care (XLV) +0.62% Industrials (XLI) -0.01% Materials (XLB) +0.63% Real Estate (XLRE) +0.17% Technology (XLK) +0.09% Utilities (XLU) +0.40%\n\nBamBam Stocks\n\nA few names that have been targeted by shorts, and short campaigns are set to turn the table today and hit back at those that bet and, in many cases, attempted to manipulate their shares lower. I\u2019m just going to call them BamBam stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nElon Musk tried to tell everyone, but nobody would listen. It was the quarter the man, which some call a modern-day PT Barnum, has been promising. The company earned $342 million, while the street modeled them losing $257 million. Ouch. The company is ahead of schedule on its Model Y and Shanghai Giga factory. Moreover, Musk says the company will reach 360,000 in sales for 2019, which means they must deliver 105,000 this quarter.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nJust keeps churning out impressive numbers, which is why the street initially greeted another great quarter with a collective yawn.\n\nRevenue $33.1 billon consensus $32.15 billion\n\nEarnings $1.38 consensus $1.25\n\nCloud revenue came in at $10.8 billion, beating consensus of $10.4 billion.\n\nLam Research (LRCX)\n\nConsidered a better proxy for the trade war than Texas Instruments, which laid an egg on Tuesday night.\n\nGlobal Markets\n\nChina 27%\n\nKorea 21%\n\nTaiwan 18%\n\nJapan 13%\n\nSE Asia 10%\n\nUS 8%\n\nEurope 3%\n\nThe stock popped in strong guidance of $2.5 billion in revenue and earnings in the $3.60 to $4.00 range.\n\nEdward Life science (EW)\n\nPosted a perfect quarter, as sales climbed 21%. Management didn\u2019t skimp on research and development, which also increased 21%, and was 18% of total revenue. In addition, management hiked its earnings guidance.\n\nThe stock looks to open at an all-time high.\n\nAlign (ALGN)\n\nPosted record revenue $607.3 million +20.2%\n\nVolume +20.7%\n\nTeens Volume +31%\n\nPayPal (PYPL)\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV) $179 billion from $143 billion, estimate $177.4 billion\n\nVenmo $27.0 billion volume\n\n9.8 million net new active accounts\n\nCrossed 1 billion transactions first time\n\nNote: company is first foreign firm to get domestic license for payments in China\n\nWe'll see how the call goes, but I think the stock rallies back to $121 this year, and longer term, it could go exponentially higher.\n\nThe Almighty American Consumer\n\nI\u2019m sure I was the only person in the financial media to mention Lithia Motors (LAD) yesterday, which is a shame. For one thing, it was the best proxy for the American consumer to post financial results.\n\nIts 265 on the Fortune 500 list\n\nThird largest dealership group\n\n82% national coverage\n\n186 centers\n\n15,000 employees\n\nThe company posted the highest revenue quarter in its history.\n\nSame store sales +7.6%\n\nSame store new autos +4.0%\n\nSame store used autos +14.0%\n\nSame store service & parts +9.5%\n\nGross profits $3,631 +3,1%\n\nThe results from Lithia underscore the strength of the American consumer but also refutes the notion US auto sales were falling off a cliff, although stories of \u201cpeak auto\u201d go back five years.\n\nAfter the close, Ford (F) posted results that beat on the bottom line, but the company has issues that are mostly company-specific issues.\n\nGlobal market share 6.0% from 6.5%\n\nNorth America 12.6% -0.7\n\nSouth America 7.1% -1.3\n\nChina 2.3% -0.6\n\nFord shares might struggle a bit, but it\u2019s not the proxy for the consumer, or even autos, in part because of its stumble rolling out its latest Explorer.\n\nPortfolio Approach", "description": "It was a seesaw session where buyers showed up on .10/25/2019 19:50:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/297/64cb8483-99e0-409b-b788-5e65c6c6da33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
