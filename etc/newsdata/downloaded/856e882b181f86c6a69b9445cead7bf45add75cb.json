CTVIX is categorized as an All Cap Value fund, and like the name suggests, invests across the cap spectrum in small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap companies. With a five year after-expenses return of -3.48%, you're mostly paying more in fees than returns.\n\nBrookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Y (BGLYX): 1.1% expense ratio, 0.85% management fee. BGLYX is a Global - Equity mutual fund investing in bigger markets like the U.S., Europe, and Japan; these kinds of funds aren't limited by geography. This fund has an annual returns of 0.52% over the last five years. Another fund guilty of having investors pay more in fees than returns.\n\nThird Avenue Real Estate Value Investor (TVRVX) - 1.4% expense ratio, 0.9% management fee. TVRVX is categorized as a Sector - Real Estate mutual fund, which typically invests in various real estate investment trusts (REIT) due to their taxation rules.

Ouch!\n\n3 Top Ranked Mutual Funds\n\nNow that we've covered our \"worst offender\" list, let's take a look at some of Zacks' highest ranked mutual funds with some of the lowest fees you may want to consider.\n\nEaton Vance Atlanta Capital Select Equity A (ESEAX) is a fund that has an expense ratio of 1.05%, and a management fee of 0.7%. ESEAX is a Large Cap Value mutual fund, which invests in stocks with a market cap of $10 billion of more, but whose share prices do not reflect their intrinsic value. With yearly returns of 11.02% over the last five years, this fund clearly wins.\n\nCity Natural Rochdale US Core Equity & Income Institutional (CNRUX) is a stand out fund. CNRUX is a Large Cap Growth option; these mutual funds purchase stakes in numerous large U.S. companies that are expected to develop and grow at a faster rate than other large-cap stocks. With five-year annualized performance of 11.5% and expense ratio of 0.54%, this diversified fund is an attractive buy with a strong history of performance.\n\nAQR Large Cap Defensive Style N (AUENX): Expense ratio: 0.65%. Management fee: 0.25%. AUENX is part of the Large Cap Blend section, and these mutual funds most often invest in firms with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. By investing in bigger companies, these funds offer more stability, and are often well-suited for investors with a \"buy and hold\" mindset. AUENX has produced a 13.17% over the last five years.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThese examples underscore the huge range in quality of mutual funds - from the really bad to the astonishingly good.
