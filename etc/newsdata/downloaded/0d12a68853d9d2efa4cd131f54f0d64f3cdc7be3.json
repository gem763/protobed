Rising U.S. payrolls and the lowest unemployment rate in five decades undercut prospects of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cThe relative strength of the jobs report throws cold water on concept that the Fed will cut rates,\u201d said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.\n\nOil has been under pressure all week from a series of gloomy U.S. economic data. A key measure of American service-industry activity dropped to the lowest in three years, while an employment gauge registered its weakest reading in more than five years.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate for November delivery rose 36 cents to settle at $52.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nfor December delivery increased 66 cents to settle at $58.37 on the ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe Exchange. It traded at a $5.63 premium to WTI for the same month.\n\nSigns of economic deterioration in the U.S., China and Germany are worsening an already fragile consumption outlook for fuels. OPEC member Nigeria warned Thursday that oil demand will be \u201cvery challenging\u201d next year. Those concerns, combined with quick repairs at damaged Saudi Arabian oil installations, have evaporated oil\u2019s gains following the Sept. 14 bombardment of the kingdom.\n\n\u201cOil markets are focusing on severe macro risks, but are also shrugging off the most heightened geopolitical risk in years,\u201d Ed Morse, an analyst at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: )., wrote in a report. \u201cAs markets shed just about any consideration of supply risk, attention stays focused on what is nearly universally expected to be a significantly weaker year of demand growth.\u201d\n\nWashington and Beijing are set to restart high-level trade negotiations next week, but the chances of a short-term breakthrough don\u2019t appear to be high. Meanwhile, the U.S. imposed tariffs on European goods including aircraft and dairy products this week.\n\nDrilling rigs targeting crude in U.S. fields fell by three to 710 last week, the lowest since May 2017, Baker Hughes reported Friday.", "description": "Oil Records Biggest Weekly Drop Since July on Demand Pessimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3377b19f1deb660ed23408b451284195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
