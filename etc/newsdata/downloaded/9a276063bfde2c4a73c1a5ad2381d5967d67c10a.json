Divers continue to search for one person who is still missing.\n\nThe Santa Barbara county sheriff, Bill Brown, said the department would release additional names as authorities reached victims\u2019 next of kin.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still unknown and will be a focus of investigation in the weeks ahead. But details that emerged since 2 September, when the ship caught fire, paint a harrowing picture of fire erupting as passengers slept below deck, trapping them in an inferno. Brown said Friday that early forensic analysis indicated victims had died before suffering burns, suggesting death by smoke inhalation.\n\nFive crew members escaped the blaze and found help from a nearby \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d ship.\n\nThe US coast guard has said the Conception, as the diving boat was named, had passed all recent safety inspections. But in the days since the blaze, inspectors have questioned the safety of the boat\u2019s layout and practices.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The derrick barge Salta Verde engaged in salvage operations over the wreck of the dive boat Conception at Santa Cruz Island on Friday.

We couldn\u2019t turn the light on.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeither did the ship designate a \u201croving watchman\u201d to keep watch while passengers slept.\n\n\n\nEfforts are under way to salvage the wreckage, whose remains may offer additional clues to the cause of the fire, but high winds may pose a challenge. Multiple local and federal bodies are involved in the investigation, including the coast guard and the FBI.\n\nThe owners of Truth Aquatics Inc, which owned the Conception, on Thursday filed a petition in federal court in an effort to head off future lawsuits. Attorneys representing the owners cite in the petition the Shipowner\u2019s Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, a 19th-century statute that would eliminate owners\u2019 financial liability or lower it to the current value of the charred boat.\n\nPlay Video 1:05 California boat fire kills at least 25 people \u2013 video report\n\nThey claim in the lawsuit the boat is now worthless. The law was successfully employed after the Titanic sank in 1912.\n\nThe Philadelphia-based maritime attorney Robert J Mongeluzzi told the Los Angeles Times the legal move was predictable, if callous.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pretty heartless, when not all the bodies have been recovered, to file something saying their lives are worthless,\u201d Mongeluzzi said.\n\n\n\nThe victims identified this week range in age from 25 to 62.
