While the MNR report does not mention a military application, the ministry has been known to work closely with the People's Liberation Army Navy, and there are certain strategic advantages to increased maritime domain awareness.\n\nChina claims the vast majority of the South China Sea, a contested waterway also claimed by a number of countries in the region that have, in some cases with the support of the US and others outside the region, pushed back on Chinese assertions of sovereignty.\n\nChina has built outposts across the area and fielded various weapons systems to strengthen its position. At the same time, it has bolstered its surveillance capabilities.\n\n\"The drones have obvious use to improve awareness both of what is on the sea and what is in the air,\" Peter Dutton, a retired US Navy officer and a professor at the US Naval War College, wrote on Twitter.\n\nGreg Poling, a South China Sea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained that Chinese surveillance upgrades could help China should it decide to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone in the region, something Dutton suggested as well.\n\nChina is also developing the Hainan satellite constellation, which will be able to provide real-time monitoring of the South China Sea with the help of two hyperspectral satellites, two radar satellites, and six optical satellites. The constellation should be completed in two years, according to the South China Morning Post.", "description": "China is fielding a new far-reaching, drone surveillance network that will give China and improved ability to spy on the South China Sea.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d793c702e22af0fe04f4522-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
