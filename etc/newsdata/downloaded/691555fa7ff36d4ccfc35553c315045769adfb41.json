Macy are sharing new details on their role in the sweeping U.S. college admissions bribery scam, revealing that their eldest daughter was traumatized by the sight of federal agents showing up at their home earlier this year.\n\nIn letters obtained by the Los Angeles Times and published Sunday, the couple wrote about the scandal to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who will deliver Huffman\u2019s sentence next week.\n\nAccording to Macy, 19-year-old Sophia Grace \u201chas nightmares from the FBI agents waking her that morning with guns\u201d when Huffman was taken away in handcuffs in March. Huffman later pleaded guilty to shelling out $15,000 to rig her daughter\u2019s SAT scores.\n\nTwo days after Huffman\u2019s arrest, her daughter\u2019s audition to an unnamed college was suddenly canceled via email.\n\n\u201cShe called us from the airport in hysterics, begging us to, \u2018Do something, please, do something,\u2019\u201d Macy recalled.\n\nIn her own letter, Huffman said she had convinced herself that the bribery was a necessary crime to ensure her child\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother, I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star said. \u201cI see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair.\u201d\n\nIn a searing memo filed Friday and also obtained by the Times, prosecutors dismissed any notion that the actions of Huffman and the dozens of others allegedly involved were simply parental concern gone awry. Others charged in the scam include \u201cFull House\u201d actor Lori Loughlin and fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who both pleaded not guilty in April.\n\n\u201cAll parents want to help their kids get ahead, yet most manage to steer clear of conspiracy, bribery and fraud,\u201d they said.\n\nProsecutors are recommending a one-month jail sentence for Huffman, in addition to a $20,000 fine and one year\u2019s probation, according to CBS News.", "description": "The \"Desperate Housewives\" star and husband William H.
