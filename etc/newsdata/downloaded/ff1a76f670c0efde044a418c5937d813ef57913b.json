However, it is unlikely that the mass protests conducted by pro-independence Hong Kongers will stop any time soon. The anti-communist demonstrators have a list of five demands they say must be met by the city-state's government.\n\n\"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had said many times the extradition bill was as good as dead and that other demands, including universal suffrage and an amnesty for all those charged with rioting, were beyond her control,\" according to Reuters.\n\n\"There aren\u2019t any big differences between suspension and withdrawal of the extradition bill... It\u2019s too little, too late,\" a 27-year-old protester named Connie told The Independent. \"There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have been raging all summer and have sparked international outcry. As seen in the video below, these demonstrations have largely been a pan-generational protest, meaning youth and elder Hong Kongers largely support the fight for freedom.\n\nUncle Wong is 82 years old, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from trying to protect protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t fear death.
