Only 9% of passes were played long in the 2019 tournament while 61% of all ball-regains occurred within seven seconds.\n\n\u201cThis was the most fluid women\u2019s World Cup of all time as players showed a great ability to read the game and perform the right movements with and without the ball,\u201d TSG head April Heinrichs said.\n\nHeinrichs added that better coaching analysis and the use of technology had helped coaches give immediate and detailed feedback to players, thereby improving their performance.\n\n\u201cOf course, we need to credit the coaches for the team\u2019s preparations. All in all, this is the result of teams playing more friendlies and shows the positive impact of under-20 and under-17 competitions,\u201d Heinrichs said.", "description": "FIFA's Technical Study Group (TSG) hailed this year's women's World Cup in France as the best-ever in the competition's history, with the tournament showcasing the tactical, technical and physical improvements in the women's game.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432613479&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0CD", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
