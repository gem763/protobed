That Might Change.", "language": "en", "text": "Nicole Morio works for the Social Security Administration, helping Americans navigate their way to a financially secure retirement. Yet her own financial situation is anything but secure.\n\nThe 36-year-old had a baby four weeks ago. And the federal government doesn\u2019t offer its more than 2 million workers paid leave after the birth of a child.\n\nMorio said she can barely pay the rent on the apartment she shares with her husband, who is a self-employed commercial cleaner, in Staten Island, New York, where they\u2019re raising three kids under the age of 4. They are behind on the electric and gas bills, and she isn\u2019t making her student loan payments, Morio said.\n\nThere\u2019s this notion out there that federal workers get great benefits, but that\u2019s just not true, Morio said. \u201cWe\u2019re not covered the way people think we are. I am being forced to choose between taking care of my family or paying the rent.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a chance things could change.\n\nA proposal to give federal employees 12 weeks of paid time off to care for a baby or ailing family member or to deal with a personal health issue, the Federal Employees Paid Leave Act, might actually make it into law. The move would be a huge step forward for the largest employer in the U.S.\n\nThe provision was passed as part of a defense spending bill in the House of Representatives this summer. The Senate then passed a version of the bill that didn\u2019t include the provision.\n\nHowever, there are signs that it\u2019ll still wind up in the bill\u2019s final version, which should emerge from the reconciliation process shortly after Congress comes back from recess.\n\nLast week, the Senate voted on a nonbinding provision (called a motion to instruct) in support of adding paid leave for federal workers into the final version of the bill. It was technically voted down, 47-48. However, four key Democratic supporters missed the vote because they were out campaigning for the 2020 presidential nomination: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.). They all support the resolution.\n\nMore surprising: four Republican senators voted in favor of the resolution: Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Shelly Capito (W.Va.).\n\nIn other words, a majority of senators actually support paid leave for federal workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really huge step,\u201d said Michelle McGrain, a federal affairs manager at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cThe fact that this was even brought up for a vote and four Republicans felt it was untenable to vote against paid leave really shows the environment on this is shifting.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka have both been supportive of paid family leave. A White House official told HuffPost they\u2019re encouraged to see the progress here. The official declined to comment on the recent Senate vote because the administration doesn\u2019t comment on motions to instruct.\n\nThe fact that this was even brought up for a vote and four Republicans felt it was untenable to vote against paid leave really shows the environment on this is shifting. Michelle McGrain, the National Partnership for Women & Families\n\nGiving federal workers paid time off \u2015 to care not only for newborn children but also for sick family members \u2015 would be a potential game-changer for the U.S., which is the only developed country in the world that does not guarantee paid time off for new mothers. The move could pave the way for a nationwide policy.\n\n\u201cAs the largest employer in the country, the federal government should be leading from the front when it comes to family-friendly policies, and yet parts of the private sector definitely has us beat on paid leave benefits,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), who authored FEPLA 10 years ago.\n\nThe largest private employer in the U.S., Walmart, started offering paid parental leave last year.\n\nThe added benefit could also help the federal government recruit and retain workers, Maloney said.\n\nWomen of childbearing age were 31% more likely to quit federal employment than men of the same age, according to a 2009 report published by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. That study estimated that giving federal workers paid leave would keep 2,650 women from quitting their jobs every year.\n\nGovernment jobs, once considered steady and secure, if a bit lower paying, have lost some of their appeal in recent years thanks to a series of government shutdowns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to hire a lot more people, and we want younger people who can have their entire career here,\u201d said Krystle Kirkpatrick, a 32-year-old customer service representative for the Internal Revenue Service who works near Salt Lake City.\n\nKirkpatrick said she was considering a career in nursing but chose government work because of the benefits \u2015 a consistent schedule, good health insurance, a retirement plan. Paid leave would certainly add to the package. \u201cPaid family leave is a big selling point and a big deal for families,\u201d she said.\n\nKirkpatrick, who has two kids, ages 7 and 13, said she recently had to scrounge together her sick leave to be with her father last year when he had heart surgery. \u201cThings like that are scary,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to just drop everything and go, but you rely on your job and you need your job.\u201d\n\nAmericans do overwhelmingly support paid family leave \u2015 8 in 10 say that mothers should have access to maternity leave, according to one Pew Research Center survey. However, there isn\u2019t as much consensus on how to fund a national policy.\n\nThe Family Act, a bill sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) that would fund paid leave through a small payroll tax, has the backing of most Democrats.\n\nAnd over the past year or so, a few Republicans have come up with their own ideas for policies, which mainly involve borrowing money from other places, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance or tax credits. The Republican proposals typically only cover leave for new parents \u2015 not family leave to care for sick loved ones or your own illness. About 75% of the unpaid leave workers currently access via the Family and Medical Leave Act is in the personal illness category.\n\nFamily leave for federal workers would be funded differently than any of these proposals. The bill passed in the House would pay for the provision by selling unused Department of Defense web addresses and from making some other small adjustments.\n\nAs part of a Defense Department bill, \u201cit\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to a wall or nukes,\u201d said Shilpa Phadke, vice president of the women\u2019s initiative at the Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s a rounding error.\u201d\n\nRight now, federal workers who need leave must cobble together their sick time. For women who work for the government and need maternity leave, it means when they actually do get sick or have a sick child at home, they\u2019re out of sick leave. Morio, the Social Security worker, said she recently came to work with a serious ear infection.\n\nShe is rooting for paid leave to pass.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be political,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s human rights.\u201d", "description": "A majority of senators actually want to give the nation's largest workforce this very crucial benefit", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82ad0b2300001c05571796.jpeg?cache=mrnz5kxqhf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
