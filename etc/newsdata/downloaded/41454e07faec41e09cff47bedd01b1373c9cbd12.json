A better flirt? Less bothered by infidelity? Want to raise teenagers who start having sex later and have less sexual partners?\n\nThese are the countries that can teach us Brits valuable lessons about sex and love.\n\nThere are valuable lessons our EU neighbours can teach us Brits about sex and love. (File photo)\n\nThe best flirt award goes to...Spain\n\nYou were expecting Italy or France, right?\n\nYou're not too far off - they're always up there in the top five - but the country most consistently named as producing the world's most flirtatious people is actually Spain.\n\nIt's not just the men who live up to their reputation as fiery, passionate Latin lovers.\n\nSex expert Tracey Cox (pictured) shares her advice about the lessons we can learn from others\n\nSpanish women were found to be the world's greatest flirts in one major study.\n\nDating website, Badoo.com, ranked 20 countries by the number of contacts with a man initiated by women in each country.\n\nSpanish women topped the table by a comfortable stretch.\n\n(The Brits ranked 14th, by the way, and the US second last.)\n\nUp until the mid-70s, Spanish women couldn't open a bank account without their husband's permission.\n\nNow the proportion of female directors on the boards of major companies is greater than in countries like Belgium.\n\nGone is the traditional, subservient senora, garbed in black. She's been swept aside by feisty modern, independent women like Penelope Cruz.\n\nThe lesson to be learned? It's more than OK for women to make the first move.\n\nThe country most relaxed with nudity- Germany\n\nI can personally vouch for this.\n\nAnyone who's been to Mykonos in Greece has probably heard of Nammos, an exclusive club and restaurant that attracts the rich and the famous.\n\nThere are sunbeds in front that you pay a fortune to lie on, populated by thin, glamorous women in designer swimwear and wealthy Greek yacht owners smoking cigars.\n\nI was there a few years ago and watched, bemused, as an elderly German couple decided the bit of sand most appealing to them was smack bang in the middle of the walkway between these sun beds.\n\nFar from being dissuaded from settling by the outraged from the clientele, they set up camp, got out their flasks of coffee and deckchairs \u2013 and then got naked.\n\nI have never seen anything as funny in my life! Most particularly the incredulous expressions on the club's patrons as the man got up to rummage through their beach bag to find sunscreen for his wife, affording us all a prime view of his bottom and testicles.\n\nNudism is still very popular in Germany and a poll this year by a German holiday site found 60 per cent of Germans think it's perfectly fine to bare your skin. (File pic)\n\nThe staff could do nothing about it because the beach itself is public, even if the bit the sun loungers are on is not.\n\nTheir complete lack of self-consciousness \u2013 being middle-aged and overweight rather than thin and beautiful as well as completely naked \u2013 made me want to get to my feet and pump the air with a 'Yes!'.\n\nEvery German I've told this story to laughs and isn't the slightly bit surprised.\n\nNudism is still very popular in Germany.\n\nIt's known as Freikoerperkultur (FKK): Free Body Culture.\n\nBaring all is normal in saunas, swimming pools, the park and on the beach.\n\nA poll this year by a German holiday site found 60 per cent of Germans think it's perfectly fine for people to be partially or completely nude on the beach and elsewhere.\n\nForty per cent also said they wouldn't care less if their work colleagues decided to show up to work naked.\n\nIt's thought that topless sunbathing, which still continues on most European beaches, started when the West Germans started to holiday in Europe, bringing their permissive attitudes to nudity with them.\n\nWatching that happy German couple, so content in their bodies and their skin, in stark contrast to the slimmer but paranoidly body-conscious crowd in Mykonos, I'm in no doubt as to who got it right.\n\nMost likely to have an affair? It's a draw\n\nWe're led to believe affairs are de rigeur in France.\n\nWe might be right as well: one study found France is the only country in which most people believe affairs are morally acceptable. Only 28 per cent of adulterers say they regret their affairs.\n\nWhen President Hollande was photographed allegedly nipping off on this scooter in the middle of the night to see his mistress, his poll ratings went up not down.\n\nAnother recent study found 43 per cent of French people had affairs \u2013 but France has competition.\n\nWhen it came to the country that was mostl likely to have an affair, one study found France is the only country in which most people believe affairs are morally acceptable. (File photo)\n\nItaly beat them by two per cent. Perhaps not surprising, given the head of the country was Silvio Berlusconi, famous more for his Bunga Bunga parties than his politics.\n\nClearly Italians share the same 'So what?' attitude to playing away as the French: Italy still has one of the lowest divorce rates of any nation despite the high proportion of infidelity.\n\nI'm obviously not advocating the British adopt a 'cheating is fine' philosophy. But there's a reason why psychotherapist Esther Perel's Ted Talk 'Rethinking Infidelity' has millions and millions of hits.\n\nInfidelity isn't as black and white as most people think.\n\nThe all-round winner of everything sexual- Scandinavia\n\nEvery time there's a study that attempts to dislodge the Scandi's from the throne of sexual liberty, it simply reaffirms what's been known all along.\n\nThe Scandinavians get it right, every time, when it comes to sex.\n\nThere's a relaxed liberal view of sex and sexuality that you simply won't find elsewhere in the world.\n\nPremarital sex been acceptable in Scandinavia for centuries, they share Germany's relaxed view of nudity and you'll often see sexual images during the day on telly.\n\nAbortion has been legal for 30 years and gay and lesbian people now have pretty much equal rights as heterosexual people.\n\nTracey said the Scandinavians get it right, every time, when it comes to sex and we Brits could learn a thing or two from them. (File photo)\n\nWhy so liberated?\n\nThe Swedish government believes teaching children about sex is crucial to keeping STI rates and teenage pregnancies to a minimum. Teens aren't just shown how to put a condom on a banana (aka the English way) but taught how orgasms can be pleasurable.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nIt works.\n\nScandinavian's teens have fewer sexual partners, start having sex at a later age and have fewer STI's than other countries.\n\nTeenagers who are educated about sex grow up to be sexually healthy adults who enjoy more satisfying sex and consequently better relationships than those who aren't taught about sex.\n\nBecause Scandinavians aren't big churchgoers, sex isn't seen as 'sinful' - which works well for females.\n\nWomen are seen as having as much right to sexual experiences as men.\n\nIceland is rated the best place in the world to be a woman - women have the most equal access to education and healthcare \u2013 with Finland, Norway and Sweden coming in second, third and fourth.\n\nThere's a lot to learn from Scandinavia. But the biggest lesson of all is that sex education doesn't encourage promiscuity, as some people think, it makes it less likely.\n\nYou'll find more advice on love, sex and relationships on traceycox.com.
