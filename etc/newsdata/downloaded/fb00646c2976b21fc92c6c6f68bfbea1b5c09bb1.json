Gerry Connolly and Tom Malinowski are also interested.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is on the list of inquiries to be pursued,\u201d Connolly told POLITICO on Tuesday, saying the question of potential \u201cextortion\u201d of Ukraine will be \u201ca major part of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to ask about it,\u201d added Malinowski.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky\u2014in which he urged him to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and issues surrounding the 2016 election, all while withholding military assistance aid to Kiev\u2014and the concurrent pressure placed on Zelensky by U.S. diplomats has led some Democrats to view the Javelin sale in a new light.\n\nThe U.S. completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine in May 2018, finalizing a sale that was pushed by lawmakers in both parties and reluctantly approved by Trump in November 2017. In April 2018, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered Ukraine\u2019s top anti-corruption prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko\u2014who\u2019d been tasked with investigating corruption that occurred under former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych\u2014to stop cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nMueller, at that point, was investigating former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s work for Yanokovych in Ukraine and his ties to Russia.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Bob Menendez and Patrick Leahy sent a letter to Lutsenko on May 4, 2018, expressing their \u201cgreat concern\u201d about reports that the investigation had been impeded\u2014and asking directly whether \u201cany individual from the Trump administration, or anyone acting on its behalf\u201d encouraged Ukrainian government or law enforcement officials not to cooperate with the Mueller probe. They never received a response, according to a spokesman for Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nLutsenko, who met with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani earlier this year as part of Giuliani's ongoing efforts to investigate what he claims is Ukraine's \"interference\" in the 2016 election, has not replied to multiple requests for comment in recent days. The White House did not reply to questions about the Javelin sale.\n\nThere was no evidence at the time that Trump had directly asked the Ukrainians to halt the cooperation, and a New York Times report indicated that the Ukrainians had done it of their own volition to stay on the president\u2019s good side.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said refraining from selling Javelins to Ukraine had been \u201ca bad policy in the Obama administration\u201d that top Trump administration officials including then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were eager to reverse. (The Obama administration\u2019s hesitance to approve the sale of the Javelins, officials said at the time, was primarily due to their concern that Russia, which was pouring troops and weapons into eastern Ukraine, could use the missiles as a pretext to escalate the conflict.)\n\nThe source acknowledged that it \u201ctook a few rounds for the president to get his support\u201d before he signed off on it, but said he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware of anything related to Mueller at that time.\u201d\n\nStill, other sources said at the time that Trump wasn\u2019t looking to sell the Javelins to the Ukrainians for nothing. To get him on board, Trump\u2019s national security advisers emphasized that this would be a sale, not a gift, said a U.S. official with direct involvement in the matter. And Poroshenko won favor with Trump by facilitating an $80 million coal deal\u2014the first between the U.S. and Ukraine\u2014that was politically expedient for both leaders. Less than two months after the State Department approved the sale, Ukrainian Railways signed a $1 billion locomotive deal with GE Transportation, which boosted Trump\u2019s campaign promise to revitalize the U.S. rail industry.\n\nNow, Democrats want to know if there were other incentives at play\u2014especially in light of Zelensky\u2019s comment, in his July call with Trump, that Ukraine is almost ready to buy additional Javelins from the U.S. \u201cfor defense purposes.\u201d Trump responded by asking for \u201ca favor\u201d\u2014namely, that Zelensky investigate Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election, with help from the Attorney General.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But this person couldn\u2019t recall whether the Democrats specifically asked whether there had been a quid pro quo.\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have continued to support Manafort, who is currently serving a 7.5-year prison sentence for tax and financial fraud crimes.\n\nThe president has defended his former campaign chairman whom he had a joint defense agreement\u2014as a \u201cgood man\u201d and has said he feels \u201cbadly\u201d for him, calling his conviction \u201ca very sad situation.\u201d And Giuliani, who has long maintained that Manafort was framed by falsified documents, has reportedly continued to communicate with Manafort through his lawyer as he continues investigating the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election to bring Trump and Manafort down.\n\nRussia has been making a similar accusation since December 2016, when Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused Ukraine of trying to sabotage Trump\u2019s campaign by exposing a \u201cblack ledger\u201d revealing that Manafort hid millions in payments for his work for Yanukovych. That ledger became public in August 2016 via the New York Times, and led to Manafort\u2019s resignation as campaign chairman that month.\n\nManafort began pushing the White House and RNC to allege \u201ccollusion\u201d between Ukraine and Democrats in the spring of 2017 to distract from the ongoing Russia investigation, POLITICO first reported. But prosecutors had Manafort\u2019s financial records, not just the so-called ledger, and even Giuliani acknowledged that he didn\u2019t think he could fully \u201cexonerate\u201d the disgraced Republican operative.\n\n\u201cThis is a large puzzle that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for the better part of three years and more recently it seems like we\u2019re finding more pieces of the puzzle,\u201d said Costa.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ac/46/43348dbb406e9353c24da1586ae5/20191008-anti-tank-missiles-kiev-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
