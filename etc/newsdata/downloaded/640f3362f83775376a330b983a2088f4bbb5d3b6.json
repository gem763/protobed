A government whistleblower has taken the episode a step further, alleging that Trump had threatened to withhold almost $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine if Zelensky failed to comply.\n\n\n\nIn May, as the pressure campaign was evolving, Pompeo recalled then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who has served under numerous administrations of both parties. Yovanovitch's removal came after she voiced concerns that the administration had crossed a line in enlisting foreign help to boost Trump's 2020 campaign, and in her testimony to Congress earlier this month, she told lawmakers she thought her removal was politically motivated.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Reeker was prepared to testify that his effort to rally support for Yovanovitch was thwarted by Pompeo, whose defense of Trump's handling of the Yovanovitch affair has infuriated many State Department veterans.\n\n\n\nYet Rep.
