Maxine Waters: Trump needs to be put 'in solitary confinement'", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized Republicans and said President Donald Trump needed to be \"imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement\" because \"impeachment is not good enough for Trump.\"\n\nWaters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, called on the Republican Party to stop using \"Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,\" before adding that she thought Trump needed to be put into solitary confinement.\n\n\"But for now, impeachment is the imperative,\" she added.\n\nWaters had been referring to Trump's remarks recorded at a private event in New York City last week, where he called whoever had informed the whistleblower about his call with the President of Ukraine \"almost a spy,\" suggested they had committed treason, and added \"We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nWaters also called for the impeachment of Attorney General William Barr, who she referred to as \"Trump's puppet,\" for his alleged involvement in the controversy over Trump's contacts with the Ukranian government.\n\n\"The lies, coverups, shaking down foreign countries & undermining our democracy will be recorded as one of the worst periods in the history of our country, all led by a dishonorable con man,\" she tweeted later.\n\nI'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative. \u2014 Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) October 1, 2019\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Democrats suggest Pompeo stonewalling, after he pushes back on impeachment requests\n\nWhistleblower: 'Horrific and chilling': Whistleblower advocates complain as Trump tries to identify source of Ukraine complaint\n\nRep. Mark Amodei takes heat for impeachment remarks 'Let's put it through and see what happens'\n\nWaters has been an outspoken critic of the president. Trump has called her \"low IQ\" and warned her to \"be careful what you wish for\" in tweets posted in June of last year after Waters had advocated for the harassment of Trump administration Cabinet officials in a speech.\n\n\"Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,\" Waters said to a crowd. \"And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Maxine Waters: Trump should be imprisoned in 'solitary confinement'", "description": "Maxine Waters said President Trump needed to be \"imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement\" because \"impeachment is not good enough for Trump.\"", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YmeAywKrWPH6dgez1BNnOg--~B/aD0yNjc0O3c9NDAxMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/717fcdc4a993e753cdfceb6bb5d98972", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
