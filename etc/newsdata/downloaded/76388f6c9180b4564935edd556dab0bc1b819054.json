And no one can say exactly when it began or ended. The attacks picked up in the mid-1990s, as Israel pursued a peace deal and ceded land, but the worst came between 2000 and 2004. Though other forms of violence persist, the last Israeli fatality in a Palestinian suicide bombing was in 2008.\n\nThis repression of memory has helped the Palestinian leadership pretend that none of it ever happened, and few of the foreign journalists covering the country right now were here at the time. Why are moderate Israelis afraid to pull out of the West Bank? Why has the once-dominant left become a meager parliamentary remnant? Why is there a separation barrier? Why is the word \u201cpeace\u201d pronounced with sarcasm while the word \u201csecurity\u201d carries a kind of supernatural weight? If you weren\u2019t in Israel then and can\u2019t access the national subconscious now, the answer will be elusive.\n\nThe film\u2019s Ronen is the alter ego of Yossi Atia, 39, who plays him and wrote and co-directed the film. Mr. Atia, like me, lived through those years in Jerusalem as a college student. His character can\u2019t bear the silence, or the feeling that he\u2019s crazy for remembering, so he starts leading sightseeing tours of his own in the heart of the city: the Sbarro pizzeria, the place where two bombers exploded together near Zion Square, the vegetable market that got hit again and again.\n\nHe hands tourists old Nokia cellphones and has them simulate one of the period\u2019s key rituals: the calls we used to make after attacks to tell our families we were O.K. It\u2019s unclear if this is meant as education for the people he\u2019s showing around, or therapy for him. He explains the odd social calculations that would follow an attack: If eight people, say, had just been killed on a bus, could you go out with a friend for a drink that evening? (Yes.) What if it was 12 people in a cafe? Could you go on a date? (No.) Ronen has an actual chart.\n\nI remember those quandaries of terror etiquette, just as I remember standing at a bus stop when I heard a suicide bomber blow himself up and murder 11 people one street over, at Caf\u00e9 Moment. My mother passed through the Nahariya train station right before a suicide bomber struck there, and my sister was in a cafeteria at the Hebrew University campus when Palestinians blew up a different cafeteria. I\u2019ve got many more memories like that, all of them standard for the time.\n\nWhen I spoke to Mr. Atia, he said he thought Israelis avoid the subject for an obvious reason: It\u2019s too awful. Because the carnage wasn\u2019t on a distant battlefield or limited to soldiers, the experience encompassed the whole society, and you don\u2019t forget images or fear like that even if you\u2019ve forced it all down to the murkiest layers of your brain. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a military war, it was a civil war, and the victims were civilians,\u201d he said. His character, Ronen, wants to talk about it, and that makes him strange: \u201cNo one wants to listen.\u201d\n\nMr. Atia\u2019s movie doesn\u2019t trade in any discernible anger at the Palestinians or anyone else, even when Ronen demonstrates how the Sbarro bomber rigged his explosives inside a guitar case. The approach is a kind of light surrealism. The closest thing to political comment comes when he points out that the memorial plaques from the bombings of the 1990s, the years of the peace process, followed the victims\u2019 names with the traditional Jewish phrase \u201cMay their memories be blessed.\u201d By the early aughts it had changed to a different phrase drawn from tradition: \u201cMay God avenge their blood.\u201d", "description": "The decisive factor in next week\u2019s election \u2014 and the reason for Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s durability \u2014 is a repressed memory.", "authors": ["Matti Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09mattiWeb/09mattiWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
