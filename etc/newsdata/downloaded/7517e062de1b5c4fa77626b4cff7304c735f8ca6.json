I would say it is totally crazy, terrific if he can make it,\u201d said Nicole Pahl, 48, who herself runs marathons and travelled to Austria from neighbouring Germany to see the Kenyan\u2019s attempt.\n\nKipchoge holds the men\u2019s world record for the distance with a time of 2hr 01min 39sec, which he set in the flat Berlin marathon on September 16, 2018.\n\nHe tried in May 2017 to break the two-hour barrier, running on the Monza National Autodrome racing circuit in Italy, failing narrowly in 2hr 00min 25sec.\n\nBut this time he says he is mentally stronger and more confident.\n\n\u201cI just have to make that click in people\u2019s minds that no human is limited,\u201d he told a press conference this week.\n\nHe said his attempt in the Austrian capital is about \u201cmaking history in this world, like the first man to go to the moon\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Surfaces evened out \u2013\n\nBecause of the way the run is being set up and paced the International Association of Athletics Federations will not validate the time as a world record.\n\nThe running surface has been partly retarred and readied with other features such as a banked corner that can save time and avoid injury.\n\nPacemakers are taking turns to support him throughout the 42.195-kilometre (26.219-miles) race.\n\nThat includes a 4.3 kilometre-long straight alley, which he runs up and down several times.\n\n\u201cThe course is extremely good. I\u2019m happy with the course,\u201d Kipchoge, whose family has accompanied him to Vienna, said earlier this week.\n\nWeather conditions are favourable with very low wind speed and no rain.\n\nFan zones have also been set up along the course. Organisers are only allowing their own cameras to film the run itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s history in the making. I\u2019m very proud\u2026 It will be a motivation to a lot of young people. People are looking up to him,\u201d said Nichasius Koech, 37, a software engineer from Kenya who works in Germany.\n\nThe course has been prepared so that it should take Kipchoge just about 4.5 seconds more than on a computer-simulated completely flat and straight path, according to analysis by sports experts at Vienna University.\n\nIn total, he will only have to descend 26 metres in altitude and climb 12 metres, the experts said.\n\nThe founder of the main sponsors, Ineos, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, is taking a personal interest in the challenge and himself competes in Ironman triathlons.\n\nThe world marathon record has, for the past 16 years, been contested uniquely between athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia. The two nations are also fierce rivals for distance medals on the track.\n\nKipchoge\u2019s record was almost beaten last month in the Berlin marathon by Ethiopia\u2019s Kenenisa Bekele, who ran 2:01.41, just two seconds short of the official world mark.", "description": "Vienna (AFP) \u2013 Accompanied by seven pacemakers, Kenya\u2019s Eliud Kipchoge started running Saturday in his quest to bust the mythical two-hour", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/4effe7_kenya-eliud-kipchoge-attempt-break-two-hour-barrier-on-12-2019-marathon-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
