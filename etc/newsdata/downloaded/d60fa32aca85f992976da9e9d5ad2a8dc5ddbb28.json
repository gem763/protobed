I survived miraculously. I am usually a relaxed person in life but, no matter how relaxed I am, this event took its toll on me.\u201d\n\nGovernment documents show that fewer than 10% of the country\u2019s population is receiving help. Women and girls, in particular, face extra obstacles. Their access to health services is \u201coften determined by male members of their household and may be conditioned on the availability of segregated services with female staff and segregated infrastructure, such as separate gates and waiting areas\u201d, said HRW.\n\nIn Shahi\u2019s case, however, the issue was mainly the lack of services. Doctors failed to refer her to a mental health professional.\n\n\u201cI had stress and panic attacks and I went to see a doctor in Kabul, but they said I have no issues. I couldn\u2019t breathe properly, I felt as if I was about to have a heart attack,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said I have psychological problems but they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. They didn\u2019t refer me to a psychiatrist, they didn\u2019t give me any address for one.\u201d\n\nShahi was forced to go to neighbouring Iran for treatment. There, a psychiatrist started a treatment plan that she later continued by phone and online through Telegram, a messaging app, when she returned to Afghanistan. She finally started to get better.\n\n\u201cIn Afghanistan, psychiatrists and psychologists are not easily available. That\u2019s why I had to travel to Iran. Afghans with health problems usually travel to Pakistan or India,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPoverty is increasing and people are targeted with violence. This has taken hope away from people. The real figure of people struggling with mental health in Afghanistan is even more than what\u2019s been announced. This is the reality. People don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be alive tomorrow or not.\u201d\n\nAnxiety is a daily experience, said Shahi. \u201cToday I was at home resting and my sister said she was going to take the public transport to her university. I got anxious and thought: \u2018What if there\u2019s an explosion on her way to university?\u2019 This is just one example of stress. The stress you\u2019re facing here is not just about you and your life, it\u2019s also about people surrounding you.\u201d\n\nShahi said her biggest stress these days is not yet having got married. \u201cGirls like me have a hard time dealing with a traditional society [while unmarried]. Because of political circumstances, you can\u2019t foresee a future in this country.\u201d\n\nIn an already weak health system, the government spends as little as $0.26 (21p) a person on mental health \u2013 far below the $3-4 a person recommended by the World Health Organization. There is just one psychiatrist for every 435,000 people, and one psychologist for every 333,000, while in public mental health facilities there are as few as 200 beds available, equating to one bed for every 172,500 people.\n\n\u201cDecades of violence have left many Afghans experiencing deep psychological wounds, as well as physical ones,\u201d said Jonathan Pedneault, HRW\u2019s conflict and crisis researcher.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need for expanded psychosocial services to support Afghans exposed to violence, suicide bombings and airstrikes, and [to] prevent the long-term effects that can be debilitating to survivors, families, and entire communities.\u201d\n\n'I'm like a mouse in a trap': trauma of Europe's refugees \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nAfghans face a range of obstacles to access mental health services, from poverty to health literacy, social exclusion to stigma.\n\nAccording to Hasan Rezaee, an Afghan academic and government adviser on social affairs, a major problem facing mental health in Afghanistan is cultural.\n\n\u201cIn a conservative and traditional country like Afghanistan, a lot of mental health conditions are not being seen as disease,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen figures were released a while ago, people were dismissive and they couldn\u2019t believe the figures, they thought the figures were untrue and propagated by western countries. People, and a lot officials as well, don\u2019t take mental health diseases seriously.\u201d\n\nRezaee added: \u201cBoth the government and the health sector are not yet mentally and culturally ready to give priority to the mental health problems. The priority is given to sectors that are considered tangible, such as patients facing death or physical diseases.\u201d", "description": "In a country where decades of conflict have taken a profound toll on mental health, professional support is scarce", "authors": ["Saeed Kamali Dehghan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7273e57d1ee29e7d590cc89bf92581378fa0a3bc/0_96_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70965d23facdeceb4e0d8db1bbe881e7", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
