Greg Hardy is apparently \u2013 and on short notice, in enemy territory.\n\nHardy, coming off a controversial no contest this past weekend, has decided to fill in on 18 days\u2019 notice for the injured Junior Dos Santos. Hardy will fight Alexander Volkov on Nov. 9 in the UFC on ESPN+ 21 co-main event.\n\nDos Santos vs. Volkov previously had been booked as the headliner. Instead, the featherweight fight between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar has been elevated as the headliner but will remain scheduled for three rounds.\n\nA UFC official confirmed the news to MMA Junkie on Tuesday following an initial report by ESPN.\n\nLast Friday at UFC on ESPN 6, former NFL All-Pro Hardy put on perhaps his most impressive performance, going three rounds with Ben Sosoli. He initially earned a unanimous decision, only to have it changed to a no contest after the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission reviewed Hardy\u2019s use of an inhaler in between Rounds 2 and 3.\n\nA win over Russian contender Volkov, the No. 7 heavyweight in the official UFC rankings, no doubt would be the biggest win of Hardy\u2019s early MMA career, especially considering the circumstances.\n\n\u201cThis was Greg\u2019s idea,\u201d Hardy\u2019s manager, Malki Kawa, told ESPN. \u201cHe trains with Junior Dos Santos at American Top Team and saw that he was sick. He called me up and asked what I thought about him fighting Volkov. I actually didn\u2019t like the fight for him. I thought maybe it was too soon, but Greg wants to step up in competition. He thinks he can go to Moscow and knock him out, and he wanted to help the promotion, which is exactly what he did.\u201d\n\nVolkov, a former Bellator champion, hasn\u2019t fought since October of last year, when he was knocked out by Derrick Lewis in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe opportunity for Hardy to step in came about after it was discovered earlier Tuesday that Dos Santos has been hospitalized with a bacterial infection in his leg.", "description": "Greg Hardy apparently is ready to take a step up in competition \u2013 and on short notice, in enemy territory.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Dan Tom", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greg-hardy-ufc-boston.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
