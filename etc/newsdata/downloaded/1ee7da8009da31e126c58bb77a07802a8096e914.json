It was basically fight or flight. I was like \u2019man, I\u2019m in trouble here. I could possibly lose my life\u2019.\n\n\u201cOut of that came a fighting attitude. I thought, \u2019I\u2019m not ready to give in yet\u2019, though nor was I equipped with the tools to deal with the situation.\n\n\u201cPeople have since asked why didn\u2019t I have a gun, or a taser? I didn\u2019t have time for all that stuff. I was very, very lucky.\u201d\n\nUp until a year ago he was still dealing with the after-effects. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve entirely got my deep sleep back,\u201d Mitchell said then. \u201cI\u2019m always aware of noises.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhat the incident did for the former All Blacks boss was to put rugby into perspective. He talks of how it \u201csharpened him up big time\u201d, enabling him to make \u201ccritical decisions on what I wanted to achieve and how I wanted to go about it\u201d.\n\nPrior to the attack he says he was very hard on himself, a legacy of losing the New Zealand job after semi-final defeat, ironically to an Eddie Jones-coached Australia side in 2003.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d fallen into the outcome bubble, I\u2019d lost perspective because I was wanting to prove a point,\u201d said the 55-year old. \u201cI fell into the trap of being generic in the way I handled personalities.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m now relaxed about everything but you don\u2019t last if you don\u2019t evolve and you don\u2019t learn.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSo good a job has Mitchell done that in June, with Jones\u2019 full blessing, England extended his contract until 2021.\n\nNot that he is looking beyond Saturday where he predicts \u201cwe are going to witness the two most powerful rugby teams in the world\u201d and warns: \u201cthe the gain line is going to be huge\u201d.\n\n\u201cDefence has been, I think, a common thread that\u2019s come out of World Cups over the years and it\u2019s going to be really important again on the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt is a mentality thing. South Africa are probably the one side in the world that can create pressure like no other team.\n\n\u201cBut what is great is that there is now another team that can create that pressure - and that is us.\u201d", "description": "John Mitchell was hired by Eddie Jones to build a defence capable of leading England to Rugby World Cup glory", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756237.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1178685887.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
