Mr Enzanga was beaten up during the course of his activities street dealing.\u201d\n\nHe asked that Enzanga\u2019s relative youth be taken into account when passing sentence, telling the court that he was just 19 when the offence took place.\n\nMr Frymann called for his client to receive a determinate sentence, rather than one extended by an official finding of dangerousness under the law.\n\nCamera phone image issued by Hampshire Police of drug dealer Michael Enzanga (Hampshire Police/PA)\n\n\u201cHere is someone who is so young that the court should not make a final decision about whether he is and/or will be dangerous in future where so much changes or is capable of changing in a young person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nJudge Hetherington sentenced him to 16 years in prison, with a further four years on licence.\n\nHe must serve at least two thirds of the 16 years before he is eligible for parole.\n\nJudge Hetherington told Enzanga: \u201cYou were no innocent dupe, you were already an experienced criminal as your convictions show.\n\n\u201cYou knew exactly what you were about.\n\n\u201cIn order to escape (you) took out your knife and plunged it twice in the back of Pc Turner.\u201d\n\nHe blasted Enzanga for his \u201chopeless attempt\u201d to evade justice in the face of \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d at trial.\n\n\u201cYou would stop at nothing in order to save your own skin.\u201d\n\nAddressing the issue of dangerousness under the law, Judge Hetherington said that Enzanga poses a \u201chigh risk of serious harm, especially to police officers\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are still quite young in age but in my judgment that did not affect your responsibility for this offence.\u201d\n\nFollowing the sentencing Russell Turner said: \u201cOn the day this happened, Pc Clare Parry and I went on patrol in Stamshaw Park with two objectives: firstly to find and safeguard who we thought was a vulnerable young man and secondly to protect the local community.\n\n\u201cNeither of us expected to get stabbed.\n\n\u201cStamshaw Park should be a nice place to walk the dog, take the children to or just to go for a walk in, it shouldn\u2019t be a place where someone thinks that it is all right to deal drugs and carry a knife, and on that day in broad daylight during half term.\n\n\u201cClare and I have been beat officers for a long time and have always listened to and tried to respond to what our communities are telling us.\n\n\u201cWe are not unique in this and police officers do care and want to make the communities in which they work safer places for the public.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we were trying to do.\n\n\u201cThat community has been fantastic in supporting us and assisting so brilliantly with the investigation, and for that I will be eternally grateful.\n\n\u201cI also want to say thank you for the support my family and I have had from colleagues and members of the public during what has been a very difficult time for us. It has helped immensely.\n\n\u201cI have now left Hampshire Constabulary, partly because of this incident, and want to pass on my best wishes to everyone and hope you all stay safe.\u201d\n\nHampshire Constabulary Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said there are 19 assaults on her staff every week, on average.\n\n\u201cPolice officers and staff are regularly subjected to violence and threats which too often result in injury.\n\n\u201cIt is never acceptable to assume that assaults upon police officers and staff should be tolerated, it is not simply \u2018part of the job\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to protect the public, but we are all too often prevented from doing so due to violent individuals who choose to attack those who are there to help them.\u201d", "description": "Michael Enzanga must serve at least two thirds of the sentence.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/13/wire-19489322-1570622638-916_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
