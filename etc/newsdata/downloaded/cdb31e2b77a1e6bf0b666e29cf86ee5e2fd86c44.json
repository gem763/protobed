Duck neck and chicken hearts on the menu", "language": "en", "text": "While most Seattle residents are fast asleep under their 800-thread count comforters during the wee hours of Saturday morning, Dawn Ford is crawling out of bed.\n\nBy 3:30 a.m., Dawn has showered, brushed her teach, thrown her reddish-brown hair into a messy bun and painted her face with makeup. Wearing sweats and comfortable sneakers, she pulls out of her driveway and makes the five-minute commute to her office. The streets are quiet and empty of people, save for a few homeless residents and those drunk souls who couldn\u2019t find Ubers after the local dive bars closed.\n\nArriving to work, she turns off the alarm and starts making a to-do list on the dry erase board hanging on the wall. She ties an apron around her waist and fires up the oven before grabbing her ingredients from around the kitchen.\n\nFlour? Check.\n\nEggs? Check.\n\nCheese? Check.\n\nTime to start baking.\n\nIt\u2019s a true labor of love for this 38-year-old dog lover, who owns and operates the dog treat company \u201cThe Seattle Barkery\u201d with her husband, Ben.\n\nreidathegolden\n\nThe couple, who spend their weekends baking and decorating treats for their business, came up with the idea for the upscale dog treat company after discovering a hole in the marketplace.\n\nSeveral years ago, Dawn and Ben had owned their own dog walking service, and at the end of each walk, would give their doggy clients what they had thought were \u201cnatural, organic\u201d treats. But when they discovered those treats were poor quality or had been recalled, they were horrified.\n\nThen Dawn had a thought.\n\n\u201cHow hard could it be to make our own?\u201d\n\nTurns out: hard.\n\n\u201cWe had all the taste testers we could want with our business,\u201d said Dawn. \u201c[But] dog treat recipes can be really complicated and have a lot of ingredients that you don\u2019t necessarily have on hand\u2026 like bone broth or brewer\u2019s yeast.\u201d\n\nDawn wrestled with the various online recipes and couldn\u2019t understand why the dogs weren\u2019t enjoying the expensive and hard-to-make treats, so she started researching what human foods dogs were allowed to eat.\n\n\u201cDogs love human food,\u201d began Dawn, \u201cso how can we make this more appealing for them and simple for me?\u201d\n\nCheese, peanut butter and apple were high on the list.\n\nThe Fords took their new recipes \u2013 cheesy donuts with grain free flour and peanut butter apple bites \u2013 to the local farmers market and sold out every weekend.\n\nBut the long set-up and tear-down hours of the farmers market started to take their toll on Dawn and Ben. The Seattle rain certainly didn\u2019t help either. That\u2019s when Dawn noticed the food trucks at the farmers market and became green with envy. Those food trucks would be the last ones in and the first ones out, according to Dawn, and all they had to do was open their windows. She realized maybe they too could capitalize on the ease of a food truck\u2026 albeit for dogs.\n\nThe Fords starting combing through Craigslist\u2019s ads, finally settling on a well-used, dark turquoise former maintenance truck that lovingly came with the name \u201cBuster.\u201d\n\nThe Seattle Barkery\n\n$20,000 later and the retrofitted dog treat truck was ready to hit the road.\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the truck opened it\u2019s window for the first time, but it\u2019s still causing a bit of confusion. Some people even think it\u2019s a hot dog truck, explained Dawn.\n\n\u201cSome other [humans] just come up and start ordering and you can just tell that there\u2019s some confusion. So we\u2019ll say \u2018Where\u2019s your dog at today?\u2019\u201d Dawn continued.\n\n\u201cPeople then exclaim \u2018Ohmygosh!\u2019 And then they are so embarrassed. And they\u2019ll say \u2018I thought the chicken feet were weird but everything else looks good,'\u201d added Dawn with a laugh.\n\nSometimes though, people will still try to order the dog treats for themselves.\n\n\u201cWhat I found if that pretty much every culture eats the whole chicken except for America,\u201d explained Ben, a 40-year-old King County resident hailing from Colorado.\n\n\u201cA lot of Brazilians will try to order the chicken hearts themselves because it\u2019s a common street food there.\u201d And while all of the company\u2019s ingredients are human-grade, Ben noted that the food still isn\u2019t licensed for human consumption.\n\nThe Seattle Barkery\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t see a leash attached to them, I start asking some questions,\u201d said Ben, chuckling to himself.\n\nFor the most part, Dawn said there\u2019s some level of familiarity with new customers, who may have heard about the truck\u2019s other locations through dog park friends.\n\nWith the foundation of their truck\u2019s success, The Fords also opened a \u201ctreat bar\u201d at Dogwood (an indoor dog park where dog owners can drink alcohol while watching their pets) and staioned a permanent vintage trailer named \u201cHammy\u201d stationed near Lake Washington at the Magnuson Off-leash dog park.\n\nRachelle Erickson Photography via The Seattle Barkery\n\nAccording to Ben, the truck serves between 3,500-5,500 loyal fans a year, including Molly Oberndorf\u2019s two Goldendoodles, Moose and Nellie.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m nuts,\u201d said Oberndorf, laughing, \u201cBut in a good way,\u201d she added quickly. Whenever they visit the Barkery truck, her dogs run nose first up to the aptly named \u201ctreat tunnel,\u201d a device that drops a free treat down a shoot and into the waiting, drooling mouths of her dogs.\n\nOberndorf said her dogs, who are partial to the truck\u2019s \u201cbeefy sticks\u201d and \u201cbacon birthday cakes\u201d have sensitive stomachs \u2013 something that Dawn said is one reason owners trust their treats.\n\n\u201c[Our foods] do have a shelf life and that\u2019s what\u2019s appealing to people. They\u2019re not all hard and they won\u2019t stay fresh on your shelf for two years and be \u2018edible,\u2019\u201d said Dawn, a mom of her own three pups.\n\nThose treats include peanut butter cookies, pumpkin pretzels, bacon cupcakes and doggie icew cream sundaes with edible bowls.\n\nmariner_moose_dood\n\nFor the pups' owners, the truck sells a special brand of local coffee, called the \u201cLeg Lifter Blend.\u201d\n\nThe truck\u2019s number-one selling dog product are always the chicken hearts that have been air fried in coconut oil \u2013 think popcorn for dogs, as it were.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been burned by treats at the pet store or the rock hard treats. You don\u2019t want to be duped into spending $15 on a bag of treats [your dogs] don\u2019t like,\u201d continued Dawn.\n\n\u201cMaybe they just want something less processed,\" she said.\n\nKeeping up with that less-processed workload has proven a lot harder than the Fords were expecting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream scenario. We don\u2019t have any social life. When we go out with other friends and family, I\u2019m like, \u2018You want to go out at 7:30pm? I go to bed at 8 o\u2019clock,'\u201d said Dawn, laughing.\n\nThe couple considered franchising, but quickly agreed that wasn\u2019t a business model that worked for them.\n\n\u201cTo even become a franchise is about $40,000, and then you got to hope that somebody is going to be crazy enough as you to do what you do,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nquigleyanne.the.toller\n\nAlmost every day, the Fords receive a phone call or email asking for advice on how to start a dog food truck in another city. And while they fully encourage others to try it, they warn the process may turn most folks off.\n\nBetween the licensing and permitting processes, registering recipes with the Department of Agrucultue, random health inspections and the daily grind of the baking business, the Fords admitted they may not have gone into the dog food truck business had they known five years ago what they know now.\n\n\u201cFive years in, you know, we know our health inspector by name,\u201d said Dawn. \u201cWe have a good relationship with the city,\u201d she continued, \u201cBut it\u2019s very daunting and it\u2019s a lot of money right up front. If you just want to do it on the weekend, you\u2019re never going to make a return. You really gotta hustle.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the Fords said are putting every penny they earn directly back into the business \u2013 they are preparing to open their first official brick-and-mortar store in January within a new Amazon building.\n\nIn the meantime, the Fords continue to stock their various locations and take orders for specialty cakes \u2013 they\u2019ve made bakery items for \u201cGender Reveal\u201d parties and celebrated a dog\u2019s \u201cBark Mitzvah,\u201d amongst others.\n\nvia The Seattle Barkery\n\nOn the whole, the company gets a ton of positive feedback.\n\n\u201cThere are a few older generations that kind of roll their eyes that say \u2018Only in Seattle\u2019\u201d eplained Ben. \u201cAnd I laugh and say \u2018You\u2019re right, only in Seattle!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut regardless of what anyone thinks, Ben said he knows how lucky they are. The company just celebrated it\u2019s five-year anniversary last week.\n\n\u201cI tell my employees: It\u2019s such a great job because your customer is already walking up to you and smiling,\u201d said Ben, \u201cSo that\u2019s very rewarding.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
