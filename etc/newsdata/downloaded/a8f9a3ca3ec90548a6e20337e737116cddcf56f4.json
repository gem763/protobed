Procedurally, my transfer was also flawed. I was told that the inspectorate needs my services, and that turned out to be untrue.\u201d\n\nHawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said they received court papers on the Mokotedi matter three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the motion application \u2026 we are opposing the application. Our grounds for opposing the application will be advanced in court. The matter is sub judice and we cannot comment further.\u201d", "description": "The former head of the Gauteng elite crime-fighting unit, Prince Mokotedi, believes the labour court should force police top brass to reinstate him into the position he was moved from nine months ago.", "authors": ["Abram Mashego"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9362/22fa1550d47248ddb7e815496f7b4258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
