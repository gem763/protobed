SIG shares tumble on profit warning as UK construction craters\n\nBy Yadarisa Shabong\n\n(Reuters) - Building materials supplier SIG Plc (L: ) warned on Monday about significantly lower profits due to a weakening economic outlook in Britain and Germany, driving its shares down as much as 26% and rattling nerves across the construction industry.\n\nBritish construction has slumped, weighed down by uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union, while the German economy has been slipping towards recession even as construction remains buoyant.\n\nSIG's warning sent ripples through the Construction and Materials sector, with shares of bigger rivals Travis Perkins Plc (L: ), Howden Joinery Group Plc (L: ) and B&Q-Owner Kingfisher Plc (L: ) all lower.\n\nSIG said in its trading update that it had highlighted \"a number of key indicators pointing to further weakening of the macroeconomic backdrop, notably in the UK and in Germany.\"\n\n\"This deterioration in trading conditions has accelerated over recent weeks, and political and macro-economic uncertainty has continued to increase,\" the company said.\n\nShares of SIG were down 22% at 92.95 pence as of 0718 GMT after earlier flirting with a three-year low.\n\nThe Sheffield-based company expects much lower underlying profitability in both its specialist distribution and roofing merchant businesses compared to previous expectations.\n\nIt said it was taking actions to address the continuing market weakness, but did not divulge specific details.\n\nSIG reported underlying profit before tax of 75.3 million pounds ($92.6 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018.\n\nShore Capital analyst Graeme Kyle said the warning reflected \"political turmoil impacting construction project decisions in the UK\".\n\nThe company, which had repeatedly sounded warnings of a hit from Britain's construction industry woes, also separately announced the disposal of its air handling division and building solutions business.", "description": "SIG shares tumble on profit warning as UK construction craters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8O0Q3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
