The lobby will be ornamented with elegant colors of plum and gold, complete with a grand 12-foot-tall Christmas tree, wreaths and columns wrapped with garland, and more. From the moment guests step foot in the lobby, they are greeted by the sweet scent of Executive Pastry Chef Rabii Saber's holiday chocolate creation. Chef Saber, a 2019 James Beard Award semifinalist for Outstanding Pastry Chef, crafted the impressive 2018 holiday display, \"Penguins in Paradise\" with 150 pounds of chocolate, 90 pounds of fondant, and 60 pounds of frosting. The resort's holiday d\u00e9cor will be in place from December 1, 2019 through January 5, 2020.

Around corners and through back alleys, guests can encounter strange creatures and alien languages.
