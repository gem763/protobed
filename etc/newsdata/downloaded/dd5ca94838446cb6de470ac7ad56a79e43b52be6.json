Sign up here.\n\nHappy Friday the 13th everyone (spooky):\n\nAs with last week, the cannabis sector was dominated by the unfortunate news of vaping-related illnesses. As a refresher, I put together a timeline of what state and federal officials knew about the illnesses and when. You can read that here, and we'll keep updating it as we learn more.\n\nBut there was some other news apart from the vape scare that I'd like to highlight. First, Aurora Cannabis, one of the largest cannabis companies, reported earnings. While the company didn't have a bad quarter revenue-wise, it missed on its guidance by around 1% and the stock was hammered as a result.\n\nI spoke with Aurora Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley yesterday by phone. He said a few interesting things. One, he felt like the market has a \"follow-the-leader\" approach where, after companies like Canopy Growth and Cronos Group did deals with large alcohol and tobacco companies, investors expected Aurora to do the same.\n\n\"There's pressure there,\" said Battley. \"We don't want to give up control and enter partnerships that don't work for us.\"\n\nSecond, Battley reiterated that Aurora is actively looking at US CBD acquisitions, which we have reported on in the past. He also said that Aurora is looking closely at the landmark Canopy Growth-Acreage deal, and may consider pursuing a similar acquisition under that framework. We previously reported that the deal's unique (if vague) structure would provide a pathway for other Canadian cannabis companies to do the same.\n\nOn the policy front, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told the Democratic caucus that a bill to protect banks that serve cannabis companies will get a full House floor vote by the end of the month. The news follows Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo's statement to Politico that his committee will hold a vote on similar legislation.\n\nIn other news, I sat down with Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Ventures and author of \"The Fixer\" in his Manhattan offices on Wednesday to tape an episode of The Firewall podcast. We had a wide-ranging discussion that went from cannabis tech startups to psychedelic drugs, and Mexico's incipient cannabis legalization \u2014 all in a snackable 20 minutes. The episode will drop on Wednesday, and you can listen to it wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nAnd last, here's a tidbit I thought you all might like. I spoke with Marc Hauser, who leads the law firm Reed Smith LLP's cannabis practice earlier today.\n\nHe had a great quote around the regulatory complexity of cannabis and the challenges of putting together deals. \"It's both legal and highly regulated at the state level, and highly illegal at the federal level,\" Hauser told me. \"It's like a quantum physics problem.\"\n\n-Jeremy\n\nMore stories from around the BI newsroom:\n\nThe cannabis-infused-beverage startup K-Zen raised $5 million from the venerable Silicon Valley venture firm DCM Ventures in May.\n\nK-Zen co-CEO Judy Yee told Business Insider that the startup tailored its fundraising approach to investors who would be willing to invest in cannabis, as most mainstream venture funds are still reticent about the space.\n\nYee walked me through K-Zen's pitch deck and talked about the genesis of K-Zen in a recent interview.\n\nWall Street's star cannabis-industry analyst Vivien Azer initiated coverage on some of the splashiest US cannabis names \u2014 known as multistate operators or MSOs in industry parlance \u2014 including Curaleaf, Green Thumb Industries, Cresco Labs, Acreage Holdings, and MedMen.\n\nAzer's top US cannabis pick: Green Thumb Industries. She also likes Curaleaf and Cresco Labs, particularly as these companies balance wholesale and retail revenues.\n\nShe put a harsh price target on MedMen \u2014 $1.50. While she said the brand has strong equity in the lucrative California market, the company's constant need for cash and rampant spending will hurt it in the longterm.\n\nBrother-and-sister-duo Morgan and Emily Paxhia know what turns a pitch into funding for a startup.\n\nAs the managing partners of Poseidon Asset Management, a cannabis-focused investment firm, the pair have seen \u2014 and sat through \u2014 tons of pitches of varying quality. The two shared their best pieces of advice for startup founders looking to make a successful pitch in a recent webinar moderated by Business Insider.\n\nCheck out their three best tips here.\n\nCapital raises, M&A activity, partnerships, and launches", "description": "In this edition of Cultivated: DCM Ventures makes a bet on THC-infused beverage startup K-Zen, we break down Cowen analyst Vivien Azer's top US cannabis picks, and more.", "authors": ["Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7be9aa2e22af200b13648e-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
