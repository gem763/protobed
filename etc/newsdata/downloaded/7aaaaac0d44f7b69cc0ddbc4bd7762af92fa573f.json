But believe me, I'd trade it in for kids.'\n\nThe Uptown Funk hitmaker - whose five-year marriage to Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume ended in 2017 - previously admitted his latest record, Late Night Feelings, was inspired by his divorce as he was able to channel his sadness into the record.\n\nHe said: 'It's a break-up album. Every time I went to the studio I'd throw out ideas and some were light-hearted things but the ones staying with me all had melancholy.\n\n'You really have to go through something kind of f***-up to make good art sometimes ... it's not necessarily always how I've operated.\n\nCareer: The music producer, 44, told how working in the studio 'fills a void' inside him as he often forms close relationships with his collaborators (pictured in June 2018)\n\n'I think the idea of being a little bit rocked out of your comfort zone is a good thing.'\n\nAnd Mark recently quipped he'll make a similar album if he gets dumped again.\n\nAsked if he will 'remain in this mindset' for future records, he said: 'I think every record is always kind of hard to imagine where you're going to be ... it's a different time [unless] I get dumped between this and the next album.'\n\nMark made headlines recently during an appearance on Good Morning Britain when he was asked about French minister Marlene Schiappa being mocked for calling herself a sapiosexual - where a person is attracted to the intelligence of another person.\n\nAfter stating, 'yes I feel like I am identifying as sapiosexual' on the show, Mark apologised in an interview with Rolling Stone and clarified that he is not.\n\nHe said: 'I've never thought that [work] was a replacement for having a family of my own, but I definitely think it fills some of that void' (pictured in October 2019)\n\n'I do not consider myself part of any marginalized community and I apologize if anybody misunderstood or took offense to it,' he said.\n\nHe explained that the Good Morning Britain hosts had a debate going on about being sapiosexual and when he asked what it was, he was explained it was, 'when you\u2019re attracted to intelligence.'\n\nMark then said he stated, 'That sounds great. Of course, who wouldn\u2019t be?' before he was asked, 'about Miley Cyrus\u2019 dating life and something else I probably wasn\u2019t that informed to talk about, either, and then that was it.'\n\nMark added that after the interview, he returned to his hotel and saw that his comments were making headlines, which he found to be embarrassing.\n\nMark added: 'I do have these warm relationships that maybe [satisfy] part of my soul that needs fulfilling. But believe me, I'd trade it in for kids' (pictured in October 2019)\n\n'It sounds like I went on a TV show to be like, \"Guys, I have some big news!\" And the fact that I would go on and sort of declare myself \u2014 like as a heterosexual white male \u2014 part of any marginalized community was terrifying to me, or just embarrassing,' Ronson said.\n\nThe musician stated that, at first he wasn't terribly worried and thought his comments would be put in context, before adding, 'But that\u2019s not what happens on Twitter anymore.\n\n'I would like to say properly that I do not consider myself part of any marginalized community.'\n\nThe latest issue of Radio Times is on sale now.", "description": "The music producer, 44, told how working in the studio 'fills a void' inside him as he often forms close relationships with his collaborators but he would trade all his achievements for children.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440458-0-image-a-76_1570534563569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
