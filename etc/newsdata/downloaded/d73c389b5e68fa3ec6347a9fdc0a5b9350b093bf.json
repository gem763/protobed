At the very least, it would of course wreck Trump\u2019s bogus attorney-client privilege and absolute immunity claims.\n\nSo one could hardly be surprised that although Giuliani was definitely not acting as Trump\u2019s lawyer on Ukraine matters, he let on that he would hide behind the attorney-client privilege.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor a little while there, Democrats \u2014 especially three Democratic senators on the committee who are running for president (Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala D. Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota) \u2014 were pinching themselves, wondering if Graham actually made such an enticing offer.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Tuesday highlighted a potential dilemma for Giuliani as he decides whether he wants to take up Graham\u2019s offer to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a tweet, Harris responded to Graham\u2019s announcement on Twitter that he asked Giuliani to share his concerns \u201cabout corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.\u201d \u201cGood. I have questions,\u201d tweeted Harris, who has earned a reputation for her aggressive questioning of witnesses before the committee, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nThat would have been the ticket to reverse her drop in the polls. Harris was effective in grilling multiple nominees \u2014 including Attorney General William P. Barr, who, by the way, was stumped by her question as to whether Trump ever asked or suggested he investigate someone \u2014 as was Klobuchar, who led Kavanaugh to lash out at her question about whether he had engaged in excessive drinking.\n\nAD\n\nUntil now, Republicans have been averse to calling Giuliani, both because he might refuse to answer and/or turn the proceedings into a circus, as Corey Lewandowski did. However, the stakes here are extremely high from Giuliani and Trump. If you remember the devastating questioning of Lewandowski undertaken by House Judiciary Committee counsel Barry Berke, you may appreciate how a skilled questioner can expose a witness as a liar and eager Trump accomplice. In the case of Giuliani, who is far less disciplined than Lewandowski, one can only imagine what conversations, communications, meetings and evidence he might reveal.\n\nAD\n\nThe reaction of Republicans and Democrats to Graham\u2019s offer should be telling. Democrats, at this point, have a good enough command of the facts to know that Trump, aided by Giuliani, sought foreign assistance from, and held up aid to, Ukraine. They know what Giuliani has said previously. They see a golden opportunity to demonstrate how divorced from reality and contemptuous of the law are Trump and Giuliani. A first-year law student would be able to elicit dangerous admissions from Giuliani.\n\nIf Republicans dread the prospect of his testimony, they should ask themselves why they are so afraid to hear Giuliani expound upon his and Trump\u2019s efforts. It might just be that they know the July 25 phone call was not \u201cperfect,\u201d and know full well that a president cannot use a nongovernment official draped in the authority of the president to obtain dirt on a political opponent from foreign governments. They might fear Giuliani\u2019s appearance because he has flat-out admitted to raising the subject of the Bidens with foreign governments and, to boot, has adopted utterly insane conspiracy theories that Trump, his attorney general and a good segment of the Republican Party have bought into.\n\nAD\n\nGraham\u2019s offer really is too good to be true, so do not expect Giuliani to testify under oath. Nevertheless, the reaction to the possibility of his testimony should tell you a lot about the trouble Trump is in, and the impossibility of defending him once somebody (or many bodies) spill the beans.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "This is a recipe for disaster.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/reCo1Xz3r-ocC-WOZe820cQ6YWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KTCGF6HJAII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
