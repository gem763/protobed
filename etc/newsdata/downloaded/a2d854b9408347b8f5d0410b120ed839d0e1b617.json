This year's gathering is focused on the Pan-Amazonian region where the land is enduring catastrophic environmental destruction and indigenous peoples are threatened with multiple forms of cultural genocide. Catholics in the region are also affected by a severe shortage of priests, to the point that some are forced to go without access to the Eucharist for months, sometimes even years.", "description": "180 male bishops and priests in the Synod Hall will have a vote.
