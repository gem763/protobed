But more than anything, my friends stood by my side'; pictured with Justin Bieber in 2011\n\nSelena seemed genuinely touched when Zane clued her in on Taylor's statement.\n\n'[Taylor has been an] amazing [friend]... She was frustrated when I was frustrated; she was sad when I was sad. But more than anything, my friends stood by my side. I think they visibly saw me in so much pain. And they didn\u2019t want it for me but they\u2014' she paused, becoming visibly emotional.\n\n'They never stopped loving me. And I played her the song, and I played it with her mom and dad, and I showed her the video and her mom and Taylor started crying.\n\n'And it wasn\u2019t because the song was emotional. It was just because the first thing they said to me was, \"We\u2019re so happy that you\u2019re here. After seeing all of that, this is such a cool moment.\" And that\u2019s a huge thing for me.'\n\nSelena confirmed last week that her single Lose You To Love Me referenced her break-up from her longtime on\u2013off boyfriend Justin Bieber.", "description": "Selena Gomez posted a sweet Instagram photo praising her friend Taylor Swift.
