The Don is presented to an athlete whose sportsmanship and performance most inspired the nation.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t quite believe it to be honest,\u201d Barty said.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at my fellow nominees this year and people who have won the award before, I feel honoured to be a part of such an inspiring and talented group of Australians.\u201d\n\nNot that this tops three very impressive awards, but Barty just copped her own limited edition Vegemite Bartymite jar. Pitched as the Breakfast of Champions, Bartymite is available in all major supermarkets from mid-October, until sold out.", "description": "After a stunning season of tennis, World No. 1\u00a0Ash Barty\u00a0has been named Australia's sportswoman of the year at the Women's Health Women in Sport Awards.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179165718-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
