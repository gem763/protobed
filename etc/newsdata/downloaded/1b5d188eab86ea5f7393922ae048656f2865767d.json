There were no reports of fatalities or serious injuries early Monday, according to a release from the city of Dallas, but Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans says three people were hospitalized for evaluation of non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe storms also caused damage in Arkansas and Oklahoma as the system moved to the northeast early Monday. Power was out at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport in Highfill, about 155 miles (250 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. The airport says flights were still departing, though security screenings were being done manually.\n\nTornado warnings were in effect Monday morning in far eastern Arkansas near the Mississippi River as the storm system moved to the east. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, says areas of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee could see severe thunderstorms later Monday.\n\nIn Texas, heavy damage was reported in northwest Dallas and Richardson. Nearly 140,000 electric customers were without power as of 4 a.m. Monday, according to Oncor\u2019s online outage map. The electric utility said storms across East Texas had caused significant damage to power lines.\n\nAround 65,000 of the affected electric customers were within Dallas, according to the city, which said it would open a shelter.\n\nCrews searched through homes and businesses that were accessible for about six hours overnight, but were hampered by \u201climited access and lack of proper lighting,\u201d Evans said. A second set of teams were to resume search efforts in daylight.\n\nSeven people escaped a structure that collapsed in northwest Dallas, but Dallas Fire-Rescue were searching to see if anyone was left inside, Evans said. WFAA-TV reported that a convenience store collapsed in the storm, but the clerk told the station that everyone who was inside made it out safely.\n\nEvans said the department had also received multiple calls from people injured in their homes by broken glass.\n\nOn Twitter, Dallas Fire-Rescue said one of its own stations sustained significant damage during the storms overnight, and included photos that appeared to show a collapsed roof and debris. Evans said none of the firefighters at Station 41 were hurt, but said the roof was torn off by the high winds.\n\nA radio station, KNON-FM, went off the air as the studio suffered major damage from the tornado. Lew Morris, one of the hosts of \u201cReckless Rock Radio\u201d told The Associated Press in a Facebook message that the power at the station went out first, followed by the \u201cdistinctive whistle\u201d of a tornado within three minutes.\n\n\u201cWe then heard the building shaking and could hear the glass windows shattering everywhere along with debris banging around. We waited until all the noise died down,\u201d Morris told the AP. \u201cWe walked out to see the studio he was just broadcasting from destroyed.\u201d\n\nGodwin, the meteorologist, said the size and severity of the tornado won\u2019t be known until crews arrive to survey the damage. NWS warning coordination meteorologist Jennifer Dunn told the AP there may have been two or more tornadoes in north Texas, but reiterated that the extent wouldn\u2019t be known until later Monday afternoon.\n\nNorth of Dallas, the city of Richardson said in a release that many roads \u201cused by thousands of morning commuters\u201d will be closed while workers clear debris and repair downed traffic lights.\n\nThe city of Sachse, a northeast suburb of Dallas, said in a release that six houses were damaged from the storms, but no injuries were reported.\n\nCiting extensive damage to campuses, the Dallas Independent School District canceled Monday classes at six schools.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mallika Sen contributed from New York.", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Crews searched Monday through the rubble of buildings torn apart by a tornado that ripped through the Dallas area the night before, causing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/21/874c14_us-severe-weather-11673-oct-20-2019-image-video-by-twitter-user-athenarising-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
