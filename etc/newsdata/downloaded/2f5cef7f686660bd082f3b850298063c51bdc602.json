It found thousands of the tiny particles per cubic millimetre of tissue in every placenta analysed.\n\nThe link between exposure to dirty air and increased miscarriages, premature births and low birth weights is well established. The research suggests the particles themselves may be the cause, not solely the inflammatory response the pollution produces in mothers.\n\nDamage to foetuses has lifelong consequences and Prof Tim Nawrot at Hasselt University in Belgium, who led the study, said: \u201cThis is the most vulnerable period of life. All the organ systems are in development. For the protection of future generations, we have to reduce exposure.\u201d He said governments had the responsibility of cutting air pollution but that people should avoid busy roads when possible.\n\nA comprehensive global review concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. Nanoparticles have also been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and billions have been found in the hearts of young city dwellers.\n\nWhile air pollution is reducing in some nations, the evidence of harm caused by even low levels is rapidly increasing and 90% of the world\u2019s population live in places where air pollution is above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.\n\nRevealed: air pollution may be damaging 'every organ in the body' Read more\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined 25 placentas from non-smoking women in the town of Hasselt. It has particle pollution levels well below the EU limit, although above the WHO limit. Researchers used a laser technique to detect the black carbon particles, which have a unique light fingerprint.\n\nIn each case, they found nanoparticles on the foetal side of the placenta and the number correlated with air pollution levels experienced by the mothers. There was an average of 20,000 nanoparticles per cubic millimetre in the placentas of mothers who lived near main roads. For those further away, the average was 10,000 per cubic millimetre.\n\nThey also examined placentas from miscarriages and found the particles were present even in 12-week-old foetuses. The first report of possible pollution particles in placentas was presented at a conference in September 2018, though the composition of the particles had not been confirmed.\n\nThe detection of the particles on the foetal side of the placental barrier means it was very likely the foetuses were exposed, Nawrot said. Work to analyse foetal blood for particles is now under way, as is research to see if the particles cause DNA damage.\n\nThe team also found black carbon particles in the urine of primary school children. The study, published in 2017, found an average of 10 million particles per millilitre in hundreds of nine-to-12-year-olds tested. \u201cIt shows there is translocation of particles from the lungs to all organ systems,\u201d said Nawrot.\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult to give people practical advice, because everyone has to breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what people can do is avoid busy roads as much as possible. There can be very high levels next to busy roads, but just a few metres away can be lower.\u201d\n\nQ&A How does air pollution affect the human body? Show Hide Air pollution has been described as the \u2018new tobacco\u2019 by the head of the World Health Organization. Over 90% of the world\u2019s population suffers toxic air and research is increasingly revealing the profound impacts on the health of people, especially children. Children and babies\u2019 developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.\n\nA comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. In the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.\n\nDamian Carrington, Environment editor\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, whose group presented the first report of particles in five placentas in September, welcomed the research and said the group\u2019s work had since been expanded and would be published soon.\n\n\u201cWe see evidence of particles in all women \u2013 it is not like it is a one-off,\u201d said Grigg at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. \u201cIt implies that every day we have these very small particles moving around our bodies.\u201d\n\nAir pollution 'as bad as smoking in increasing risk of miscarriage' Read more\n\n\u201cWe should be protecting foetuses and this is another reminder that we need to get [air pollution] levels down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people shouldn\u2019t be totally scared.\u201d He said the total weight of the tiny particles was small and more research was needed to determine their impact, but he advised people to use lower pollution transport optionsor public transport, rather than cars.\n\nGrigg said: \u201cThis new field of research certainly focuses our attention on the direct role of particles getting to the tissues, rather than particles getting into the lungs and releasing other [inflammatory] substances.\u201d\n\nAir pollution research now shows full scale bodily harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and reduced intelligence to brittle bones and damaged skin. The WHO calls air pollution a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d and recent analysis indicates 8.8 million early deaths each year, though scientists suspect even this may be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d.", "description": "Research finds black carbon breathed by mothers can cross into unborn children", "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de672eb5b32edd9076b19854e230af180dffef2b/0_169_5249_3153/master/5249.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4234a8c67a3b6457c05c87e07ca96500", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
