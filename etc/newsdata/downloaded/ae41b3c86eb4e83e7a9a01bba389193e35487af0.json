A survey of business economists forecast growth at 2.3 percent this year followed by 1.8 percent in 2020 \u2014 far below Trump\u2019s campaign promise of 3 percent annual growth.\n\nAfter a major summer blow-up that led to a spike in tariffs, the Trump administration and China had spent much of September making goodwill gestures to set the tone for the October talks.\n\nBeijing began buying American soybeans, and Trump agreed to postpone planned tariff increases scheduled for Oct. 1.\n\nGary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said there may be an upside to the recent spat over security issues.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it, we\u2019re beginning to get the separation between normal trade issues and security issues,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump could even appoint separate negotiators for the security track.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration, he noted, has continuously intermingled the two issues, at times using security-related sanctions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei to influence the trade talks.\n\nAlthough the latest security moves lowered the odds of an across-the-board deal to end the trade war, separating out the security issues into their own track could lead to a successful, narrower deal.\n\n\u201cYou could say it has that silver lining, because there\u2019s a lot of trade that it\u2019s hard to argue is a security issue,\u201d Huffbauer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if a grand deal is possible in the next administration, but certainly not in this administration,\u201d he added.", "description": "The odds of a breakthrough in upcoming trade talks with China took a turn for the worse this week after the Trump administration imposed a slew of new sanctions on Beijing over alleged human rights abuses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pompeomike_100519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
