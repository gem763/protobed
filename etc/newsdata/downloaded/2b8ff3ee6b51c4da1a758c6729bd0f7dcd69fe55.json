Sign up here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve are prompting investors to bet the central bank will bow to political pressure and lower interest rates, according to a new study.\n\nTrump has frequently used social media to criticize the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for running rates higher than he thinks they should be. A review of such tweets and the market response by economists from Duke University and the London Business School found they have a \u201cstatistically significant and negative effect\u201d on markets.\n\nThe broadsides knocked a combined 10 basis points off the expected fed funds futures contract, the equivalent to about 0.30 basis points per Tweet, the study found.\n\n\u201cWe provide evidence that market participants believe that the Fed will succumb to the political pressure from the President, which poses a significant threat to central bank independence,\u201d Francesco Bianchi, Thilo Kind and Howard Kung said in a study published on Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe finding will likely disappoint the Fed, whose officials have long argued they don\u2019t take Trump\u2019s lobbying into account when setting monetary policy and that they act independently of politics.\n\nJust last week, the president accused the Fed of having \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision!\u201d despite it just having cut rates for the second time this year.\n\nTrump also recently asked whether Powell or China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, was \u201cour bigger enemy.\u201d In August, he pointed to Germany\u2019s sale of debt with negative yields to criticize Powell, saying the Fed board \u201cputs us at a disadvantage against our competition.\u201d He\u2019s also questioned \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome?\u201d despite being the one to nominate him.", "description": "Trump\u2019s Fed Tweets Shown to Have \u2018Significant\u2019 Effect on Trading", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic0ea327110c323b3783482f03574fa0b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
