It would have been forced to disclose key documents and decision-making related to the Iraq war.\n\nA mum-of-one now based in Turkey, she and her husband remained living in the shadow of GCHQ, the government eavesdropping centre in southern England where she had worked as a Mandarin translator, until 2011.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was just to go back to normal life, and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Gun said, who went on to work as a Mandarin tutor \u2014 even coaching former colleagues from GCHQ.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to come to terms with the events\u2026 every time I tried to recount (them), my stress levels would go up again.\u201d\n\nAnother central character in \u201cOfficial Secrets\u201d is Martin Bright, the journalist at The Observer newspaper who received the leaked memo and broke the story, and is played by actor Matt Smith.\n\n\u201cIt was immensely exciting,\u201d Bright recalled of the experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the journalist\u2019s equivalent of scoring a goal at Wembley \u2014 getting a front page news story in a Sunday newspaper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve subsequently felt that this is an extremely important story that risked being forgotten.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Questions about loyalty\u2019 \u2013\n\nGun said she was initially hesitant about getting involved in the film, fearing another false dawn after numerous failed attempts to make a movie about the dramatic events that have shaped the last 16 years of her life.\n\nBut after spending several days forensically recounting it all to Hood, a South African-born director whose other politically driven films include \u201cTsotsi\u201d (2005) and \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d (2015), both were convinced of the importance of the collaboration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling this story because I think it raises interesting questions about loyalty\u2026 to what and to whom do we owe our loyalty?\u201d the director said.\n\nPeople\u2019s loyalty should be to \u201cfundamental values as espoused by the American constitution and its bill of rights and if you step outside of those, you don\u2019t have my loyalty.\u201d\n\nFor Gun, the film reminds audiences of the apparent lack of accountability for Bush and Blair over the Iraq War, which caused immense suffering and eroded regional stability.\n\nShe also sees a correlation between this and the prevailing political culture in Britain and the US, where Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are frequently accused of dishonesty.\n\n\u201cIf they see that other people haven\u2019t been held to account, it sets an extremely bad example,\u201d Gun said.\n\n\u201cAnd human psychology says that you just emulate what you see.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 A British whistleblower responsible for a dramatic leak in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and now the subject of a Hollywood", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/3caf72_british-prime-minister-tony-blair-us-president-george-bush-dogged-by-criticism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
