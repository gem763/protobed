She had it valued thinking it was just an old religious icon.\n\nHere are three similar astonishing finds.\n\n\u2013 Caravaggio in the attic \u2013\n\nA painting thought to be a lost masterpiece by the Renaissance artist Caravaggio was found under an old mattress in the attic of a house in the French city of Toulouse in 2014.\n\n\u201cJudith and Holofernes\u201d, dated to 1606, depicts a biblical scene of the beautiful Jewish widow Judith beheading a sleeping Assyrian general.\n\nThe house owners discovered it while investigating a leak in the ceiling.\n\nAfter examining the piece for months, Eric Turquin, an art expert in Paris, authenticated the work as a Caravaggio. Most specialists agreed, though some in Italy had their doubts.\n\nEstimated at 100 to 150 million euros ($110 to $170 million), it was due to be auctioned in France in June 2019. But two days before the sale it was snapped up by an anonymous foreign buyer.\n\n\u2013 Rembrandt bargain \u2013\n\nIn 2016, a Dutch art dealer bought a portrait at a Christie\u2019s auction in London that he was convinced was an authentic Rembrandt, even though it was listed in the catalogue as coming only from the master\u2019s \u201ccircle.\u201d\n\nRembrandt expert Jan Six had travelled to London days before the auction to discreetly examine the \u201cPortrait of a Young Gentleman\u201d.\n\nUndated and unsigned, it shows a young man wearing a black cloak with a white lace ruffle in a style distinctive of Rembrandt, who died in 1669.\n\nSix bought the piece for 137,000 pounds ($175,000, or 160,000 euros), far below what a real Rembrandt would fetch.\n\nOn his return to Amsterdam, Six had the painting examined by other art historians, many of whom also believe it is a real Rembrandt.\n\n\u2013 Gauguin left on a train \u2013\n\nIn 2014, Italian police recovered from a pensioner a painting by French post-impressionist artist Paul Gauguin and another by his contemporary Pierre Bonnard, which were stolen from a house in London in 1970.\n\nGauguin\u2019s \u201cFruits on a Table\u201d (1889) and Bonnard\u2019s undated \u201cWoman with Two Chairs\u201d had been hanging in the retired Fiat factory worker\u2019s kitchen since he bought them at auction in 1975 for 45,000 lire, around 23 euros at the time.\n\nThe unsigned paintings had been auctioned \u2014 on the second try, because the first failed to attract any bidders \u2014 after being turned in at the Turin railway station as lost objects left on a train.\n\nOne of the buyer\u2019s sons recognised the styles of Gauguin and Bonnard after consulting catalogues.\n\nHe went to the police and investigations verified they were the stolen pieces.\n\nThe Gauguin was estimated to be worth 10 to 30 million euros and the Bonnard 600,000 euros.\n\nThey were returned to the Italian buyer, since they had been bought in good faith and the original owners had passed away, leaving no heirs.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 A 13th-century painting by the Italian master Cimabue that goes on auction Sunday, after being discovered in an ordinary home in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/1a1c4a_13th-century-painting-by-italian-master-cimabue-discovered-in-an-ordinary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
