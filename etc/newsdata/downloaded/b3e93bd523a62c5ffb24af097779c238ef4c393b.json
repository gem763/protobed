Airmen eligible for the Remote Combat Effects Campaign Medal would not have been physically exposed to hostile actions, the Air Force said.\n\nThe \u201cRemote Combat Effects Campaign Medal\u201d was established in May by then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson. It\u2019s part of a \u201ccontinuing effort to recognize U.S. Air Force military members in a non-deployed status who directly participated in a Department of Defense combat operation from a remote location,\u201d the Air Force said in a release announcing the decoration.\n\n\u201cOur remote operations community makes vital contributions to our national security and the security of our allies,\u201d Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said in a statement. \u201cThese airmen play a crucial role in every campaign we undertake and this medal is for them.\u201d\n\nAirmen can be awarded the medal for actions after Sept. 11, 2001. Anyone who has previously received a campaign medal or decoration for the same time period isn\u2019t eligible for the Remote Combat Effects Campaign Medal.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
