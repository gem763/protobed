That the evil National Rifle Association and all those evil gun rights groups were trying to drum up fears of confiscations that just weren\u2019t true.\n\nThat Democrats had no intention of taking away firearms from the legal gun owners. That if you like your gun, you can keep your gun.\n\nAnd for some, the left\u2019s talking points have been convincing. Particularly, as school shootings and tragic, heartbreaking stories of gun-related violence dominate far too many media cycles.\n\nThen comes Beto, charging to clarify.\n\n\u201cHell yes,\u201d we\u2019re going to confiscate.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more honest than that.\n\nThere\u2019s the golden ticket the NRA, the Republican Party, the patriotic Second Amendment supporters of this country needed to prove their argument, to prove their points, to showcase the truths about the Democrats\u2019 ultimate gun controlling end game.\n\nDemocrats want to confiscate guns, pure and simple. Beto O\u2019Rourke himself admitted it.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
