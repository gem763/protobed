Southwark Cathedral is used for many events and the Cathedral and the rooms associated with the Cathedral have been available for hire since c2000 when the Millennium buildings were built.\n\n\"The money generated by the hiring of the building is used towards the upkeep of the building, the costs of worship and music and enables the Cathedral to be open to the public free of charge.\"\n\nThe Independent has contacted Julien Macdonald for comment.", "description": "Southwark Cathedral has been accused of promoting superficial values after it hosted designer Julien Macdonald\u2019s London Fashion Week show.
