The result is a stark reminder of the dramatic ice-loss on the south side of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, one of the largest ice caps in Europe.\n\nThe project was led by Dr Kieran Baxter from the University of Dundee who spent two years working with the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Meteorological Office, who conduct glacier monitoring in the country.\n\n\u2018We have been working to produce images that are both engaging and easy to understand,\u2019 Dr Baxter said.\n\n\u2018It is important to show how climate change is physically and visibly affecting the region. To do this, we developed a novel process based on principles that are used by glaciologists to measure ice-volume loss.\u2019\n\nThe loss of the glacier as a result of climate change (PA)\n\nThe outline shows the original placement of the ice (PA)\n\n\u2018This method allows us to compose unique aerial views of past landscapes and to see how they have changed over the last 30 to 40 years. This period, which is within living memory for many people, has seen accelerated melt in Southeast Iceland.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlaciers photographed for the project include the Heinabergsj\u00f6kull glacier and the rapidly retreating Brei\u00f0amerkurj\u00f6kull glacier.\n\nDr Tomas Johannesson, Coordinator of Glaciological Research at the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said, \u2018Outreach about changes in the climate and the on-going downwasting of glaciers of Iceland has become increasingly important in our glaciological work at the Icelandic Meteorological Office in recent years.\n\n\u2018Our collaboration with Kieran Baxter and the University of Dundee is important for our public outreach and has proved effective to explain the changes that have occurred in recent decades.\n\n\u2018It is also important for our collaboration with the Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park and other organizations and agencies for the creation of educational material and exhibits about glaciers and glacier changes.\u2019\n\nEarlier this year, Iceland marked the first ever \u2018death\u2019 of a glacier because of climate change.\n\nThis level of ice loss is only set to continue (PA)\n\nClimate scientists as well as journalists and the UN\u2019s high commissioner on human rights attended an event to mark the passing of the Okjokull glacier.\n\nIceland\u2019s Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said: \u2018I hope this ceremony will be an inspiration, not only to us here in Iceland, but also for the rest of the world, because what we are seeing here is just one face of the climate crisis.\u2019\n\nA monument is unveiled at the site of Okjokull, Iceland\u2019s first glacier lost to climate change (AFP)\n\nThe plaque bears the inscription \u2018A letter to the future\u2019, and is intended to raise awareness about the decline of glaciers and the effects of climate change.\n\nIt also bears the label \u2018415 ppm CO2\u2019, referring to the record level of carbon dioxide measured in the atmosphere in May 2018.", "description": "Yet another reminder", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93218925_1572257476.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
