And in the Bronx in the 1980s in public school when somebody got caught or like called out by someone who told your business or like a teacher caught you, the room would be like, \u2018Ooh, busted.\u2019 And all I could hear in my mind last night [as] I was reading these texts was like my middle school cafeteria going like, \u2018Ooh, busted.\u2019 They\u2019re busted.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cBecause here\u2019s the thing, the texts unmask that they were up to no good, all right? They document what were essentially several quid pro quos that they were lining up. The Ukrainians had to deliver something tangible in exchange for Trump\u2019s support. It wasn\u2019t just a favor, as Trump phrases it. The quote is from one of the diplomats, \u2018I think the president really wants a deliverable.\u2019 But even more than that above the actual wrongdoing in the text the thing so damning about these texts is the consciousness of guilt that hangs over them.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Friday on MSNBC's \"All In,\" host Chris Hayes reacted to the text messages turned over by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker with other | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hayes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
