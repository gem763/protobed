The Springboks have won the other 13. The teams last met in November 2017 with South Africa winning 35-6.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nSpringboks coach Rassie Erasmus\n\n\"For us, this is a crunch game.\n\n\"And if we have to grind it out, this is a do-or-die game. Just beat Italy no matter how, even if it's just a drop goal.\n\n\"We want to get out of the pool. The win is the ultimate.\"\n\nItaly coach Conor O'Shea\n\n\"If you don't front up physically against South Africa, you've already lost the match.\n\n\"You must take them on in the forwards. We must treat it like the last match we'll ever play.\"\n\nWhat are the betting odds?\n\nSouth Africa to win: 1/100\n\nItaly to win: 16/1\n\nDraw: 50/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nSouth Africa are expected to win and win comfortably. However this is Italy's World Cup on the line. If they lose they are gone. Italy have prepared for this game for a long time but South Africa will have too much especially in the second half.\n\nPredicted score: South Africa 31 Italy 15", "description": "South Africa\u00a0vs Italy in both sides third match of the Rugby World Cup.
