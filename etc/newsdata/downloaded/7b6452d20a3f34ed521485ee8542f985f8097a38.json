Moreover, the microphone can be turned off, it said.\n\nRead more: From Alexa-powered smart glasses to a serious AirPods competitor: These are the 8 craziest and coolest new gadgets Amazon unveiled in an hours-long event on Wednesday\n\nUnlike Snap's Spectacles or Google's infamous $1,500 smart glasses, which were released in 2013 and caused a privacy backlash, Echo Frames do not have cameras to take photos or record videos.\n\nAmazon is touting this as a positive for privacy reasons, and it's also why the smart glasses weigh just over an ounce.\n\nBut privacy advocates have concerns about taking Alexa's recording capabilities to the streets.\n\nAmazon's Alexa home devices have already come under intense scrutiny.\n\nSome users found that their personal conversations had been recorded and then forwarded on to friends in error, and Bloomberg reported in April that Amazon workers had been listening back to recordings and mocking them online. In response, Amazon said it would be introducing a new feature on all its Alexa-enabled devices that would allow users to delete recordings.\n\nThe UK privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch said Amazon's record of privacy infractions with Alexa set a poor precedent for the Echo Frames.\n\n\"Amazon has a terrible record on privacy and is releasing endless 'smart' gadgets that constantly surveil their owners' private lives,\" said the group's director, Silkie Carlo, in a statement to Business Insider. \"Pitching these devices for people's homes is one thing, but encouraging people to wear listening devices all day is a step further.\"\n\nCarlo wouldn't comment on whether Amazon's glasses were at risk of conflicting with the European Union's privacy law GDPR, which requires any company that does business with EU citizens to get consent from people to use their data. \"I don't think we can answer it until the details and policies are published,\" she said. \"However, it is fair to describe it as a concern.\"\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nOther critics say that unlike the widely mocked, clunky Google Glass, Echo Frames could actually take off, meaning there could be a bunch of wearers walking around with always-on microphones about their person.\n\n\"Amazon's enormous surveillance infrastructure and a much less obtrusive design will make Echo Frames the *actual* public privacy nightmare that we were afraid Google Glass might become,\" one Twitter user wrote.\n\nShe added: \"and at $180?! Forget about it. These things could be everywhere.\"", "description": "Amazon\u00a0is releasing a pair of smart glasses with a built-in Alexa voice assistant, meaning you can talk to it anywhere, any time.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8c8bcf2e22af50b467545d-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
