Without the couple\u2019s knowledge, Island took a doll from a Family Dollar Store, according to a notice of claim dated June 12 that was filed by former Arizona attorney general Thomas Horne, who is representing Ames and Harper.\n\nA police patrol unit followed the couple\u2019s car. Once the family members entered their babysitter\u2019s apartment complex, an officer approached their vehicle with his weapon drawn and yanked open the front door, the claim said.\n\nDespite department rules that require police to wear body cameras, the Phoenix officers were not wearing them, the claim said. But passersby recorded the encounter. The police released one video over the summer, but there are others online.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put a cap in your a--,\u201d one officer said to Ames as a second policeman, whose weapon was also drawn and pointed at Ames, walked up to the car, the video shows. \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you in your f---ing face.\u201d\n\nBoth statements, Horne wrote in the claim, were made in front of the couple\u2019s children, who were in the back of the vehicle.\n\nWilliams pulled Ames, 22, from the car, pushed his head to the pavement, handcuffed him and yelled that Ames better follow orders, according to the claim. The officer threw Ames against a vehicle, ordered him to spread his legs and \u201ckicked him in the right leg so hard that the father collapsed.\u201d Then the officer dragged him upright and punched him in the back, the claim said.\n\nAD\n\nOnce Ames was handcuffed and inside the patrol vehicle, the officers focused their attention on Harper and the children, according to the claim.\n\nAD\n\nThe two officers pointed their weapons at the visibly pregnant 24-year-old Harper and her children, the video shows and the claim stated.\n\n\u201cThe first officer grabbed the mother and the baby around both of their necks, and tried to take the baby out of the mother\u2019s hand,\u201d the claim alleged. \u201cHe told her to put the baby on the ground, which she was unwilling to do because the baby could not walk, and the ground consisted of hot pavement.\u201d\n\nThe officer tried to rip Harper\u2019s youngest child from her arms, the claim stated. Eventually he threw Harper, who had handed the children to a bystander, into the police car face-first and then handcuffed her.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI could have shot you in front of your f---ing kids,\u201d he said, according to the claim.\n\nAfter video of the altercation went viral online, Williams launched an internal investigation and said she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by what happened. Mayor Kate Gallego said the officer\u2019s behavior was unacceptable and that \u201cseeing these children placed in such a terrifying situation is beyond upsetting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut in June, city officials disputed information in the couple\u2019s claim.\n\nIn a Facebook post, officials wrote that officers located the vehicle at an apartment complex about a mile away and claim the \u201cmale driver\u201d told officers he had stolen a package of underwear, which he had thrown out the window, and that he was driving with a suspended license. Police claim a woman in the vehicle said she believed the child stole the doll and that she heard officers tell \u201cthe driver to stop the car several times, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to police, no one was arrested for shoplifting because the store manager declined to prosecute.\n\nHorne denied the department\u2019s version of events at the time.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that are true and some we dispute,\u201d he told The Post in June. \u201cNone of the discrepancies affect the outrage as to the way the officers treated these people who never resisted and were always compliant.\u201d\n\nAfter officials announced Williams\u2019s dismissal, and that they had given a written reprimand to a second, unidentified officer, Horne called the move \u201cpartial justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo get full justice, the job is now mine to get it for them with compensation in the lawsuit,\u201d Horne said during a news conference. He had previously filed a $10 million civil claim against the City of Phoenix.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think the vast majority of police are fine public servants. In any group, whether it\u2019s lawyers, journalists or anybody else, you get some bad apples,\u201d Horne said, according to the Arizona Republic. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my job to be sure that justice is done when we do get these bad apples.\u201d\n\nAmes told the Republic that the incident had left his family traumatized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been real bad. It\u2019s hard to get over that type of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very tragic and traumatizing moment. So to know that he\u2019s been fired is some type of little relief, but there\u2019s still a lot to work on.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Officers followed a car to an apartment complex, roughed up the parents while children watched, and were not wearing body cameras as required.
