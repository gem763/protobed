Now impeachment investigators are interested in him", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The White House is confirming Donald Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate his country's role in meddling in the 2016 US presidential campaign. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said withholding funding was \"absolutely appropriate.\" (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Tuesday that his close involvement in Ukraine issues would not cause him to recuse himself from a Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI represent the people that elected me. Those individuals deserve a voice and my vote in the process. I would never even consider it,\u201d Johnson said of recusal, speaking in a brief interview at the U.S. Capitol with the Journal Sentinel.\n\nJohnson also said he would be happy to provide his first-hand knowledge of events and conversations involving Ukraine to U.S. House members conducting the impeachment probe, which centers on the question of whether Trump improperly pushed Ukraine officials to investigate Trump\u2019s Democratic political rival, Joe Biden, and Democratic activities in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThat would be up to the House\u201d if it wants to hear from him, Johnson said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t resist. I\u2019m always happy to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he has not sought legal representation to deal with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe senior senator from Wisconsin has taken on a unique role in the impeachment saga, largely because of his own close involvement with Ukraine issues, as chair of the foreign relations subcommittee on Europe and as a member of the Senate\u2019s bipartisan Ukraine Caucus. That placed him in conversations and meetings that are being scrutinized by House investigators. As a senator, he has also looked into unproven claims that Ukraine assisted Democrats in the 2016 election.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, left, meets with U.S. Sens.

In a Sept. 5 tweet promoting the visit, the embassy tweeted Johnson and Murphy \"underscored strong U.S. support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Euro-Atlantic integration.\" (Photo: Embassy of the United States of America, Kiev)\n\nHouse Democrats on the three investigative committees (Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs) say they are open to hearing from Johnson, though they were cautious about how to request the testimony of a fellow member of Congress.\n\n\"Let's put it this way, it would be nice to have more explanation from and about Ron Johnson's activities with respect to Ukraine,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., a member of the House Oversight Committee. \"What was his role? What did he see as his role? And what did he do? And why did he do it?\"\n\nMore: House resolution outlines public phase of impeachment inquiry, gives GOP subpoena powers\n\nMore: 'Everybody has read your words on the call': Pelosi responds to Trump tweets on impeachment\n\nWhen asked whether Johnson would be called to testify or provide information or documents, Connolly hesitated, pausing for 10 seconds before answering.\n\n\"That becomes a real challenge, both in protocol and in even separation of roles between the two bodies in the legislature, so I hesitate to assert confidently that he can or would be requested to testify,\" he said. \"I mean I think it is desirable voluntarily to invite him to answer some obvious questions that have been raised. It's a different matter compelling a sitting United States Senator to testify before the House.\"\n\nHe said more information was needed in order to say definitively whether Johnson should recuse himself from the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"I mean, if he were as involved as Giuliani. I would answer your question, absolutely -- huge conflict of interest,\" Connolly said. \"If his role were more peripheral -- much more peripheral -- than it becomes a real gray area and ultimately, maybe his decision to make.\"\n\nOther Democrats, and even one Republican, expressed openness to hearing from Johnson.\n\n\"I'm interested in hearing about anybody who wants to come forward,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., who also sits on Oversight.\n\nHe said it would be up to Johnson whether or not to come forward.\n\nForeign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, a Democrat, also expressed interest in Johnson.\n\n\"I'm happy to hear what he has to say. I'm happy to hear what anybody has to say,\" he said, adding he was not sure whether Johnson would actually be called.\n\nRep. Val Demings, D-Fla. and a member of both the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees \u2014 said she may want Johnson to appear.\n\n\u201cIf his name keeps coming up then we definitely want to hear from him,\u201d she said of Johnson.\n\nJohnson attended the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and met and spoke with Trump about Zelensky and US military aid to Ukraine put on hold by Trump. The senator lobbied Trump to release the aid and also approached the president when he heard from a US diplomat that release of the aid was tied to Ukraine\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations Trump sought into the 2016 elections.\n\nJohnson said he was troubled by any linkage or \"quid pro quo\" but satisfied when Trump denied to him personally that the aid was tied to political investigations. The senator also met this summer with Ukraine diplomat Andrii Telizhenko about unsubstantiated claims Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.\n\nSome experts and analysts have raised the question of whether Johnson should recuse himself from a Senate impeachment trial because he is a first-hand witness to key conversations.\n\n\u201cYou don't have somebody be a witness in a trial and then serve on the jury,\u201d said Hui Chen, an attorney who has worked on compliance issues for the U.S. Department of Justice, Microsoft and Pfizer.\n\nChen is also a research fellow at Rutgers School of Law\u2019s Center for Government Compliance and Ethics\n\nRyan Goodman, a professor at New York University School of Law who served as special counsel to the U.S. Department of Defense under President Barack Obama, called Johnson a \u201cfact witness,\u201d and \"as such the appropriate thing for him to do may be to recuse himself from the Senate trial.\u201d\n\nWhile he was a strong backer of U.S. aid to Ukraine, Johnson also has emerged as a vocal defender of Trump's conduct toward Ukraine.\n\nBut in an interview last month, Johnson said that if there is an impeachment trial in the Senate, \u201cI will approach it very seriously. I will respect the other house of Congress. If they vote articles of impeachment, we\u2019ll take it up in the Senate. I will listen to the case very respectfully. I will not prejudge anything.\u201d\n\nPatrick Marley and Molly Beck of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/ron-johnson-and-ukraine-senator-not-recuse-himself/2500474001/", "description": "Sen.
