Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has so far refused to share any details of the complaint with lawmakers, leading to an outcry among Democrats.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democratic California Congressman, praised the whistleblower for coming forward after a closed hearing with Mr Atkinson on Thursday.\n\nHe also accused the White House and Justice Department of intervening to block the complaint from being shared with Congress.\n\n\"I believe that there is an effort to prevent this information getting to Congress,\" said Mr Schiff.\n\n\"And if the assertion is accurate... then at one level or another, it likely involves either the president or people around him.\"\n\nTrump vs spies\n\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter\n\nMany of those who work in the US intelligence services don't trust Trump. They don't think that he can keep a secret (he apparently revealed classified information to Russians in the Oval Office), and they don't like the way he talks about them (in a tweet about a news leak, he compared them to Nazis).\n\nThe controversy over the president's \"promise\" to a foreign leader during a phone call - and a whistleblower complaint about the matter - is a reminder of the acrimonious relationship between the president and those who work in the intelligence services.\n\nYet like much of what happens in the world of intelligence, the matter is shrouded in mystery. It's still unclear whom the president spoke to, for example, or what he said. In this case, though, some of these questions will be addressed during a House intelligence committee scheduled for next week, and more information may be available to the public.\n\nAs Trump himself would say: stay tuned.", "description": "US media report that his comments to an unnamed foreign leader sparked a formal complaint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/317B/production/_108876621_gettyimages-1169369082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
