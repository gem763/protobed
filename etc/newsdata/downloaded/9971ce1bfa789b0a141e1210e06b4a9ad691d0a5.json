Cutoffs began after midnight local time Wednesday, with the first phase impacting about 513,000 customers, as hot, dry winds were forecast to pick up speed.\n\nAltogether, more than 2 million people may be affected, based on city estimates and the average size of a U.S. household. The city of San Francisco was outside of the shutoff zone as of Tuesday.\n\nNever before has a utility planned such a widespread shutoff affecting so many customers at once to avoid a wildfire in California. It\u2019s the latest testament to how climate change-driven extreme weather is forcing people and businesses alike to adapt. This week\u2019s outage will mark the first time PG&E has coordinated a blackout in a major metropolitan area. Previous ones involved rural areas prone to wildfires.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David R.
