Pat Roberts, Kansas Republican.\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday said they inched closer to proving a White House plot to hold up Ukrainian military aid for political aims, though any move to impeach Mr. Trump would go to the GOP-controlled Senate for trial. Two-thirds of the Senate must vote to convict Mr. Trump for him to be removed from office \u2014 and so far, there is little indication that the needed 20 Senate Republicans are willing to make such a drastic break from the president.\n\nMr. Trump says House Democrats want to impeach him as \u201cquickly as possible\u201d because they cannot win in 2020 and see it as their only option. But he\u2019s made his disgust with impeachment and would-be turncoats plain, saying Republicans must not allow Democrats to run roughshod over him.\n\n\u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet that shocked many in Washington for its use of the word \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal from Syria and about-face on the G7 summit were already tying Republicans in knots, and his chief of staff appeared to undercut a key GOP talking point on a possible quid pro quo involving the aid to Ukraine.\n\nHis decision to describe his plight as a \u201clynching,\u201d a practice that evokes horrific crimes against black Americans in the South, forced Republicans to defend the president once again. In doing so, it exposed the grab bag of approaches Republicans are using to show loyalty while insulating themselves from the thornier aspect of backing an unpredictable president.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would have used different language, while Senate Republicans said they\u2019re leery of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior but that it\u2019s not impeachable.\n\nOthers backed the president forcefully, calling his \u201clynching\u201d tweet apt.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete sham and a joke, and if that term \u2018political lynching\u2019 bothers you, I\u2019m sorry, call it a sham proceeding. I really don\u2019t care, it\u2019s the conduct,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally. \u201cThe point is what\u2019s happening in the House is unfair, it\u2019s a political sham, it\u2019s a kangaroo court, it is a mob taking over, it is what happened to [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh \u2014 you\u2019re guilty unless you can prove yourself innocent.\u201d\n\nPressed on the racial overtones around the term \u201clynching,\u201d Mr. Graham said he was from South Carolina and did not need the reminder.\n\n\u201cI am saying that lynching throughout history has been conducted against African Americans, but lynching throughout history has been conducted against people you don\u2019t like \u2014 when mobs take over because of the color of your skin, your religious background and sometimes politically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t trying to draw comparisons to minorities who\u2019ve been murdered.\n\n\u201cThe president is not comparing what\u2019s happened to him with one of the darkest moments in American history. He\u2019s just not,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s explaining clearly is the way he\u2019s been treated by the media since he announced for president.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric against the backdrop of a fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\nA U.S. diplomat, William Taylor, offered damning testimony behind closed doors on Tuesday. Democrats described it as detailed and revelatory, potentially accelerating their push to impeach Mr. Trump over an alleged \u201cquid pro quo\u201d involving Ukraine.\n\nSenate Republicans discussed some of the rules surrounding impeachment during a conference luncheon Tuesday but did not discuss a timeline, according to Sen. John N. Kennedy, Louisiana Republican.\n\n\u201cMy personal feeling is that the speaker, she\u2019s on her fifth try \u2014 she tried collusion, she tried conspiracy, she tried Stormy Daniels, she tried taxes, she tried emoluments clause, and now they\u2019re trying this,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told reporters. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way most Americans see it whether they agree with it or not.\u201d\n\nHis depiction of the impeachment push as a see-what-sticks endeavor aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s view on the matter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through the impeachment now since the beginning on Russia, on Mueller, on all this stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity late Monday.\n\nMr. Trump said Republicans need to stick together like the Democrats do, pointing to the lack of \u201cMitt Romneys\u201d on the other side. He singled out Mr. Romney, Utah Republican, because the former presidential nominee has become a nemesis of sorts on various issues.\n\nWhether Senate Republicans hold ranks remains to be seen, but Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, told reporters there seems to be some Republicans who never stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump.\n\n\u201cLook there are a couple of individuals in the Republican Party who never did care for Trump; I\u2019m on the other side of that,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said. \u201cIt\u2019d be better if we were united but this is a political situation, I\u2019ve never seen everyone united on some of the things.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump says if Republicans don\u2019t stick together now, it could poison the well for all presidents.\n\n\u201cSome day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHis argument was overshadowed, however, by use of the term \u201clynching\u201d in the same tweet.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, California Democrat, said the comments exuded ignorance and will further harm Mr. Trump\u2019s standing with the black community.\n\n\u201cOf course, he has no understanding of this horrific history, I assume. And for him to say something like that was disgusting,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cIt hurts. It\u2019s painful, and he should apologize.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
