As WWD reports, the show\u2019s notes described the collection as a reimagined dressing for a working person\u2019s lifestyle: \u201cpower dressing, no matter what one does as a job.\u201d While the collection had the sorts of pieces one typically thinks of in relation to business wear \u2014 blazers, suits, and sheath dresses \u2014 they were all accompanied by overemphasized features, like huge, angular shoulders and cartoony, oversized cuts. Other non-workwear items included enormous ballgowns that bobbed whimsically down the runway and humongous puffer jackets that dwarfed the shoulders of the models who wore them.\n\nBut there was one detail, not seen in the clothes, that was hard to overlook. The exaggerated elements of the pieces had also extended to the beauty component: Models sported prosthetic facial makeup that resembled extreme cheek implants and enlarged lips, while others had more hollowed-out cheeks.\n\nPhoto: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nPhoto: Estrop/Getty Images\n\nWhether the prosthetics could be a comment on the continuously rising popularity of modern cosmetic treatments, or a nod to the belief in some cultures that prominent cheekbones are a sign of power and authority, or even an homage to Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nBalenciaga\u2019s creative director, Demna Gvasalia, told WWD that the collection was about dressing in a uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s like fashion as uniform to me,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, I try to imagine and to kind of create this aesthetic uniform.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nStay in touch.
