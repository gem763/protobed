And it's a question that's troubled her attorneys for years.\n\nRichardson is charged with aggravated murder and involuntary manslaughter. She is accused of deliberately killing her baby and burying her in the backyard.\n\n\u201cI tried to cremate the baby,\u201d Richardson said after a police interview in 2017.\n\nThis was the second time police spoke to her, and this interview would ultimately lead to her arrest.\n\nVideo of the interview, which is several hours long, hasn\u2019t been played in court yet. But Assistant Prosecutor Julie Kraft read a transcript of part of the recording when Richardson\u2019s father walked into the interview room.\n\n\u201cHoney, tell us what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson, who was 18 at the time, had denied burning her baby several times before that. She also denied deliberately killing her baby.\n\nHer attorneys say she delivered a stillborn child and buried her in the backyard because she didn\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nMultiple live video feeds inside the media room show Brooke More\n\nProsecutors say she killed her baby, burned her and buried her to hide the evidence. Richardson attended high school prom a few days before giving birth, and she didn\u2019t want anyone to know she was pregnant.\n\nIn a police report detailed in court, a detective wrote Richardson lit her baby\u2019s foot on fire with a lighter. The flames flared up to the baby\u2019s chest before Richardson put them out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s silly,\u201d said Charlie H. Rittgers, her attorney.\n\nA forensic pathologist who conducted the baby\u2019s autopsy testified on Friday. Rittgers often raised his voice and grew frustrated while questioning her.\n\nHe was mad because this doctor was a critical witness for the defense.\n\nBack in 2017, about two months after Richardson buried her baby in the backyard, her OB-GYN called police. Authorities interviewed Richardson and asked her questions about umbilical cords, abortions and placentas.\n\n\u201cI never meant to hurt her,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t alive,\u201d she said.\n\nPolice let her go. But they searched her home and dug up the skeletal remains of her baby. The bones were put in a small body bag and taken to the morgue.\n\nOfficials grouped the bones in different categories and eventually put the child back together. When inspecting the rib bones, a forensic anthropologist noticed the ends of the bones were darker than the rest. The police were called, again.\n\nThis time, they were told Richardson\u2019s baby had been burned.\n\nHer attorneys said this suggestion turned the case into something much more sinister than it actually was. It also sent authorities back to Richardson, where they were desperate to obtain a confession, Rittgers said.\n\nAnd they did.\n\nRichardson\u2019s attorneys say it was a false one, made by a scared teenager who struggles with an eating disorder and just told police what they wanted to hear.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why Assistant Prosecutor Kraft read a portion of Richardson\u2019s interview after police left her. Without being asked anything by police, the teenager said she tried to cremate her child.\n\nShe was talking to her dad.\n\nBut Richardson\u2019s attorney said she had already been broken by then. She had told police she might have squeezed her baby too hard, the baby cried and the baby might have been alive for five minutes.\n\nSkylar Richardson: Former cheerleader accused of killing her newborn baby\n\nShe also said the baby gurgled, which Rittgers called ridiculous. The attorney said babies that young can't gurgle.\n\nIn court on Friday, photos of the baby\u2019s bones and reconstructed skeleton were displayed on a television screen a few feet away from Richardson.\n\nShe shook while looking at them.\n\nContributing: Sonia Chopra, CIncinatti Enquirer.
