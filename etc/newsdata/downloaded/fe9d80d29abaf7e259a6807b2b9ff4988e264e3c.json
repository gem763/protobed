And now that Google\u2019s latest flagships are about to go on sale, all the usual smartphone suspects \u2013 yes, I\u2019m looking at you Apple and Samsung \u2013 have now weighed in, leaving it up to consumers to determine this fall\u2019s winner.\n\nOn the surface and pending hands-on tests, the newest Google hardware stacks up handsomely against the newest iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones. Pixel 4 ($799-up) and Pixel 4 XL ($899-up) have 5.7-inch and 6.3-inch displays, respectively, with fast (90Hz) refresh rates.\n\nGoogle is using machine learning to seemingly improve what has already been a Pixel strength: photography. And as the first phone with a radar sensor \u2013 that\u2019s what Google is claiming anyway \u2013 you can use motion gestures to control the device.\n\nTexting or e-mail: Which gives you more secure communication?\n\n'Fortnite': You can play the online video game again with arrival of 'Chapter 2'\n\nBoth models have dual rear cameras, included a 2x telephoto lens, housed in square configurations on both. But software is also critical, and Google is applying machine learning to help you better approximate what your final shot will look like, based on what you see in the viewfinder.\n\nMachine learning also helps portrait mode, as well as Pixel\u2019s impressive dim-light Night Sight technology. That feature is so improved, Google claims, that you\u2019ll be able to capture the Big Dipper in fine detail. (For the really best shots you\u2019d still need a tripod).\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 design. (Photo: Josmar Taveras)\n\nMeanwhile, via the aforementioned radar sensor and a feature Google calls Motion Sense, a mere wave of the hand can silence incoming phone calls or let you skip to the next track in a playlist.\n\nGoogle also uses Motion Sense for its version of facial recognition, which like Apple\u2019s FaceID, lets you use your mug to unlock the device. Google claims its approach is faster, although how fast and accurate it will turn out to be remains to be seen.\n\nAncestry adds health: Ancestry launches DNA health service that will compete with 23andMe\n\nAesthetically, Google is raising a question: Is orange the new black? That\u2019s because \u201cOh So Orange,\u201d in limited quantities is one of the new colors Google is offering. No need to fret if orange isn\u2019t your favorite hue, however. You can also choose among more traditional \u201cclearly white\u201d or \u201cjust black\u201d models.\n\nGone is the visor design on the back of prior Pixels that was frankly getting tired. Other details worth noting: The phone water-resistant and is among the first to run Android 10, the latest version of Google\u2019s mobile operating system. Alas, there is no standard headphone jack.\n\nAnd Google, like Apple, has decided to hold off on producing a next generation 5G handset for now \u2013 no surprise since 5G coverage is so limited still.\n\nGoogle has opened up the Pixel to all the major U.S. carriers this time around. Prior versions only were available initially as Verizon exclusives.\n\nAlso among the new features in the phones is one that has me especially jazzed: a Recorder app that can transcribe words in real time, a potential boon for students attending lectures, businesspeople in frequent meetings, and \u2013 journalists conducting interviews. It even works in airplane mode.\n\nIn the coming days, we\u2019ll put the new Pixels through the test.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/15/google-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl-new-phones-challenge-apple-samsung/3983338002/", "description": "At first look, the new Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL stack up handsomely against the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones.", "authors": ["Edward C.
