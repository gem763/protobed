(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nA mob enforcer doesn\u2019t have to say \u201cpay up, or we will destroy your store\u201d to be guilty of extortion. The message is conveyed clearly enough if he says \u201cnice store, shame if anything happened to it\u201d combined with the storekeeper\u2019s knowledge of what the mafia has done to those who didn\u2019t pay up.\n\nLikewise, President Trump did not have to say to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, \u201cAccuse Joe Biden of corruption, or you\u2019ll never see any more aid from the United States.\u201d It was sufficient that, according to the Wall Street Journal, in a July 25 call, Trump badgered Zelensky eight times to investigate Biden, before also withholding $250 million in military aid. The Ukrainians got the message whether the quid pro quo was explicitly laid out. As a Ukrainian official told the Daily Beast, \u201cClearly, Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the full details because of White House stonewalling, but from what we already know, this may be the most shocking revelation of wrongdoing by Trump since he fired FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9, 2017, (by his own admission) to squelch the investigation of his Russia ties. In 2016, candidate Trump implored a foreign power to interfere in the U.S. election on his behalf (\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u2026\u201d). In 2019, Trump appeared to use the full power of his office to extort a foreign leader to intervene in the next U.S. election on his behalf. The latter is far more egregious than the former. It is hard to imagine a more glaring example of a \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor.\u201d\n\nIf there were any justice in the world, this would mark a turning point where Democrats find the courage to impeach and Republicans find the decency to stop defending the indefensible. Instead, so far we are getting a rerun of previous scandals characterized by Trump\u2019s brazenness, Republicans\u2019 servility and Democrats\u2019 pusillanimity.\n\nTrump effectively admitted on Sunday that he told Zelensky to investigate the Democratic front-runner. But he argued, with typical illogic, that the scandal is an invention of the \u201cLameStream Media.\u201d He accused the whistleblower of spying on him and claims to be a victim of the \u201cDemented Deep State\u201d \u2014 even though the inspector general who found the allegations credible and urgent is himself a Trump appointee. Trump then doubled down on the spurious accusations of corruption against Biden, which have been reviewed and refuted by Ukrainian authorities and independent journalists, thereby using this as another opportunity to put the smears into public circulation.\n\nTrump\u2019s consigliere, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has the gall to compare Biden to Vice President Spiro Agnew, who resigned after being accused of bribery, extortion and tax evasion. Like Joseph McCarthy\u2019s \u201csecret list\u201d of communists in the State Department, Giuliani insists he has documentation for his lies but will not release it. Both Trump and Giuliani know that the utter falsity of their slanders doesn\u2019t matter: As long as they say it, some people will believe it, and others will shrug in frustration and say they don\u2019t know what to believe.\n\nTrump\u2019s sleazy lies are faithfully amplified by his lickspittle surrogates in the Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and in Congress, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nThen there is the right-wing media machine. As Media Matters for America summarized, Fox News has alternatively ignored Ukraine-gate, denounced it as \u201cpure nonsense,\u201d claimed it was an attempt to distract from Trump\u2019s stellar record, attacked the whistleblower as a \u201cdeep state \u2026 punk\u201d and even praised Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky as an example of the president\u2019s brilliant negotiating style.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the dumbest spin of all came from Trump\u2019s de facto minister of propaganda, Sean Hannity, who suggested that Trump\u2019s actions paled in comparison to President Barack Obama, who was caught on an open mic in 2012 telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more \u201cflexibility\u201d to make deals after the election. Yes, this would be an exact analogue to what Trump did \u2014 if Obama had said, \u201cI\u2019ll show more flexibility if you give me some dirt on Mitt Romney.\u201d But he didn\u2019t.\n\nTo think that Republicans bitterly criticized Obama for having supposedly betrayed the American people. Now most of them (Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is an honorable exception) have fallen strategically silent when it\u2019s imperative to stand up for the rule of law against the most corrupt president in our history \u2014 Richard M. Nixon and Warren Harding included.\n\nAs long as Democrats do not proceed with impeachment \u2014 and perhaps even if they do \u2014 Trump has made clear that he will continue his all-out assault on the Constitution. And Republicans \u2014 who congratulate themselves on their alleged devotion to the Constitution \u2014 will not do anything about it except to cheer him on.\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorge T.
