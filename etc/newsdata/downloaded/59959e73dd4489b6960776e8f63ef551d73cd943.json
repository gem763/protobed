That\u2019s not a good sign.", "language": "en", "text": "MarketWatch See if you can spot the moment when investors first lost faith in a China deal and started stockpiling cash.\n\nInvestors are moving more and more money to cash in a sign of mounting skepticism about the ability of financial markets and the economy to deliver more growth.\n\nAn analysis from research firm DataTrek, drawing on fund flow data from the Investment Company Institute, shows that there was $3.4 trillion in U.S. money market funds as of October 2. That\u2019s about 14% higher than at the end of 2018, and has risen nearly every week since May.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s strange about this recent influx of capital is that short-term rates have been declining all year,\u201d DataTrek founder Nicholas Colas wrote. Money market funds \u201care seeing strong inflows in 2019 even as 2-year yields have been cut in half,\u201d he added.\n\nSee: This ETF became a \u2018success story\u2019 by offering a little yield in a falling-rate world\n\nWith so many hurdles for markets over the coming weeks, higher defensive positioning is more likely a red flag than a trading strategy, Colas noted.\n\n\u201cInvestors are cautious about longer-term financial assets, likely due to macro uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome market commentators are calling this \u2018dry powder\u2019 for a late-year market rally. Perhaps, but we\u2019ll have to get through upcoming US-China trade talks and the Fed\u2019s October 30 meeting first.\u201d\n\nIndeed, May was when U.S.-China trade talks first hit the skids and the two countries started to slap tariffs on each other. And those aren\u2019t the only headwinds facing markets. Consider: an increasingly chaotic Brexit situation, intensifying impeachment proceedings against President Trump, third-quarter U.S. corporate earnings likely to be lackluster, skirmishes in the Mideast, and on and on.\n\nRelated: All that glitters might be just what your portfolio needs now\n\nIf the big shift to cash isn\u2019t enough of a signal, there are other signs investors are girding for a waning economic cycle, if not an outright downturn.\n\nReal estate, utilities, and consumer staples ETFs picked up the most money over the past month, Colas noted, gaining $1.4 billion, $755 million, and $472 million, respectively, while health care, industrials, and materials have been the biggest losers, with outflows of $1 billion, $496 million, and $434 million.\n\n\u201cThe sudden increase in money market fund assets this year bears watching since it is a sign of investor risk aversion,\u201d Colas concluded.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how to play the trade war with ETFs", "description": "Flows into money market funds have increased nearly every week since U.S.-China trade deals hit their first serious roadblock back in May, another sign of...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS837_DJIAYT_ZG_20191008092458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
