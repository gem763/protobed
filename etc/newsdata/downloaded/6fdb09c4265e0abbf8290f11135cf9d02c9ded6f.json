There, in a \u201cdead-end tunnel,\u201d Trump said, the militant leader detonated an explosive vest, killing himself and three of what were believed to be his at least six children.\n\nThe high-risk operation brings a dramatic end to a years-long hunt for the man who spearheaded the Islamic State\u2019s transformation from an underground insurgent band to a powerful quasi-state that straddled two countries and spawned copycat movements across several continents.\n\nAt its peak, the Islamic State controlled an area the size of Great Britain, boasting a massive military arsenal and a formidable financial base it used to threaten the West and brutalize those under its control. While the group gradually lost territory to U.S.-backed Syrian and Iraqi fighters, officials cautioned that it remains a potent insurgent force, even after Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\nOfficials said U.S. intelligence had tracked the militant leader, a onetime academic and veteran jihadist who spent a year in a U.S.-run prison in Iraq, to a redoubt in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, a restive area near the border with Turkey that is home to an array of extremist groups. A critical piece of information on Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts came from a disaffected Islamic State militant who became an informant for the Kurds working with the Americans, according to a U.S. official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive operation.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), whose troops have fought alongside U.S. forces, indicated that they had provided intelligence for the operation.\n\n\u201cFor five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Bagdadi,\u201d its commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, said on Twitter.\n\nTrump has been accused of abandoning the Kurds following a decision to pull back most U.S. forces in northern Syria who had provided a deterrent against Turkish forces threatening an attack from across the border. Officials on Sunday suggested that Baghdadi\u2019s death would not affect plans to curtail, or at least alter, the military mission in Syria.\n\nA senior official from Iraq\u2019s intelligence service, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, said the arrests and interrogation of people close to Baghdadi also helped yield his location, information that was provided to the Americans.\n\nU.S. intelligence is tracking six Islamic State individuals in the line of succession to Baghdadi, the U.S. official said. It\u2019s as though Baghdadi were the CEO and the six were his \u201cexecutive VPs,\u201d the official said.\n\nThey are dispersed, but U.S. intelligence \u201cgenerally\u201d knows where they are. The hope is that intelligence gleaned from the material recovered in the raid will help U.S. forces \u201croll up . . . the leadership cadre\u201d in the coming months.\n\nThe ideal time to act is when the leadership ranks are in chaos, as they are now, the official said, and militants\u2019 likely movements or communications provide opportunities to target them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep picking away,\u201d the official added.\n\nVice President Pence, speaking to CBS, said he and Trump were first informed on Thursday of the likelihood that Baghdadi would be at the target site, which the United States had been monitoring for some time. The president authorized the mission on Saturday morning. Officials said that two U.S. service members were lightly wounded in the operation and that additional militants were killed, including two women \u2014 identified as Baghdadi\u2019s wives \u2014 who were wearing explosive vests.\n\nThe raid comes as the United States scrambles to adjust its posture in Syria in the wake of Trump\u2019s declaration earlier this month that he would pull out nearly all of the approximately 1,000 troops in Syria amid a Turkish offensive against Syrian Kurdish troops who have been the Pentagon\u2019s main battlefield partner there. But evolving plans now call for a larger residual force that could mean a substantial ongoing campaign.\n\nIt also comes as the president faces impeachment proceedings over his role in withholding military aid to Ukraine and as the campaign for the 2020 presidential election intensifies.\n\nNational security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, speaking to NBC, said it was \u201ca good day for the United States, for our armed forces, and for the president.\u201d\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump thanked Syrian Kurdish forces and nations including Russia and Turkey.\n\n\u00a9 Al-Furqan Media/Afp Via Getty Im/Al-Furqan Media/Afp Via Getty Im A video from the Islamic State group broadcast on April 29 shows its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an undisclosed location.\n\nSenior officials later sought to minimize the significance of Trump\u2019s mention of Russia, saying the United States had a requirement to consult with Moscow, which is an important backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and operates air defense systems in Syria, to ensure the safety of U.S. troops.\n\nTrump described a harrowing operation that involved firefights before and after U.S. personnel, ferried in under the cover of darkness in eight helicopters, touched down in Idlib province. While the intent of the operation had been to capture Baghdadi, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told CNN, he moved underground when U.S. forces called on him to surrender, where he detonated his device.\n\nOfficials said the military had taken DNA samples from Baghdadi\u2019s remains and had quickly conducted visual and DNA tests to determine his identity. Nearly a dozen children were removed from the site, Trump said. It was not clear where they were taken.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward running and crying,\u201d he said.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s actions during the operation could not be immediately verified.\n\nA second official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details, said that troops from Delta Force, an elite military unit, conducted the operation from a base in Iraq with support from the CIA and Kurdish forces.\n\nThe DNA material needed to identify Baghdadi was voluntarily provided by one of his daughters, the official said.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to mark a major foreign policy achievement, reiterating his claims of having single-handedly defeated the Islamic State and making no mention of the Obama administration\u2019s steps to set in motion the campaign that culminated in a series of ground battles that deprived the Islamic State of territory and cash.\n\nEsper, in a separate interview with ABC, praised Trump for making the \u201cbold decision\u201d to authorize the raid and said U.S. forces had rehearsed for several weeks.\n\nRussia immediately cast doubt on the sense of triumph in Washington.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the number of direct participants and countries, which have allegedly joined this \u2018operation,\u2019 each of them with totally contradictory details, cause well-grounded questions and doubts that it has really been carried out, and that, what\u2019s more, it has been successful,\u201d said the Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nTrump praised his military and intelligence officials for the operation, which he said he watched from the White House Situation Room on Saturday evening \u2014 following a round of golf in the afternoon \u2014 with Pence, Esper, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior officials. News that Baghdadi was killed \u2014 announced as \u201cjackpot,\u201d from the commander on the ground, according to O\u2019Brien \u2014 came around 7:15 p.m. Trump issued a tweet two hours later after U.S. helicopters touched down in Iraq, writing, \u201cSomething very big has just happened.\u201d\n\nIn describing the importance of Baghdadi\u2019s death, Trump named American citizens whose executions by the Islamic State first pulled the United States into a military operation against the group, including James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig. Pence said the Pentagon leadership had named the operation after Kayla Mueller, an American who died in Islamic State custody and whom U.S. officials have said was repeatedly raped by Baghdadi.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s extremist reign, many more Iraqis and Syrians were killed or brutalized. Militants also enslaved women and children from Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority.\n\nThe operation served as a reminder of the grim series of events set off by the rise of the Islamic State, and the sophisticated global propaganda and recruitment network that enabled. Among the high-profile acts of global violence the group inspired were the 2015 attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. The group also used its financial and political power to establish foreign affiliates in places such as Libya. The Pentagon continues attacks against Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nAlthough Baghdadi, 48, a native of the Iraqi city of Samarra, was not the first leader of the evolving militant organization that eventually became the Islamic State, he oversaw its rise to global prominence in 2014 as it took advantage of instability and weak governance to roll across Iraq and Syria.\n\nDespite publicly declaring an ambitious extremist vision that same year, Baghdadi remained a distant, reclusive figure even to his supporters. In recent years, he has attempted to usher the organization into a renewed underground phase, urging followers in an audio message last month to attempt to break imprisoned brethren out of jail.\n\n\u00a9 Omar Haj Kadour/Afp Via Getty Images A Syrian man inspects the site of helicopter gunfire which reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in the Idlib province along the border with Turkey on October 27, 2019, where \u201cgroups linked to the Islamic State group\u201d were present.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters Tv/Reuters Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appearing at a mosque in Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014.\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking minority-party member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among the Democrats who paired accolades for a successful operation with a warning about the potential impact of Trump\u2019s larger Syria policy.\n\n\u201cThe concern of this hasty withdrawal is that we\u2019re going to lose that connectivity with the Kurds in terms of intelligence gathering,\u201d Reed said in an interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very significant loss going forward.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who spoke to reporters at the White House, voiced support for Trump\u2019s decision to back away from a full withdrawal from Syria and said the president had told him of his desire to get Baghdadi.\n\nHis death \u201cis a game changer in the war on terror,\u201d Graham said.\n\nFaysal Itani, a scholar at the Atlantic Council, said the Islamic State\u2019s militant activities had not been enabled by any special powers of Baghdadi but by conditions that remain unchanged in Iraq and Syria, suggesting its potential to rise once more.\n\n\u201cISIS\u2019s success is rooted in state failures, sectarian divides, military and intelligence experience drawn from the Baathist security state it emerged from, and an ideology that is coherent and, for some, compelling,\u201d Itani said, referring to the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq.\n\nmissy.ryan@washpost.com\n\ndan.lamothe@washpost.com\n\nLiz Sly in Los Angeles, Souad Mekhennet in Germany, Sarah Dadouch in Beirut, Kareem Fahim in Istanbul, Mustafa Salim in Baghdad and Shane Harris, Joby Warrick and Ellen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "A critical piece of information on Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts came from a disaffected Islamic State militant who became an informant for the Kurds working with the Americans, according to a U.S. official.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJpZvH.img?h=171&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1751&y=351", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
