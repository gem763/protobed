He is somebody who can make a dent in any defence and is a reassuring physical presence when you are going up against the big boys.\n\nBilly specialises in the hard yards and absorbing big hits. He also really pushes his weight at scrums and has good handling skills. Psychologically it is a boost for England to have Billy on board, his team-mates respect his talent and he lifts them.\n\nBut can England perform at the highest level without him? Absolutely. There is no need to panic, this is just routine stuff you have to deal with in any tournament.\n\nBilly Vunipola and England are waiting for the results of the scan on his injured ankle\n\nPlayers get injured, you react, tweak your plans and go again \u2014 and you never start a big match with a player who isn\u2019t 100 per cent.\n\nIn 2017 I remember the general dismay when Billy got injured before the Lions tour. \u2018Irreplaceable\u2019 was the consensus and yet it went pretty well for the Lions. England have been rock solid so far at this World Cup and installed themselves as second favourites behind New Zealand, despite Billy not being at his very best.\n\nAs his availability has become an issue, I checked the stats for his three World Cup games.\n\nTo my eyes his best performance was against Tonga, and the stats support my view with 35 metres carried and eight tackles.\n\nAgainst the USA, Billy carried for 17m and, remarkably, didn\u2019t complete a single tackle, mainly because England didn\u2019t actually have much tackling to do. Before he went off against Argentina it was 26m of carrying and two tackles.\n\nMark Wilson is the man set to come into the side at No 8 and offers something different\n\nThese statistics suggest that Billy has been ticking over so far, hopefully with a really big game just around the corner.\n\nIf he is not available on Saturday England will lose nothing in the lineout and nothing in the tackle, as Mark Wilson will be busier in that department.\n\nWilson at No 8 will have more opportunity to show his carrying abilities than usual and he is quicker than Billy off the base of the scrum.\n\nWhere Billy will be missed is in the close-quarter exchanges, those moments when you need his strength to gain that foot or two to get the pack on the front foot, or holding up a player to force a maul and turnover. The only like-for-like replacement in English rugby is Nathan Hughes, who can be a very strong ball-carrying presence but has been hit and miss for England so far.\n\nLooking at the World Cup squad it seems clear that Hughes missed out because of Eddie\u2019s new, total commitment to the dual openside flanker policy.\n\nVunipola gives England reliable go-forward ball and makes extra yards in tight spaces\n\nEddie Jones's side need to show they can adapt as injuries are part of any World Cup\n\nIf either Sam Underhill or Tom Curry gets injured he identified Lewis Ludlam \u2014 something of a bolter but a great selection \u2014 as the nearest replacement.\n\nWilson can cover all three back-row options so he got the nod over Hughes, who is very much a No 8 specialist.\n\nEngland with Wilson at No 8 will operate differently but that\u2019s what good teams do \u2014 they adapt. England won\u2019t go looking for so much contact around the fringes if Billy is absent but don\u2019t underestimate Wilson. He was arguably England\u2019s best forward in the November internationals and has always looked the part at Test level.\n\nHe will do a slightly different job but he will do it well.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Billy Vunipola is a player you'd always want in your team if fully fit.
