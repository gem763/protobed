Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was pressed by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday over what the company knew about its MCAS stall-prevention system linked to two deadly crashes, and about delays in turning over internal 2016 messages that described erratic behaviour of the software in a simulator.\n\nMuilenburg acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on MCAS before the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, as well as for failing to tell the Federal Aviation Administration for months that it made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 Max.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We\u2019re improving and we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, adds pressure on a newly rejigged Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 Max following the crashes.\n\nMuilenburg\u2019s appearance marks the first time Boeing has appeared at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first fatal crash, as the company had previously resisted earlier requests to testify.\n\nAsked ahead of the hearing if he would resign, Muilenburg said that was \u201cnot where my focus is.\u201d He also declined to say if he or the board were considering his resignation after the plane returns to service.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hearing represents Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes.\n\nU.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned Muilenburg over the company\u2019s delay in releasing internal messages. In those messages, a former test pilot described erratic behaviour of a simulator version of the same software now linked to the deadly crashes, and also mentioned \u201cJedi-mind tricking\u201d regulators over training requirements.\n\nWicker said those messages revealed a \u201cdisturbing level of casualness and flippancy.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg said he apologized to the FAA administrator for the delay in turning over the messages, and said additional documents would likely be provided over time.\n\n\u201cWe will cooperate fully,\u201d Muilenburg added.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Muilenburg walked the committee through software upgrades to limit the authority of the stall-prevention system, known as MCAS, that has been linked to both crashes, as well as changes to improve safety oversight and transparency inside the company.\n\nDuring one particularly tense exchange, Senator Maria Cantwell grilled Muilenburg and John Hamilton, a senior engineering executive, over the extent of testing on the MCAS system. Cantwell asked Hamilton whether it was a mistake for Boeing not to test a failure mode similar to the scenarios faced by pilots in the crashes.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, senator, yes,\u201d Hamilton said. Both he and Muilenburg, however, pointed to extensive testing by engineers and pilots during the certification process that lasted years.\n\nMuilenburg also acknowledged a \u201cmistake on that implementation\u201d for failing to tell the FAA for 13 months that it inadvertently made a so-called angle of attack disagree alert optional on the 737 Max, instead of standard as on earlier 737s. The company insisted the missing display represented no safety risk.\n\n\u201cWe got the implementation wrong,\u201d Muilenburg said, referring to the angle of attack disagree alert.\n\nHe added: \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned \u2026 is we need to provide additional information on MCAS to pilots.\u201d\n\nBoeing on Tuesday ran full-page advertisements in major newspapers expressing condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the crashes.\n\n\u201cThese two accidents occurred on my watch and I have a keen sense of responsibility,\u201d Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, told reporters.\n\nFamily members, holding photos of victims of the crash, were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony.\n\nWicker addressed the families, saying: \u201cI promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "CEO acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on MCAS before the crashes", "authors": ["David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/boeing-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
