Per her training, she stayed in the hall, pointed her Glock handgun at the \u201cassailant\u201d and ordered him to his knees. He complied and the whistle blew, ending the 30-second exercise.\n\nThe teacher later would face more challenging scenarios, with loud .38-caliber blanks firing. She would fire back blanks of her own.\n\nHer first run was met with applause from seasoned trainers from the Bay County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing experience,\u201d said the teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely learned a lot.\u201d\n\nThe original guardian program, created in March 2018 under the state\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, allowed administrators and other staff, including coaches and teachers, with military or law enforcement experience to volunteer as armed, concealed carry guardians.\n\nLegislation signed in May by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, expanded the program to include all eligible teachers.\n\nMore school districts have since lined up. The Florida Department of Education\u2019s safe schools office, which also was created under the public safety act, reported in August that 44 of the state\u2019s 67 school districts had authorized the program, a 42% increase from 31 districts in April.\n\nAcross the state, 1,062 guardians and 3,156 law enforcement officers have been assigned to 3,717 schools. Of the $67 million appropriated for the program, $15.8 million has been approved for 36 sheriff\u2019s offices, which are required to provide four weeks of training.\n\nProgram acceptance is left to each school board. Each teacher who participates receives a one-time $500 stipend.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not doing it for the money,\u201d said Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it for the fame and glory because they can\u2019t tell anyone that they\u2019re a guardian. They\u2019re doing it because their heart is in protecting kids, and that has been what\u2019s most striking to me is the type of person that\u2019s volunteering to do this. We\u2019re getting top-notch people whose motivation is to be a part of protecting their schools.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to active shooters, Bay District Schools Superintendent Bill Husfelt views the program as a necessary precaution. During a school board meeting in December 2010, an assailant was killed by an armed school district security guard moments after he began shooting at Mr. Husfelt and other school board members. No one else was injured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really likes the idea of arming teachers, but circumstances have really forced our hand,\u201d Mr. Husfelt said. \u201cIf someone tried to come onto one of our campuses to harm students or employees, I would want to know that we did every single thing we could to protect our children and staff, and so arming highly trained, thoroughly vetted employees seems like a prudent measure to employ.\u201d\n\nMaking the grade\n\nSheriff Ford wouldn\u2019t reveal how many guardians are in Bay District schools, but he said he is impressed with the turnout. The school district and sheriff\u2019s office work together to decide who would make a good fit. Candidates are subjected to background checks, drug screening, law enforcement interviews and psychological evaluations.\n\nEighty of the 144 hours of guardian training focuses on firearms instruction, in which candidates must score at least 85% proficiency. Deputy recruits are required to score 80%.\n\nEach guardian is issued a subcompact Glock 43 9 mm with a 3.41-inch-long barrel, which can make hitting targets more difficult than can a typical service pistol. But hit targets they must, over and over, at the sheriff\u2019s range from 3 to 25 yards.\n\n\u201cWe have some that don\u2019t pass, which is how the system is designed,\u201d Sheriff Ford said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t meet that standard, then unfortunately you don\u2019t move forward.\u201d\n\nThat was the case for the teacher above in the active shooter exercise.\n\n\u201cI grew up around guns, and I actually tried out for the program last year, but I wasn\u2019t completely ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you get to the qualifications, there\u2019s timing. There\u2019s different movement that I just wasn\u2019t prepared for. So I did a lot of training on my own over the last year, knew I was ready, came out here, proved myself and passed qualifications.\u201d\n\nGuardians meet regularly with school resource officers and undergo weapons inspections. They must requalify for the program on an annual basis.\n\nAlthough the guardian program has received some criticism, it has been accepted by most.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not as much pushback as I thought,\u201d Sheriff Ford said. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed, and people understand and appreciate a person\u2019s right to carry a firearm and defend themselves. It\u2019s not been as controversial here as it\u2019s been in other areas.\u201d\n\nA male teacher participating in guardian training said parents have been supportive of the program.\n\n\u201cTo be honest and given where we\u2019re located, I think a lot of parents are in favor of it because they want their children protected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they know that a responsible adult or staff has it, it\u2019s all for the better.\u201d\n\nMr. Husfelt, the schools superintendent, said educating others about the program helps overcome reservations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of conversations with the stakeholders about this, and we continue to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there were concerns initially, but really, once people understand the level of training involved and the fact that many of our guardians are former military and law enforcement, their comfort level seems to improve.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
