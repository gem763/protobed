The others were between Kansas City and Washington on Oct. 7, 1886, and between St. Louis and Louisville on Sept. 13, 1886, STATS said.\n\nIn a match impacting primarily which team will pick first in next June\u2019s amateur draft, Detroit dropped to a big league-worst 43-103, its most losses since setting a team mark at 43-119 in 2003.\n\nBaltimore, last in the AL East at 48-99, avoided for a night ensuring its second straight 100-loss season after going 47-115 last year.\n\nBaltimore and Detroit set a record for combined losses entering an AL series at 201.\n\n\u201cNot a lot happened offensively for us,\u201d Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cWe had some chances early, but we made some mistakes and got down 4-0. Then when we cut it in half, they came right back and got two more. By that point, they were bringing some really good arms out of the pen.\u201dAaron Brooks (5-8) allowed two runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings to win for the third win time in four decisions. Shawn Armstrong, Paul Fry, Hunter Harvey and Mychal Givens combined for one-hit relief to drop the Orioles\u2019 bullpen ERA to 2.73 since Aug. 20.\n\n\u201cComing in as a starter, you want to throw early zeroes, but late zeroes are just as important, if not more important,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see them rolling, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll keep it going.\u201d\n\nJordan Zimmermann (1-11) dropped to 0-2 in seven starts since beating the Los Angeles Angels on July 29. He allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings.\n\nZimmermann\u2019s night got off to a bad start when leadoff man Jonathan Villa rolled a slow dribbler that started foul but rolled back fair and hit the bag as first baseman Jeimer Candelario waited it out.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t going my way, and I\u2019m not pitching very well,\u201d Zimmermann said. \u201cThat\u2019s a disastrous combination.\u201d\n\nMancini hit an RBI single in the first.\n\nAfter throwing out Jordy Mercer at home plate from second base to end the fourth, Stevie Wilkerson doubled leading off the fifth to end a streak of eight straight outs by Zimmermann. Stewart homered off the right-field foul pole for a 3-0 lead and, three batters later, Chance Sisco scored on Mason Williams\u2019 groundout.\n\nMancini hit a two-run homer in the seventh against Jos\u00e9 Cisnero.\n\nMercer and Willi Castro had RBI singles in the sixth.\n\nK KINGS\n\nDetroit entered with a big league-leading 1,459 strikeouts but Brooks did not fan any of his 16 batters. Baltimore\u2019s bullpen struck out six.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot better,\u201d Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said of the bullpen. \u201cWhen we\u2019re aggressive and working ahead in the count, we do a nice job. It\u2019s when we fall behind and center-cut things in bad spots when we run into trouble.\u201d\n\nALL GOOD HERE\n\nAt the park for the annual team photo, Tigers controlling owner Christopher Ilitch said he was satisfied with the organization\u2019s progress this season.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re on the path,\u201d Ilitch said. \u201cHow much longer is it going to take? How much further do we have to progress? I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\nCOMERICA CRATERING\n\nDetroit dropped to 19-53 at Comerica Park. The Tigers are trying to avoid breaking the 1939 St. Louis Browns\u2019 record of 59 home losses and Detroit\u2019s franchise record of 58 in 2003.\n\nALMOST VICTORS\n\nThe Michigan baseball team was honored before the game and Jimmy Kerr, a 33rd round draft pick and third baseman in the Tigers farm system, threw out a wild ceremonial first pitch that nearly hit his teammates behind home plate. Michigan lost to Vanderbilt in the College World Series championship.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOrioles RHP Gabriel Ynoa (1-8, 5.79 ERA) goes into Saturday\u2019s outing 0-7 with a 6.48 ERA in 10 starts this year. Tigers LHP Daniel Norris (3-12, 4.72) has one win in his last 11 decisions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baltimore beat Detroit in the opener of the battle of the bad.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Schoch"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/orioles_tigers_baseball_14862_c0-730-1537-1626_s1770x1032.jpg?6d0bb68bb49236da9d323d5b28d4ab7ae1acbc50", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
