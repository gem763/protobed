One stratagem is as old as Rome itself, after the republic became corrupt and gave way to an empire run by one man, rather than the Senate.\n\nI\u2019m speaking of the distraction of \u201cbread and circuses,\u201d keeping the masses entertained while those in power steal more and more and secure more and more control over their subjects\u2019 lives.\n\nIn Turkey, the seat of the old Ottoman Empire, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is doing just that, bribing the masses with grandiose infrastructure projects and war games on the Iraqi border, in a blatant attempt to retain the power he has amassed over the last decade by undermining the political opposition and defusing the threat from senior military officers.\n\nMy sense after a 10-day stay here is that Mr. Erdogan was able to appease the average Turk for a while by saying, \u201cSee \u2014 you have this new bridge and this new highway. What else could you want?\u201d But with the economy weakening and the currency losing value, this new wannabe sultan may not be able to fall back on his economic accomplishments for long.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? Why, nuclear weapons, of course!\n\n\u201cSome countries have missiles with nuclear warheads, not one or two. But [they tell us] we can\u2019t have them. This, I cannot accept,\u201d the president told members of his ruling party, the AKP, in the eastern city of Sivas. \u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nNo matter that Turkey signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1980, and has also signed the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThe gambit is nothing more than a bit of bait-and-switch, an attempt to take the voter\u2019s eye off his worsening economic problems while giving him a reason to beat his chest. Meanwhile, Mr. Erdogan will continue the same failed fiscal and political policies which have brought Turkey to its present straits.\n\nThere also seems to be a bit of jealousy involved regarding a certain rival to the south.\n\n\u201cWe have Israel nearby, as almost neighbors. They scare [other nations] by possessing these [weapons]. No one can touch them,\u201d Mr. Erdogan was also quoted as saying.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Turkey lacks the financial resources and technical expertise for such an expensive and high-tech project.\n\n\u201cThe government-friendly media often exaggerates the strength of the military to increase morale in Turkey,\u201d said Turkish expert Aykan Erdemir of the Washington-based think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, in 2017.\n\nThat may be changing.\n\nThe Islamist president has also signaled many times his desire to move Turkey away from the NATO alliance and toward Russia, and even Japan. The purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system in defiance of the Trump administration and the continuing bar to membership in the European Union are further signs of a split between Turkey and its Western allies that could have dramatic security ramifications for both Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s response to all of this seems to be a charm operation to build up Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ego and hope for his eventual replacement, who could be more receptive to Western security interests.\n\nAfter my time here, it seems the average Turk on the street believes Mr. Erdogan\u2019s time is limited. The only question is how long he can cling to power and how much damage he can do before he goes.\n\n\u2022 L.
