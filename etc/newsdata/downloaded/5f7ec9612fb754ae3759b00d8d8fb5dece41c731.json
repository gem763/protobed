However, she claims producers Jeremy Bolt and Paul Anderson asked her at the last minute to perform a \u201cdangerous and technically complex motorcycle scene in adverse weather.\"\n\nAccording to Jackson, the scene required her to speed toward a camera affixed to a crane. An operator was supposed to raise the crane before Jackson hit the camera.\n\n\u201cThe sequence was planned so that the camera would start filming from a position close to the road surface and then would be lifted up through manipulating the Freedom Arm to pass over her head at close quarters,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nInstead, Jackson says she was riding the motorcycle at 40 mph when she plowed head-first into the camera crane, causing it to \u201cslice through her forearm and tearing the flesh off her cheek, leaving her teeth exposed.\u201d\n\n'MACGYVER' STUNT COORDINATOR OUT OF COMA, NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET': REPORT\n\nThe stunt performer suffered other serious injuries and had to have her left arm amputated. She was also placed into an induced coma, according to the complaint.\n\nJackson also alleges the producers led her to believe their insurance would cover any injuries suffered during taping and resulting losses \u2013 but that never happened. Jackson claims filmmakers took out \"woefully\" inadequate insurance which paid out only $33,000. She further claims she later learned there was no liability coverage for her filed claim.\n\n\u201cThe $33,000 that was made available does not cover the cost of even one of the many major surgeries that Ms. Jackson needs,\u201d Jackson\u2019s attorney Julian Chamberlayne, told the Daily Mail. \u201cShe could need 10 or more surgical procedures. This does not take into account any of the prosthetics, aids or therapies that Ms. Jackson requires, which could each cost tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d\n\n\"Had such facts been known to Plaintiff, she never would have agreed to perform \u2018The Final Chapter,\u2019 or alternatively, would have secured additional insurance on her own,\" the complaint states, adding that Jackson \"had already secured the role of stunt double for a leading cast member in \u2018Wonder Woman,\u2019 and didn't need the work.\"\n\nEVANGELINE LILLY: 'LOST' STUNT COORDINATOR INTENTIONALLY INJURED HER\n\nJackson documented her recovery on her Instagram account and even bid farewell to her \u201cwithered\u201d arm ahead of her amputation.\n\n\u201cGoodbye to my withered arm, hello to my stump. Not how I planned my life to go \ud83d\ude24 \ud83d\ude16 ...but just got to embrace what I have & move onwards & upwards \u261d\ud83d\ude0a,\u201d Jackson captioned the photo of herself smiling after her procedure. \u201cLuckily I have an awesome supportive team behind me \u2764\ufe0f @davegstunts #united49.\u201d\n\nThe stuntwoman, known as Olivia the Bandit on Instagram, thanked her husband and fellow stunt performer, Dave Grant, for his unwavering support.\n\nJackson pleads in the complaint that while she was in the induced coma, the producers reassured Grant that they would pay for his wife's mounting medical care and rehabilitation costs \u201call the way through,\u201d but they later reneged on the promise.\n\nDAREDEVIL MOTORCYCLIST PERFORMS 'SUPERMAN' STUNT ON BUSY TEXAS HIGHWAY, VIDEO SHOWS\n\nJackson originally filed the lawsuit in South Africa, however, Bolt and Anderson\u2019s attorneys were able to have it dismissed there, per the Daily Mail.\n\nIn a statement to the outlet this week, Jackson lamented her current condition.\n\n\u201cI miss my old face. I miss my old body. I miss my old life. It really hurts that I have to live with the aftermath of other people\u2019s mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I had realized that there would be wholly inadequate protection for me before I ever took the role.\u201d\n\nShe further claimed in the suit that \u201cThe Final Chapter\u201d has grossed more than $300 million worldwide and that the \"Resident Evil\" franchise as a whole has exceeded $1.2 billion. She states that a crew member, Ricardo Cornelius, was killed during the filming of the movie and alleges a total of 16 background actors were also injured in a previous iteration of the series.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJackson also names Bolt Pictures and Tannhauser Gate as defendants in the lawsuit for breach of contract and misrepresentation.
