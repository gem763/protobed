It\u2019s not one of those Breitbart online polls, is it?\n\nDid he poll \u2026 his own staff?\n\nBecause a mere 25 percent in favor of impeachment among that group would be pretty good for him at this point.\n\nOnly 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nImpeachment polling is tricky because three distinct questions tend to get conflated with each other. One: Should Democrats begin an impeachment inquiry? Two: Should they actually impeach Trump? Three: Should he be removed from office? Further complicating matters is the fact that the average American may not understand those distinctions and think that \u201cimpeachment\u201d means, quite simply, ending Trump\u2019s presidency immediately. And on top of all that, the phrasing of the question by the pollster may dramatically affect the result. For instance, ask someone if Trump should be impeached \u2014 period, without elaborating \u2014 and you may be more likely to get a \u201cyes\u201d in reply since that person can cite any ol\u2019 grievance he has with Trump to justify it. Ask the same person if Trump should be impeached over the Ukraine matter and, well, who knows? You might hear, \u201cWhat Ukraine matter?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Quinnipiac got when it tackled this subject this week. They asked the most draconian form of the question \u2014 not an impeachment inquiry, not mere impeachment, but impeachment and removal. The number was higher than 25 percent. By a lot.\n\nQuinnipiac also asked about an impeachment inquiry and found 53/43 in favor or that, in keeping with various other polls showing at least plurality support for House Democrats to pursue this. On the more basic question of whether Trump \u201cabuses the power of his office\u201d or not, the split went 55/41. Among independents it was 59/35.\n\nIs Quinnipiac an outlier, maybe? No, says FiveThirtyEight, which is tracking the polling. It\u2019s way early in the process but so far impeachment is becoming more popular:\n\nAccording to our average, 48.8 percent of people support impeachment, while only 43.6 percent don\u2019t support it.1 That\u2019s an increase even from last week, when the share of people who supported and opposed impeachment were roughly the same. What\u2019s changed? Early this week, we got a couple new, high-quality polls that showed a majority of Americans in favor of an impeachment inquiry. Most notably, a Washington Post-Schar School poll found that 58 percent of Americans agreed with the House\u2019s decision to start an impeachment inquiry, and only 38 percent disagreed with it. And an Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP poll found that 55 percent approved of the House\u2019s decision and 44 percent disapproved\u2026 From Sept. 19 to Oct. 9, backing for impeachment among Democrats has increased by 11.2 points (from 71.6 percent support to 82.8 percent support). But backing has also increased among independents by 9.6 points (from 33.9 percent to 43.5 percent). Even some Republicans have had a change of heart: Their support for impeachment has increased by 4.1 points, from 9.7 percent to 13.8 percent.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to pore through a bunch of statistics to understand why Trump\u2019s claim of 25 percent in favor of impeachment is preposterous. Democrats despise him and their leaders in Congress are all-in on impeaching him over Ukraine; the party is destined to be nearly unanimously in favor of the move. That being so, since Democrats comprise half the voting public, we\u2019re destined to see support for impeachment no lower than the mid-40s and potentially higher if independents turn on Trump.\n\nAnd maybe they will. A new poll today from Morning Consult finds 50 percent of the electorate now in favor of impeachment and removal.\n\nThe poll, conducted Monday and Tuesday, shows that 50 percent of registered voters surveyed would support the Senate\u2019s removing Trump from office, while 43 percent oppose the president\u2019s removal. Seven percent of voters were undecided. The 50 percent who support Trump\u2019s removal is identical to the percentage who approve of the intensifying impeachment inquiry into the president, and who would support the House\u2019s voting to impeach Trump. Similarly, 44 percent of voters oppose the inquiry, and 43 percent would oppose the House\u2019s impeaching the president\u2026 Democrats would support the Senate\u2019s voting to remove Trump from office, 88 percent to 7 percent. Among Republicans, only 12 percent would support Trump\u2019s removal, and 83 percent would oppose it. Roughly as many independents would support the Senate\u2019s ousting Trump (44 percent) as would oppose it (43 percent).\n\nSo Morning Consult has Americans slightly in favor of removal and Quinnipiac has them slightly opposed to it. \u201cEvenly divided\u201d is a good approximation of where we\u2019re at. The good news for Trump is that that\u2019s nowhere near enough to spook Senate Republicans into removing him. In fact, at 43.6 percent, his average job approval today is a shade higher than it was two months ago before the Ukraine fiasco began. My suspicion that the entire impeachment brouhaha will have relatively little effect on people\u2019s views of him is bearing out so far.\n\nBut let\u2019s say I\u2019m wrong. Would Democrats still be willing to impeach Trump if they had reason to believe it would hurt them at the polls next fall? Reuters asked that question in a new poll of its own. Result:\n\nThe poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, found that 55% of Democrats said that their party leaders should press ahead with impeachment even \u201cif it means a lengthy and expensive process that could weaken their chances of winning the presidency in 2020.\u201d And even a higher number \u2013 66% of Democrats \u2013 agreed that Congress should pursue impeachment, \u201ceven if that means they will need to postpone efforts to pass laws that could benefit me.\u201d\n\nThe same poll found 59 percent in favor of Democrats investigating the Ukraine matter and plurality support for impeachment, 45/39. Maybe the next round of surveys will be better, though: Now that the White House is going all out to argue that the impeachment inquiry is unfair, replete with a conservative-media-friendly ranty letter from the White House counsel about its procedural defects, some of the Republicans in these polls who have supported the inquiry thus far might find themselves drifting back into Trump\u2019s corner. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see his numbers on impeachment better next week. Although nowhere near as little as 25 percent in favor.\n\nUpdate: Well then.\n\nYou-know-who\u2019s going to have a conniption when he sees that his favorite network dropped a number like that on him.", "description": "Perspective.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
