As the incoming editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon, she\u2019s the first woman to oversee a prominent conservative news outlet. She\u2019s a seasoned reporter after stints at National Review and Politico too, with plenty of sources by dint of her time on the White House beat. And she\u2019s just 35. She\u2019s going places.\n\nRespected journalist + young female success story + ideological diversity for a network often slammed as too liberal = easy decision to keep her on as a contributor after she takes over at the Beacon, one would think.\n\nUnless the \u201cideological diversity\u201d part is a problem?\n\nEliana Johnson, a leading White House reporter for Politico, will not have her contract renewed for her CNN political analyst role after she accepted a new job running the neoconservative Washington Free Beacon. CNN confirmed her existing contract is due to expire in November and that the network does not plan to renew it, saying the decision is being made because she will no longer be a White House reporter specifically\u2026 Other high-profile reporters have maintained contracts at the network as they\u2019ve changed beats or news outlets \u2014 Ryan Lizza, a CNN political analyst, has been at the network since he was a Washington correspondent at the New Yorker, and then as he moved from being chief political correspondent at Esquire to chief Washington correspondent at Politico.\n\nShe won\u2019t be reporting directly on the White House herself \u2014 but she\u2019ll be overseeing people who do. Doubtless she\u2019ll also leverage her own sources as necessary to supplement the Beacon\u2019s reporting. That is, there\u2019s no reason to think Johnson\u2019s awareness of what\u2019s going on in the administration will diminish in her new role. If anything, it might improve. And although the Beacon might not be as prestigious in Washington as Politico is, the role of editor carries a bit more prestige than the role of reporter does.\n\nSo it\u2019s strange that CNN would pull the plug on Johnson at a moment when she\u2019s grown in stature. And particularly strange given that her influence at the Beacon is likely to mean more hard-news reporting there, something that\u2019s lacking in much of conservative media. It may well be that she\u2019ll succeed in turning the Beacon\u2019s White House beat into a must-read for the political class. If you\u2019re CNN management, why wouldn\u2019t you extend her now and see how she does, just in case she becomes a Washington player?\n\nI was prepared to ignore this story in the belief that there are all sorts of obscure reasons that media companies don\u2019t renew people\u2019s contracts, but then I saw this tweet from Johnson herself last night. Clearly she also thinks CNN\u2019s not telling the truth about why it\u2019s cutting her loose:\n\nI didn\u2019t realize becoming the first female editor-in-chief of a conservative news site was \u201cpursing a different career path.\u201d I\u2019ll still be in the newsbreaking business. And perhaps even covering the White House. \u2014 Eliana Johnson (@elianayjohnson) September 6, 2019\n\nMatt Dornic is CNN\u2019s spokesman. She\u2019s calling BS on their spin in full public view.\n\nIs this as simple as it looks? Johnson had made herself \u201cacceptable\u201d to the network by leaving right-wing media for Politico, and now that she\u2019s reverted to right-wingery she\u2019s damaged goods? If that\u2019s the case, we need to reckon with the fact that the network does still employ righties like Rich Lowry and Mary Katharine Ham as contributors. Maybe there\u2019s a belief within CNN that it\u2019s fine to have right-wingers on to offer opinions, but having someone on who oversees a right-wing site to deliver scoops breaks an unwritten rule that only liberals can be trusted to \u201cfairly\u201d report the news. You can rely on Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon to give you an, ahem, neutral account of the day\u2019s events, but however could we trust Johnson to do so?", "description": "\"She\u2019s now pursuing a different career path and off that beat.
