This official said that the U.S. was working to identify its own citizens in the custody of America\u2019s local Kurdish allies\u2014the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF\u2014and has repatriated four so far for trial. (One dual Saudi American citizen the U.S. had suspected of joining ISIS, but never brought to trial, was freed in Bahrain last year; in another case, the State Department controversially argued that an accused ISIS propagandist, Hoda Muthana, was not actually a citizen despite being born in Alabama.) But thousands of other foreign fighters\u2014not even counting Iraqis and Syrians\u2014are in makeshift prisons northeastern Syria.\n\nAmong democratic countries, which arguably have the best means to bring them to justice and hold them securely, there is very little interest in bringing them home to face prosecution\u2014or even in bringing home the wives and children of ISIS fighters, who are being held separately in squalid detention centers.\n\nA further irony is that authoritarian Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan, have been leading the way on repatriating their citizens from Iraq and Syria\u2014especially women and children\u2014and casting their efforts in humanitarian terms, Letta Tayler, a senior researcher in terrorism and counterterrorism at Human Rights Watch, told me. \u201cWestern Europe is hiding its head in the sand when it should be taking care of its citizens,\u201d said Tayler, who recently visited separate camps in northeastern Syria, where the families of suspected ISIS members are being held in conditions she described as squalid and horrifying. \u201cIf Kazakhstan can repatriate by the hundreds, surely western Europe, with far greater resources and far fewer suspects and family members \u2026 can do the same.\u201d (Tayler has written that France, for example, has brought back 17 children\u2014but has left at least 400 people, including children, behind.)\n\nRead: He was branded the \u2018American Taliban.\u2019 Now he\u2019s getting out of jail.\n\nIn a rare moment of praise for a post-Soviet dictatorship, Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, said the country was showing \u201cmuch needed leadership on the critical global issue.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, concerns that, public messaging aside, authorities in dictatorships like Kazakhstan may themselves abuse prisoners. N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in highlighted the country\u2019s use of domestic-counterterrorism laws against religious minorities and political dissenters. Tayler says Human Rights Watch has been pushing for transparency about what happens to prisoners in custody. But the broader significance of policies like Kazakhstan\u2019s, she says, is that they expose the weakness of the western European argument that it\u2019s too difficult or dangerous to take such suspects back.", "description": "Italy just took back an alleged fighter to face trial.
