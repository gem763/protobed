That\u2019s not true. The Democratic-controlled House in February approved legislation, which has since stalled because the Senate hasn\u2019t acted. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he won\u2019t move on it or any gun legislation until Trump says what he wants.\n\nAnd on the environment, Trump and his team are dismissing the reality of stalled U.S. progress in air quality. In revoking California\u2019s authority to set stricter fuel economy standards on cars than Washington, they claimed that more lenient rules would be \u201cgood\u201d for the environment. His administration\u2019s data show otherwise.\n\nThe claims helped mark a week of familiar exaggerations, misstatements and fabrications by Trump, on topics from drug prices and the news media to trade.\n\nA recap:\n\nGUN CONTROL\n\nTRUMP, on gun legislation: \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that, frankly, Congress is wasting all their time on nonsense. \u2026The Democrats in Congress are doing nothing.\u201d - remarks to reporters Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Trump is the holdup on gun control legislation.\n\nThe House passed its bill in February that would require background checks on all gun sales, including those between strangers who meet online or at gun shows. But McConnell, R-Ky., said it\u2019s not clear the Senate would be able to pass the legislation or that Trump would sign it into law. Last week, McConnell stressed that Congress would remain \u201cin a holding pattern\u201d on gun control as lawmakers await proposals from the White House.\n\nTrump had previously pledged to veto the House-passed bill, but has since offered contradictory messages in reacting to recent mass shootings. Days after the El Paso shooting last month, he said he was eager to implement \u201cvery meaningful background checks\u201d on guns and told reporters there was \u201ctremendous support\u201d for action. He later backed away, saying the current system of background checks was \u201cvery, very strong.\u201d\n\nA proposal being floated last week by Attorney General William Barr on Capitol Hill would require background checks on all commercial gun sales, including at gun shows. Trump told reporters the plan was one of many ideas under consideration and he would go \u201cvery slowly.\u201d\n\nHe and White House aides have discussed a number of gun control measures with lawmakers, including steps to go after fraudulent buyers, notify state and local law enforcement when a potential buyer fails a background check, issue state-level emergency risk protection orders, boost mental health assistance and speed up executions for those convicted of mass shootings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have told Trump that gun-control legislation must include the House-passed bill to expand background checks, saying that any other proposal could leave open dangerous loopholes.\n\n___\n\nCLIMATE\n\nSTEVEN MNUCHIN, secretary of the Treasury: \u201cWe are very focused on clean air, clean water \u2026The U.S. technology has made major progress in these areas.\u201d - interview Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cYou know right now we have the cleanest air that we have ever had in this country?\u201d - New Mexico rally on Sept. 16.\n\nTHE FACTS: They\u2019re incorrect. Air quality hasn\u2019t improved under the Trump administration and dozens of nations have less smoggy air than the U.S.\n\nAs to water quality, one measure, Yale University\u2019s global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water.\n\nBut after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled . Over the last two years the U.S. had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, federal data show.\n\nThere were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when the U.S had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980.\n\nThe Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days.\n\nThe nonprofit Health Effects Institute\u2019s State of Global Air 2019 report ranked the United States 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone, also known as smog, worse than the global average for population-weighted pollution. Countries such as Britain, Japan, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Albania, Cuba, Russia, Vietnam, New Zealand and Canada have less smoggy air.\n\nThe U.S. ranks eighth cleanest on the more deadly category of fine particles in the air.\n\nOn environmental quality overall, the Yale index put the U.S. 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.\n\n___\n\nMNUCHIN: \u201cThe reason why the president got out of the Paris deal, because it was an unfair deal for the U.S., relative to the rest of the world.\u201d - CNN on Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not true. While the Trump administration is entitled to its opinion that the landmark 2015 Paris agreement deal hurts American workers, the pact did not put the U.S. in a more unfavorable position relative to the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the agreement, every country created and chose its own goals to reduce carbon pollution. The U.S. goal , set at the time by the Obama administration, was to, by 2025, reduce emissions by 28% compared with 2005, which translates to 14% compared with 1990 levels. That goal was less stringent than Britain, which already reduced its level by 45% compared with 1990 levels, and countries in the European Union, whose goal was to achieve reductions of 40% below the 1990 level by 2030, according to Stanford University professor Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project of scientists who track worldwide carbon emissions.\n\nThe U.S. commitment was \u201cfrankly, not particularly too ambitious,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThere were some countries that set lower goals than the U.S., such as Russia. But Trump could have relaxed the U.S. goal if he considered it too burdensome rather than withdraw from the deal altogether.\n\n\u201cTrump rejected the Paris agreement because he\u2019s not committed to climate action, not because the U.S. target was too stringent or unfair,\u201d said Nigel Purvis, CEO of the consultancy group Climate Advisers, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\n\n___\n\nFUEL ECONOMY RULES\n\nTRUMP, on revoking California\u2019s authority to set stricter vehicle fuel-economy standards than Washington imposes: This \u201cwill also be extremely good to the environment.\u201d - remarks to reporters Wednesday.\n\nWHEELER: \u201cThis is \u2026 good for the environment.\u201d - remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That assertion is not supported by the Trump administration\u2019s own data, which estimates that U.S. fuel consumption would increase by 500,000 barrels per day, up 2% to 3% , with the loss of California\u2019s authority to set higher standards. That means more pollution. Environmental groups predict higher fuel consumption than that.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on revoking California\u2019s authority: \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to produce an automobile for substantially less money which is substantially safer.\u201d - remarks to reporters Wednesday.\n\nELAINE CHAO, secretary of transportation: \u201cThose rules were making cars more expensive and impeding safety because consumers were being priced out of newer, safer vehicles.\u201d - remarks Thursday.\n\nWHITE HOUSE: \u201cThe Trump administration is taking action to make America\u2019s highways safer and our cars more affordable.\u201d - news release Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump and his officials are inflating the projected savings to consumers under his plan to relax fuel-efficiency rules and may be exaggerating the safety benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet what the Trump administration will propose as its final fuel-efficiency rules, but in the past it has favored freezing Obama-era mileage standards at 2021 levels. His own administration contends that freezing the fuel economy standards will reduce the average sticker price of new vehicles by about $2,700 by 2025. But that number is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the estimates from the Obama administration.\n\nThey are also ignoring money that consumers would save at the gas pump under the Obama-era standards if cars get better mileage. A study released Aug. 7 by Consumer Reports found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels. The administration\u2019s proposed freeze would hold the average fuel economy for the new-vehicle fleet at 29.1 mpg in real-world driving, while the Obama-era standards would raise it to 37.5 mpg by 2026, according to Consumer Reports.\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion that cars would be substantially safer also is in dispute. His administration argues that lower-cost vehicles would allow more people to buy new ones that are safer, cutting roadway deaths by 12,700 lives through the 2029 model year.\n\nBut The Associated Press reported last year that internal EPA emails show senior career officials privately questioned the administration\u2019s calculations, saying the proposed freeze would actually modestly increase highway fatalities, by about 17 deaths annually. Consumer Reports adds that any safety impact from changes in gas mileage standards would be small and won\u2019t vary much from zero.\n\n___\n\nELECTRIC CARS\n\nANDREW WHEELER, administrator of the EPA, criticizing electric cars: It\u2019s \u201ca product \u2026 which most families cannot approach.\u201d - remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: While electric cars are currently out of reach for most people, that is changing. Automakers are rolling out multiple new models, and as sales grow and battery costs fall, prices are expected to drop. Range is growing to where many electric cars will be able to travel over 300 miles on a single charge. The McKinsey management consulting firm predicts that battery and other EV-specific costs will fall to about the same as gasoline engines in three to five years. Fully electric vehicles currently make up about 1.5% of U.S. new vehicle sales, and LMC Automotive forecasts EV sales will eventually hit 50% of the market by 2049.\n\n___\n\nDRUG PRICES\n\nTRUMP: \u201cBecause of my Administration, drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years.\u201d - tweet Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s exaggerating his influence on drug prices.\n\nMost of his administration\u2019s \u201cambitious campaign\u201d to reduce drug prices has yet to be completed. Major regulations are in the works and legislation has yet to be passed by Congress. A rule requiring drugmakers to disclose prices in TV ads has been blocked for now by the courts.\n\nIt\u2019s true that harsh criticism of the industry - from Trump and lawmakers of both parties in Congress - may be having some effect.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the past eight months, which is highly unusual. That index includes lower-cost generic drugs, which account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. Prices for generics have been declining under pressure from big drug distributors.\n\nBut for brand-name drugs, a recent analysis by The Associated Press shows that on average prices are still going up, but at a slower pace. The cost of brand-name drugs is what\u2019s most concerning to consumers, with insured patients facing steep copays for some medications.\n\nThe AP analysis found that in the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand-name medicines by a median, or midpoint, of 5%.\n\nThat does reflect a slowing in price increases. They were going up 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years. But it\u2019s not a decrease in actual prices. There were 37 price increases for every decrease in the first seven months of 2019. Pricing data for the AP analysis came from the health information firm Elsevier.\n\n___\n\nNEWS MEDIA\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe New York Times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history. Not only is it losing a lot of money, but it is a journalistic disaster.\u201d - tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Although entitled to his opinion about the quality of journalism, he is wrong to say The New York Times is losing money. It\u2019s making money.\n\nThe newspaper last month said overall net income rose 6.7% to $25.2 million.\n\nEarnings adjusted for one-time items came to 17 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations of 15 cents, according to FactSet. Revenue rose 5.2% to $436.3 million.\n\nThe stock has increased more than 30% since the beginning of the year.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).\u201d - tweet on Sept. 15.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s ignoring his own words and those of his aides.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the White House the week before that Trump made clear he would meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without setting any conditions first. Often, top-level diplomacy between adversaries only proceeds after both sides agree to take a few steps to ease tensions.\n\nAnd when asked by NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in June whether he\u2019d set any conditions for meeting Iranian leadership, Trump replied: \u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned. No preconditions.\u201d\n\nA year earlier, Trump told reporters that it would be good for both countries if the leaders talked: \u201cNo preconditions. If they wanna meet, I\u2019ll meet.\u201d\n\nAfter his tweet, Trump explained that sanctions won\u2019t be taken off Iran as a requirement for talks, and that\u2019s what he meant when he declared \u201cno preconditions.\u201d But the absence of preconditions cuts both ways. It also means, for example, that Iran\u2019s behavior - with its nuclear program or with hostile actions against other states in the region - do not need to be checked for Trump and Iran\u2019s leadership to come to the table.\n\n___\n\nFAMILIAR REFRAINS\n\nTRUMP, in an assortment of statements he repeats frequently: \u201cFor the vets we got Choice, we got Choice for the vets.\u201d \u201dChina\u2019s not doing too well, must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years.\u201d \u201dSo now we are taking and billions and billions of dollars from China when in the past we never got 10 cents, we never got money, we never got anything.\u201d - New Mexico rally on Sept 16.\n\nTHE FACTS: None of this is true.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the law offering health-care choice for veterans; Trump expanded it. China\u2019s economy was not worse a half century ago than it is now. The U.S. has long collected tariffs, including on goods from China, and they are being paid primarily by U.S. importers and often by American consumers.\n\n___\n\nBorenstein reported from New York.
