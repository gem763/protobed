It is similarly as if, having found their feet in international football, they began to run and just kept going.\n\nThe Nations League was just the right setting that allowed them to get a sense of themselves against teams of supposedly similar ability, and then saw them pick up more and more momentum to get bigger and better results.\n\nAn initial 0-0 against Azerbaijan - after nine consecutive competitive defeats in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers - became two-goal wins over the Faroe Islands and Malta, which became five-goal wins, which became encouraging draws against Bulgaria and Montenegro and finally crucial victories over such sides\u2026 until now, their biggest fixture to date.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got that passion of a relatively newly formed nation, which reminds me a little bit of when Croatia came through,\u201d Southgate said on Saturday. \u201cI think they will come full of belief. Their record is outstanding at the moment. They\u2019ll be full of confidence. It\u2019s a really good test for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what England have missed so far in this group, that has just seen them cruise through in second gear.\n\nThere\u2019s none of that for Kosovo. Every game is such an event.\n\nAnother large part of that is because their specific situation has allowed them to avoid the factors that have led to such drastic drop-offs and declines for countries like Bulgaria and Czech Republic.\n\nDue to the history of the country and the circumstances that surrounded their gradual breakaway from Serbia, around 80% of the players are from migrant backgrounds that saw them develop in the wealthiest western European countries.\n\nThat can be seen in the level of their clubs, which is much higher than Bulgaria\u2019s.\n\nKosovo have captain Samir Ujkani at Torino, Amir Rrahmani at Verona, Florent Hadergjonaj at Huddersfield Town, Bersant Selina at Swansea City, Valon Berisha at Lazio, Atdhe Nuhiu at Sheffield Wednesday and - among the most dangerous - Fenerbahce striker Vedat Muriqi.\n\nThis can mostly be seen, however, in their football.\n\nKosovo just have a good European team of the level you\u2019d usually expect Bulgaria and Czech Republic.\n\nThis is why they\u2019ve beaten them.\n\nThis is why they represent such a danger for England, even with Milot Rashica and Arber Zeneli - two hugely exciting wide players at Werder Bremen and Reims, respectively - injured.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re missing two super wingers, but they still have depth,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cTactically, they\u2019re very good.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re genuinely a level beyond anything England have faced so far, which will itself come as a surprise to anyone who just looked at the group and saw the old names.\n\nThese are a new name, reaching new levels.\n\nIt is thereby not quite the match for experimentation for Southgate.\n\nIt is a game where he needs his players to be exact, or they may get caught out.", "description": "It is something Gareth Southgate is all too aware of, but may catch a lot of people out.
