When people are angry, bad things happen; when spirits are uplifted, well, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd can get the Statue of Liberty to move around and help them defeat Vigo the Carpathian.\n\nThe point is, three decades after the film\u2019s release, social media is sort of like the slime in Ghostbusters 2. For the most part, the energy that gets dumped into it is negative as is the ensuing reaction, but sometimes, rarely, there are good bits. On a daily basis, you can count on Shea Serrano and his FOH (Fuck Outta Here) Army to create a couple of those positive moments and make you remember the entire world is not that GIF of the flaming dumpster fire everybody likes to post.\n\nA staff writer at The Ringer, Serrano taught science to eighth graders at a school in south Houston for nine years before he was able to leave the classroom to focus on writing full-time less than five years ago.\n\nThe author of the forthcoming book Movies (And Other Things), the 38-year-old had a Twitter account while he worked at the school but, since he was only writing as a freelancer at the time, he mostly just used it as a means to contact individuals he was interested in writing about.\n\n\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t get in contact with a rapper, if I was writing about rap, I\u2019d use it,\u201d Serrano tells InsideHook. \u201cIt was impossible to email Bun B, but you could hit him up on Twitter and he would almost always respond. I had it for stuff like that and then it just became a bigger part of my existence when I left teaching. That was when I really was like \u2018All right I guess I\u2019m going to spend more time on this thing since I\u2019m not in a classroom for eight, nine hours a day.\u2019 Once the snowball starts to pick up a little more snow as it goes down the hill, it grows faster and faster.\u201d\n\nThe cover of Serrano\u2019s \u201cMovies (And Other Things).\u201d (Twelve Books)\n\nAt the time, Serrano only had about 40,000 followers \u2014 which, to be fair, is a ton of followers \u2014 but saw that number grow exponentially after his first book, The Rap Year Book, came out in 2015 and troops began enlisting in the FOH Army in earnest.\n\nWhen the book was released, the publisher had only ordered about 15,000 copies because that was how many they were expecting to sell over the next two years or so. They were in for a surprise.\n\nBy using self-promotion on Twitter, Serrano got his followers to buy up all the copies from retailers like Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million. When one seller\u2019s supply ran out, Serrano used his Twitter account to issue marching orders as to where his loyal followers should turn next to buy the book.\n\nI\u2019m like a lazy Spider-Man \u2026 I\u2019m just going to send some tweets from my couch and then hopefully we can fund your GoFundMe page.\n\n\u201cEvery place we were going, they were selling out and somebody made a joke that we were like a shitty army, the shittiest version of an army, just going to places and causing trouble,\u201d Serrano says. \u201cThen somebody else came behind them and was like \u2018We\u2019re the FOH Army.\u2019 I think that was because somebody had made a \u2018Get the fuck out of here\u2019 joke at one point because a place said we weren\u2019t going to sell out and then we sold out. It was like \u2018Get the fuck out of here, of course we\u2019re going to sell out.'\u201d\n\nNow, two more books, hundreds of articles and untold numbers of tweets later, Serrano\u2019s Twitter army has more than 300,000 followers and he\u2019s almost guaranteed to hit the New York Times Bestseller List with anything he publishes thanks to pre-ordered copies. That sort of success in book sales is almost unheard of unless you\u2019re Dan Brown or Oprah picks you for her book club. The FOH Army has become a force in the publishing world.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a thing that I planted or even a thing that I made,\u201d he says. \u201cSomebody else came up with it. I don\u2019t even remember who it was. It was just a person on Twitter and then, once it had a name, it became a thing, Like as soon as Taco Tuesday, for example, as soon as that had a name people were like oh, \u2018We eat tacos on Tuesday.\u2019 I get it.\u201d\n\nThough Serrano does still ask his followers to buy his books, he also has used the FOH Army to do everything from raising money for hurricane relief efforts and Planned Parenthood to soliciting donations for an airport worker who drove the author around to help him find his lost car.\n\nShea Serrano, photographed in San Antonio. (Josh Huskin)\n\nSerrano calls the group\u2019s fundraising work \u201cguerrilla philanthropy\u201d and says there\u2019s actually very little organization that does into the FOH\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cI was reading a story about an LGBTQ youth center and saw they needed money. It just happened across my timeline,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the story, they were explaining the high rate of suicide attempts in that population and I was like \u2018Damn, that super fucking sucks.\u2019 Then I saw they had a nonprofit and that there was an easy way to donate money. I just started sharing that, you know, hey here\u2019s a thing, do you want to donate? We might\u2019ve sent in like $10,000 or $12,000. That\u2019s how all of this stuff works. I get sent shit all day long, every day. Sometimes a thing will stand out. If I share it, then you know, fingers crossed here we go.\u201d\n\nIt sounds sort of like a Spider-Man situation: with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good way to put it,\u201d Serrano says. \u201cI\u2019m like the worst. I\u2019m like a lazy Spider-Man. I\u2019m not going to do anything myself. I\u2019m just going to send some tweets from my couch and then hopefully we can fund your GoFundMe page. It\u2019s been really cool. I think over the past few years, we\u2019ve topped over $300,000 in straight cash donations to people or places. That\u2019s a cool reputation to have. That\u2019s more meaningful than the Bestseller List. We\u2019re talking about a real-life impact. That\u2019s a thing you experience a lot when you\u2019re teaching. You get to see this impact that you\u2019ve had on somebody else\u2019s life. It doesn\u2019t happen so much as a writer, but this allows for that to be a thing.\u201d\n\nAn illustrated page from \u201cMovies (And Other Things). (Arturo Torres)\n\nThe influence Serrano now yields has also had another real-life impact.\n\n\u201cNow I can walk into a room and they have to take me much more seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWith The Rap Year Book, I had never done a book before and I was at the mercy of the publisher. They were just giving me advice, telling me this, telling me that, then all of this stuff happened and we sold a bunch of books. People realized if I put something out, more than likely a certain amount of people are going to buy it. That\u2019s an interesting proposition for a publisher or for any place that wants to sell stuff.\u201d\n\nHowever, that increased influence has not changed the way Serrano interacts with people online.\n\n\u201cI think that the most fun part is definitely interacting with people,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the time I\u2019m on there just celebrating stuff and people show up for that. I\u2019m also very clear about any sort of beliefs I have, be it political, be it pro-choice, be it whatever or supportive of whatever communities are out there. A lot of times, the people who don\u2019t agree with that might make a little fuss for a minute and then they leave and they\u2019re gone and everybody else is like \u2018Oh cool.\u2019 You make enough noise about the stuff you like and like your friends stick around and the people who aren\u2019t your friends leave and then it feels better.\u201d\n\nSo, even though Serrano is the butt of a running joke that he\u2019s extremely muscular, 29 and 6\u20193\u2033 (none of which are true), being the general of the FOH Army ain\u2019t too shabby.\n\n\u201cWriting is fun. I enjoy it. It\u2019s a cool job to have. I like that it allows me a lifestyle I want to live,\u201d Serrano says. \u201cMost days, I\u2019m just sitting at the computer or I walk across the street to the movie theater by my office and watch whatever. This is just what I\u2019m doing for work. I really like that part of it. But more than anything, I just want to make some jokes with some people on the internet and then just make it to dinner so I can eat my food.\u201d", "description": "Serrano, the author of the forthcoming book \"Movies (And Other Things),\" explains how he became one of Twitter's most positive influencers.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-5.jpg?fit=1052%2C701", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
