The feature is being powered by Finablr subsidiary Travelex.\n\nBoth companies claimed the new feature was the first to offer foreign exchange in a native mobile wallet in the U.S. Google Pay currently lets people transfer funds within the U.S., while Apple Cash supports sending money through iMessage.\n\nMobile wallets have proven particularly popular in countries China and India, with platforms like Alipay, WeChat Pay and Paytm gaining momentum. Research has shown however that mobile payments haven't enjoyed the same penetration in the U.S.", "description": "Samsung has teamed up with financial technology firm Finablr on a money transfer service for its payments app.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106162014-1570092442909samsungpaymoneytransferimage3.jpg?v=1570092598"}
