How can we have an advantage?\u201d said Klopp. \u201cIf you ask me about December, where can we fit in an extra game? It's not possible, but we did it somehow because we have to, because we go to Qatar and play in the Fifa Club World Cup.\n\n\u201cI am completely on City's side that these games, over 46 hours, should not happen. It's like when we played Sunderland [in 2016]. It's just not okay. Three years later we are still speaking about it and nothing has changed. We still have it.\n\n\u201cThere are excuses, they [the TV companies] pay a lot of money, that is true. But we still have to work on these things.\n\n\u201cForty-eight hours between games is still pretty much unacceptable, but less than 46 hours... I really get that [City being unhappy]. I understand 100 per cent.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, has poured scorn on the suggestion his side have been given an unfair advantage over title rivals Manchester City after changes to the December fixture schedule.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "James Ducker", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212102885-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhGenw97R1w1jyzB75NVea8DJ_lgmFmRj1SE3vCGdWQs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
