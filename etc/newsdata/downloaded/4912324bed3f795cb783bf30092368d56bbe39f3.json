Prof. Cesare Galli and his team matured and fertilized eggs collected on Aug. 22 from Najin and Fatu, the last two females in the world, who live at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, with sperm previously collected from males Suni and Saut.\n\n\"We brought 10 oocytes (immature egg cells) back from Kenya, five from each female. After incubation, seven matured and were suitable for fertilization,\" Galli said.\n\nAfter 10 days of incubation, two of Fatu's eggs developed into viable embryos that were cryopreserved for future transfer, the scientists said.\n\nThe last living male northern white rhino was a 45-year-year-old named Sudan, who gained fame in 2017 with his listing as \"The Most Eligible Bachelor in the World\" on the Tinder dating app, in a fundraising effort. Sudan was euthanized after age-related complications in March 2018.\n\nDecades of poaching decimated the northern white rhino's numbers. Sudan was the last of his kind to be born in the wild, in the country he was named after.\n\nOther rhinos \u2014 the southern white rhino and the black rhino \u2014 are also prey for poachers, who kill them for their horns to supply illegal markets in parts of Asia.\n\nThe efforts to save the northern white rhino species have been led by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany; Avantea; the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic; the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya; and the Kenya Wildlife Service.", "description": "An international consortium of scientists and conservationists has announced that they succeeded in creating two embryos of the near-extinct northern white rhino, a milestone in assisted reproduction that may be a pivotal turning point in the fate of the species.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279508.1568223972!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kenya-rhino.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
