Similar to Bayern Munich.\n\n\u201cBut that season, we finished by winning the Premier League in Argentina six months later \u2013 and even reached the final of the Copa Libertadores, only losing to Sao Paulo on penalties after a replay.\n\n\u201cIn six months, we changed completely the perception. Sometimes this type of situation makes you stronger and, of course, better.\n\n\u201cThat is the most important thing. We need to be clever and learn from this type of situation.\n\n\u201cBut we will have to do it in a different way for me now. That was 27 years ago \u2013 now it is a different era, a different period of people. But of course, it was an experience.\n\n\u201cI was 19 years old then and how I perceived the situation was different to how I see it now.\n\n\u201cBut I remember Bielsa talking to us individually and talking to the collective, making changes and slowly turning around the situation.\n\n\u201cFootball changes, society chances, but the principle and psychology is still there 30 years later.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We were talking before training, during training, after training and at lunchtime, and we all feel the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so painful. You cannot be happy with that defeat.
