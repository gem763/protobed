On 29 September, about 20 men on motorcycles attacked the village of Komsilga in Bam province, killing nine people, and burning shops and two car tyres. Later the same day, seven people were killed after armed individuals attacked the village of Deneon in the same province. A third attack in Deou in Soum province saw a soldier killed during an attack on an army unit.\n\nDangerous, complex, vast: UK troops' challenges in Mali Read more\n\nThe Burkinabe army, which itself has suffered heavy losses, has been unable to stop the attacks, which were initially concentrated in the north but have since spread to other regions in the east and west.\n\nAttacks on emblems of the state, hit-and-run raids on remote villages and brutal interpretation of Islamic law have forced an estimated 300,000 people to flee their homes to the south.\n\nThe attacks have also fuelled intercommunal violence and seen about 2,000 schools closed.\n\nWest African leaders announced a $1bn plan to combat jihadist violence at a summit in Burkina Faso last month. The fight against the rising tide of jihadist violence in the region has so far been hampered by a lack of funds.\n\nThe G5 Sahel, a joint taskforce, was created in 2014 to try to tackle the problem, backed by the region\u2019s former colonial power, France. From July 2017, it pooled troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger in a bid to drive back the jihadist groups.\n\nBut a lack of finance, training and equipment limited their effectiveness and their numbers. The force currently numbers 4,000 troops although 5,000 were originally planned.\n\nBritish troops are due to join a UN peacekeeping mission in Mali next year.\n\nAccording to the US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the number of radical Islamist-linked attacks in the Sahel has doubled each year since 2016. Last year, the tally was 465 \u2013 more than one a day.", "description": "Deadly assault on gold mine follows spate of violence in region south of Sahara blamed on Islamist insurgency", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4796441cb34ae4b3ba7796481ea5a8b90d9efb63/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b0f023d90fdfcd0de056b87e76c6ecf", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
