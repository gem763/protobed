What was the condition for the aid? And you didn\u2019t mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.\u201d\n\nWallace, once again, threw Mulvaney\u2019s own remarks back in his face, playing yet another clip from the press briefing of Mulvaney claiming military aid to Ukraine was contingent upon them cooperating with the Trump administration and investigating the Democrats.\n\nThe Trump aide, however, attempted to brush off his previous remarks by saying he didn\u2019t actually use the words \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d prompting Wallace to point out that when Karl pressed him on whether or not there was a quid pro quo, Mulvaney said that \u201chappens all the time.\u201d\n\nFox News Host Ed Henry: Not \u2018Media\u2019s Fault\u2019 Mick Mulvaney Admitted Quid Pro Quo\n\nThe two would go back and forth over this issue for a few more minutes, with Wallace repeatedly cornering Mulvaney over his previous comments and the chief of staff flailing away and struggling to present even a laughable defense.\n\nAt one point, Wallace asked Mulvaney whether he had offered his resignation to Trump in the wake of the blowback and criticism he received over the press briefing. Mulvaney said the topic was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d discussed with the president, adding that he is \u201cvery happy working there.\u201d\n\nCNN, meanwhile, reported Sunday that prior to the impeachment crisis that Trump finds himself currently embroiled in, there were internal efforts to push Mulvaney out as acting chief of staff. Those efforts subsided, however, when the push for impeachment heated up in the wake of the Ukraine scandal late last month.\n\nBesides the issues surrounding the Ukraine scandal and impeachment, Wallace also grilled Mulvaney on the president\u2019s sudden reversal on next year\u2019s G7 summit, which Mulvaney announced last week would be held at Trump\u2019s personal property.\n\nAsked by Wallace why the president \u201ccaved\u201d to the bipartisan backlash, Mulvaney said Trump was \u201chonestly surprised at the level of pushback,\u201d adding that the president \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\nWallace seized on the \u201chospitality business\u201d comment and pressed Mulvaney if the president understood why it \u201clooked lousy.\u201d The acting chief of staff's retort: \u201cI think he thinks people think it looks lousy.\u201d\n\nSean Hannity Goes Off on Mick Mulvaney: \u2018I Just Think He\u2019s Dumb\u2019\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
