Saputo guaranteed Koroit would be supplied with 300 million litres of milk a year until July 2020 under sale terms to Bega.\n\nBega\u2019s net debt increased $287.3 million, or 2.5 times EBITDA, after funding acquisitions and the additional milk at Koroit.\n\nWhile Morgans has a hold on the stock, Bell Potter has it as a buy with a target price of $5.50.\n\nBell Potter saw plenty of upside in the wake of the full-year results based largely on the drought in eastern Australia breaking sooner or later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo me there almost seems an inevitability about Bega becoming a target at some stage \u2014 Mark Topy, Select Equities analyst\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the current operating earnings of Bega are reflective of what the business is capable of generating under more normal seasonal conditions,\u201d analyst Jonathan Snape said.\n\nThe firm views Bega as a play on a return to normal rainfall and sees earnings growth from 2020-21 through the move to boost production of lactoferrin, a specialty protein used in health foods and infant formula.\n\nBega chairman Max Roberts said the past year would go down as one of the most difficult in dairy farming history with communities under strain and Bega facing intense competition for a diminishing pool of milk.\n\nPopular and respected Bega executive chairman Barry Irvin also took extended leave to battle cancer.\n\nDairy Australia has forecast milk production to fall by up to 5 per cent this year because of drought, high water and feed prices.\n\nBega\u2019s opening farmgate milk price for fiscal 2020 was $6.60 per kilogram of milk solids (compared to $5.85 a year earlier) and it increased the price to $6.75 by August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelect Equities analyst Mark Topy said Bega faced a major challenge in managing rising farmgate prices and trying to pass costs on to the domestic market.\n\nMr Topy said Fonterra had taken its eye off the ball in Australia with its milk supply estimated to have fallen from two billion litres to about 1.4 billion litres.\n\nHowever, he warned big players like Saputo, with about two billion litres, and Bega faced competition from a host of other companies chasing significant volumes for high margin products.\n\nSelect Equities has a hold on Bega but expects it to emerge in a strong position once milk supply bounces back.\n\nMr Topy said the premium Mengnui was willing to pay for Bellamy's, essentially an infant formula marketing company that relies on subcontractors, might spark renewed interest in Bega given its drought-affected share price, processing assets, retail footprint and solid brands.\n\n\"To me there almost seems an inevitability about Bega becoming a target at some stage,\" he said.", "description": "Diversified cheese maker faces another tough year but Lion sale and Fonterra uncertainty might open up new opportunities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f6dc75c2d664e45e766399770200453e3a3154f8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
