Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said of the caucus\u2019s lengthy to-do list, which could also include stalled legislation on health care and trade. \u201cSpending an extended period of time with my constituents, it\u2019s pretty obvious they just want us to get this stuff done.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders are weighing their options to block any more cash for the wall, wary of intensifying an ugly clash over the border wall and immigration that could shape the 2020 race.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), adding that Democrats should insist on providing zero new money for the wall, even as the White House has found ways to circumvent Congress to secure billions for the wall by shifting funds away from military construction projects.\n\nBut a funding fight over border security also risks exposing divides within the Democratic party \u2014 reigniting an emotional debate that nearly tore the caucus apart earlier this summer. And those tensions could complicate Democrats\u2019 efforts to complete their packed fall agenda.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that people are cruising for a bruising this September. I get the impression that people are trying to work things out,\u201d said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.). \u201cI suppose we\u2019re at a time where anything can happen. But I don\u2019t see or hear reason to think there\u2019s a blowup in September.\u201d\n\nPelosi and her deputies will face a maze of other demands from their caucus in the short three-week stretch of September, before lawmakers leave town again for two weeks to celebrate Jewish holidays.\n\nThis fall is seen as the final shot for some of Democrats\u2019 longtime legislative priorities \u2014 like a massive drug pricing bill that has vexed the caucus for months \u2014 before public attention drifts to the 2020 presidential contest.\n\nFor many moderates, it may be the last chance to finish negotiations on a trade pact with Mexico and Canada. And for progressives, there will be a hard push to advance impeachment proceedings before the start of the election year \u2014 a move that a majority of House Democrats now support.\n\nBut it could be immigration that consumes much of the caucus\u2019s energy ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline. Trump\u2019s wall is also expected to be a sticking point in a separate must-pass defense policy bill this fall.\n\nThe House plans to pass a \u201cclean\u201d short-term bill this month that will keep the government open until sometime around Thanksgiving \u2014 a move aimed at buying more time while House and Senate leaders negotiate a broader funding package.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if Senate Republicans \u2014 at the behest of Trump \u2014 will agree to any funding bill that omits more money for Trump\u2019s border wall. House Democrats, too, will have to unite their caucus behind a status quo funding bill that continues to fund Trump\u2019s border agencies.\n\n2020 Dems on the issues \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nImmigration: DACA Illegal Entry The Wall\n\nAny deal between Trump and Democrats on border security funding this fall will be tougher for many progressives to stomach after watching from afar as the White House implemented some of its most drastic action yet on immigration.\n\nAugust began with massive ICE raids at workplaces in Mississippi that led to hundreds of arrests, followed by a crackdown on green cards for immigrants who have used public aid like food stamps.\n\nThen the White House announced it was nixing the so-called \u201cFlores settlement\u201d \u2014 a landmark policy that ensured migrant children couldn\u2019t be detained indefinitely.\n\nAt the same time, the Pentagon formalized its plan to raid $3.6 billion from military projects. Dozens of Democrats have been left fuming as billions of dollars are sucked out of their home districts from sites like West Point Academy in New York, an elementary school for service members\u2019 families in Kentucky and a cybersecurity facility in Virginia. Even Republican Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee railed against the money grab.\n\n\u201cI think after everything that\u2019s happened, there\u2019s going to be a lot more interest in taking a more dramatic step,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky), referring to funding of contentious agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be in much of a mood to respond to [Department of Homeland Security] requests and the administration\u2019s requests,\u201d the House Budget Committee chairman said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe need to stand firm on this. I am certainly going to urge my leadership to stay at $0 and I hope we stay at $0,\u201d added Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), a member of the House spending panel.\n\nBut Democrats also acknowledge the tough balance of taking a hard line against Trump, without allowing government funding to lapse.\n\n\u201cI think we need to focus on making sure we don\u2019t have a government shutdown,\u201d Cuellar said.\n\nThis year\u2019s fight, of course, comes with particularly high stakes. Trump has just one more chance to persuade Congress to fully fund his border wall before the apex of his 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump and his circle of supporters are desperate to complete what he\u2019s promised will be a 500-mile barrier along the southern border by November 2020. So far, the White House has secured about 60 miles of replacement barrier \u2014 with not a single mile in a place that didn\u2019t previously have fencing.\n\n\u201cHopefully, he won\u2019t say he wants \u2018X amount of dollars for the fence, otherwise we\u2019re going to have a shutdown.\u2019 I don\u2019t think people want to have another shutdown,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cA lot is going to depend on how much emphasis the president is going to put on the wall.\u201d\n\n", "description": "A fight with Trump over his border wall, however, could fracture the Democratic caucus.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/aa/60/9ba7919b48e4992c85052d100ef8/190906-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
