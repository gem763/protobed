The agreement did not specify the area of the pullback.\n\nErdogan on Sunday said he expected the US to keep its promises and not use stalling tactics over the agreement brokered between the NATO allies, warning Turkey would resume its military operation if the deal faltered.\n\nHe had previously threatened the offensive will resume if the withdrawal is not completed within the five-day time window set out by the truce agreement.\n\nAl Jazeera's Stratford meanwhile, said there was continued disagreement between the Turkish leader and the SDF over the extent of the latter's withdrawal from the border region.\n\n\"President Erdogan wants this so-called 'safe zone' to be 450km long \u2026 and around 30km deep,\" Stratford said.\n\n\"But the SDF have said from day one of this ceasefire that they will be withdrawing their forces from an area considerably smaller than that, from Ras al-Ain to the town of Tal Abyad,\" he added.\n\n\"So it remains to be seen what kind of level of SDF withdrawal we are going to see in these remaining areas between now and Tuesday evening, when the ceasefire ends.\"", "description": "US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces pull out of border town of Ras al-Ain after ceasefire deal signed on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/28d99130140e4ca299a65a2b625c5b9f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
