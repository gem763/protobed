Free me!\"\n\nThe Raiders, in return, fined him -- which let the team void over $29 million in guarantees over the next two years if he wasn't on the team. Brown later requested his release from the team -- in another social media post.\n\nAfter hearing of his release, Brown posted another video in which he yelled \"free!\" to the camera and ran outside while flapping his arms like an eagle.\n\nANTONIO BROW RELEASED BY OAKLAND RAIDERS AFTER FRACTURED OFF-SEASON, REPORTED FEUD WITH GM OVER FINES, MONEY\n\nThe ESPN report would confirm what many analysts have suspected over the past week, that his social media antics were orchestrated to expedite his release from the Raiders. He most likely will need to cease his social media efforts going forward under the watchful eye of no-nonsense Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, the analysts said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAntonio Brown still isn't part of the Patriots yet and won't be around the team until he officially signs on Monday.
