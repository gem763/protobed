Much. Drama.\n\nBut Amber is adamant the ITV2 stars aren\u2019t rowing, but it\u2019s just natural they\u2019re drifting apart.\n\n\u2018The majority of the time it\u2019s not a feud, it\u2019s just life,\u2019 she continued. \u2018You\u2019ve got your friends, and you\u2019ve got people that you know, but you don\u2019t speak to them every day.\n\nAmber has stayed close to Anna Vakili since leaving the Love Island villa (Picture: Splash)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just exactly the same as that.\n\n\u2018Especially when you see what they said about you\u2026\u2019\n\nNoted\u2026\n\n\u2018I think it would be impossible to keep in touch with like 35 different people, maybe more than that,\u2019 she explained further. \u2018That would be impossible.\n\n\u2018In real life, you wouldn\u2019t get along with everybody. The majority of the girls I get along with really well.\u2019\n\nAmber penned a \u00a31million Miss Pap deal (Picture: Splash)\n\nAmber had a lot of eyes on her when she left the Love Island villa \u2013 with many questioning what her next step would be following her split from Greg O\u2019Shea.\n\nHowever, she revealed she doesn\u2019t see herself in competition with any of her co-stars \u2013 after Maura Higgins and India Reynolds unveiled Boohoo collections and Molly-Mae released a PrettyLittleThing line.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in competition because I\u2019m quite different,\u2019 she added. \u2018I feel like, if a certain brand wants to work with me, they wouldn\u2019t want to work with\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a reason why [they approached me]. All of us are very different in different ways. So I don\u2019t feel that side of the competition at all.\u2019\n\nAnd we\u2019re guessing that \u00a31million paycheque feels pretty good, too\u2026\n\nAmber Gill\u2019s Miss Pap collection is available now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
