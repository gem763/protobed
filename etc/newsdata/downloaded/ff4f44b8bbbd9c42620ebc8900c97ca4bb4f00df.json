Here's GM Les Snead's philosophy: 'We\u2019re not going to be scared'", "language": "en", "text": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 The dimmed lights create an intimate setting that soon provides a peek inside the mind of one of the NFL\u2019s most influential figures.\n\nEverything about him \u2014 the hooded sweatshirt, the blue baseball cap obscuring a haircut he\u2019s somewhat displeased with, and the syrupy Southern lilt \u2014 belies the frenetic pace of his racing thoughts and his never-ending quest to crush the competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be scared. But we\u2019re not going to be reckless,\u201d Los Angeles Rams general manager Les Snead said with a smile last Friday, as he opened up about his philosophy on building a team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThose words \u2014 uttered near the conclusion of a 45-minute sit-down interview with Yahoo Sports inside the team\u2019s defensive meeting room \u2014 proved to be a harbinger of yet another jaw-dropping move orchestrated by Snead. Two weeks before the NFL trade deadline, he reshaped his secondary in a matter of hours, and more importantly, left no doubt about whether or not the Rams still believe they can win it all in 2019.\n\nAfter acquiring center Austin Corbett from Cleveland, they traded cornerback Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens in order to set the stage for their biggest coup of the calendar year: Bringing Jalen Ramsey to L.A.\n\nThe Rams acquired Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey for a hefty price. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Rams traded two first-round picks (in 2020 and 2021) and a fourth-rounder (in 2021) in exchange for Jacksonville\u2019s disgruntled cornerback \u2014 a bold move that sent shock waves across social media and stunned many within NFL circles. While it may seem like the defending NFC champions are a shell of themselves on the field, Snead remains unchanged behind closed doors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlockbuster deals and big-money contracts have typified his tenure with the Rams, dating back to his 2012 arrival in St. Louis. And now, with his team mired in a three-game losing streak, \u201cSuper Bowl hangover\u201d questions hanging overhead and a new, $5 billion stadium on the horizon, Snead isn't about to stop being aggressive.\n\n\u201cWe only live once, so don\u2019t live your life scared,\u201d Snead told Yahoo Sports, only four days before orchestrating the Ramsey trade. \u201c\u2026 Any time you make a move, you do try to have protocols in place that can help you make sound decisions. But you\u2019re not playing for the tie. You\u2019re trying to go win.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nPart executive, part philosopher, part psychologist, the 48-year-old has always been meticulous in his mission of rebuilding the Rams from NFL doormat to proven winner. He\u2019s a voracious reader who spends as much time combing autobiographies and history books for insight he can apply to his daily life as he does studying his football opponents each week. The gluten-free dieter prides himself on being an outside-the-box thinker, a football mind who isn\u2019t afraid to gamble every now and then. And at this pivotal juncture, Snead doesn\u2019t really have a choice.\n\nThe L.A. luster has worn off these new-look Rams at the worst possible time.\n\nThe high-octane, Todd Gurley-powered offense that propelled them to Super Bowl LIII was instantly vanquished by Bill Belichick\u2019s masterful game plan. Since then, the Rams haven't looked the same.\n\nTalk of Gurley\u2019s arthritic knee, the subpar play of quarterback Jared Goff and questions about Sean McVay\u2019s genius and their disappearing defense are the backdrop to their current three-game skid \u2014 the first such losing streak of McVay\u2019s head-coaching tenure. And while they don\u2019t appear to be as desperate for fan support as their soon-to-be stadium roommates, the Los Angeles Chargers, last Sunday\u2019s loss to San Francisco (5-0) provided a depressing glimpse into the Rams\u2019 potential future if they fail to make the playoffs.\n\nBad teams have a hard time selling PSLs and season tickets. Also, generating buzz in a market like L.A. \u2014 where once-proud Rams faithfuls were forgotten about for two decades and later replaced by a transient, fickle fan base nestled next to Hollywood \u2014 is far more difficult than it appears.\n\nSnead, however, downplayed the pressure of repaving those inroads.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the positive: The Rams had a history here,\u201d he said, completely unaware that, only 48 hours later, his team would be bullied by the 49ers, 20-7, on a day when Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was awash in shades of red. \u201cSo there\u2019s an element of, \u2018You\u2019re coming home.\u2019 The difficulty is, there\u2019s that gap. \u2026There was this generation that was left out of seeing the Rams live. So I think that would be the challenge. The nice thing is, we have a nice core fan base, but it\u2019s grabbing back that generation when the Rams weren\u2019t here, and grabbing their kids, and saying, \u2018Come on back to Mom and Dad\u2019s hometown team.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe addition of Ramsey, one of the league\u2019s top cornerbacks, won\u2019t assuage concern over Gurley\u2019s dwindling production, nor will it quiet the noise surrounding Goff\u2019s struggles, improve the Rams\u2019 poor offensive line play or help their lack of offensive cohesion. But signing Ramsey to a long-term deal will be key for a franchise looking to make a splash \u2014 and draw more fans \u2014 in its new stadium.\n\nAnd all it took was surrendering first-round picks. Again.\n\nThe Rams haven\u2019t had a first-round pick in the draft since 2016, the year they traded picks with Tennessee in order to select Goff No. 1 overall.\n\nSnead, as we\u2019ve come to see, is anything but apprehensive.\n\nLes Snead has never been shy in gunning for a big-name player during his run as Rams GM. (Keith Birmingham/Getty Images)\n\nHe kicked off his stint as general manager in dramatic fashion, trading their No. 2 overall pick to Washington in 2012 (which the Redskins would later use to select quarterback Robert Griffin III) in exchange for three first-rounders and a second-rounder. Snead\u2019s wheeling and dealing continued for almost a decade, as he routinely sought ways to transform the Rams into the type of team he had always envisioned \u2014 younger, better, tougher, more balanced. It\u2019s the reason defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Gurley and Goff were drafted. It\u2019s the reason Snead executed trades for cornerbacks Aqib Talib (who is expected to go on injured reserve this week) and Peters, wide receiver Brandin Cooks, linebacker Dante Fowler Jr., and signed defensive end Ndamukong Suh to a one-year deal last offseason. It\u2019s the reason Snead made Donald and Gurley the highest-paid players at their respective positions, and in extending Goff gave him $110 million guaranteed, the most in NFL history.\n\n\u201cUltimately, they performed very well,\u201d Snead said, explaining the thought process behind those hefty contracts. \u201cWe believe in our people. They\u2019re as important to this organization as anything. Those three are very important.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s inherent risk in every transaction. It's especially true when Snead\u2019s \u201cabstract\u201d brain and \u201ctelescopic\u201d thinking take over.\n\nBuilding through the draft is a slow, deliberate process that requires a long-term vision and unwavering resolve. Meanwhile, acquiring top-tier talent via free agency or trades can yield faster results for a team that is theoretically a few pieces away. But the future salary-cap implications of current contracts eventually must be addressed.\n\nThe margin for error in the NFL is infinitesimal. And with each year that passes, teams find that the window for success stays open for only so long.\n\n\u201cYou always feel like you\u2019re being chased,\u201d Snead said, \u201cespecially when you\u2019re in the NFL and there are 32 teams.\u201d\n\nHe succeeded in rebuilding the Rams from NFL laughingstock to Super Bowl contender. Now, the challenge is repeating as NFC champions and proving that they can be just like Belichick\u2019s Patriots: immune to the so-called \u201cSuper Bowl hangover\u201d \u2014 a term Snead dismissed out of hand.\n\nBut as focused as the Rams GM is on the bigger picture, he insisted he\u2019s not thinking ahead to January or February.\n\n\u201cEach day, each year we\u2019re accumulating young talent. If you can persevere through, I call it \u2018the build,\u2019 there will be a breakthrough,\u201d Snead said, recalling the franchise\u2019s transformation from perennial loser to Super Bowl runner-up. \u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s just focus on building a core. Have a clear, defined intention of where you\u2019re at in the phase and go dominate that phase.\u201d\n\nHe later denied feeling more pressure to win in order to ease the team\u2019s transition into its new home, noting that their objective would be the same whether they were set to play in a new stadium or California Lutheran University across the street.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily add a new pressure,\u201d Snead said. \u201cI think we\u2019re aware of the phase we\u2019re in: We earned two NFC West championships. We earned an NFC championship. So with that comes an efficacy, a belief that we can win the next game. ... That\u2019s the good thing that alleviates some of the pressure you\u2019re talking about \u2014 the new stadium, Super Bowl. We\u2019d rather be in this phase than that phase where we were persevering through \u2018the build.\u2019 This one\u2019s more fun.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Blockbuster deals and big contracts have typified his tenure with the Rams.
