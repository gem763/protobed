And the veteran No 8 Parisse has pulled no punches in criticising tournament organisers for not relocating the fixture or altering the match day, instead simply cancelling the encounter and awarding both teams two points.\n\nRugby World Cup: England v France off and Japan v Scotland under threat from Typhoon Hagibis Read more\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to know that we won\u2019t have the chance to play a match against one of the great teams,\u201d said Parisse. \u201cIf New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn\u2019t like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan.\n\n\u201cSure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we\u2019d have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team.\n\n\u201cThe alternative is plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\u201d\n\nThe hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini, who is 34, had to struggle to recover from a bad knee injury to make Italy\u2019s squad and was due to be given his first action in Japan against New Zealand. It was to be in recognition of his 13 years and more than 100 Tests of commitment in the front row.\n\nConor O\u2019Shea described \u201chorrible\u201d disappointment among his players. Ghiraldini reportedly shed tears after a training session when news broke that the game had been cancelled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we would have beaten them, but you want to finish on the pitch,\u201d said the Italy coach. \u201cAnything can happen and you\u2019re very emotional especially for Leonardo Ghiraldini, who missed his last chance to play in an Italy jersey, and to hear that your international career is finished after training is tough to take.\n\nScotland happy to play behind closed doors if necessary, says Townsend Read more\n\n\u201cThese guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field.\u201d\n\nThe New Zealand coach, Steve Hansen, admitted he would have been frustrated had he been on the receiving end of the raw deal that Italy now find themselves lamenting.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d had a choice, we would have rather played Friday [instead of Saturday] but it wasn\u2019t our choice, it was out of our control,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cWe have to back World Rugby\u2019s decision and if other teams miss out, it\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019ll be disappointing.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be really ruthless, then it\u2019s all about making sure you win the games on the way through because everyone knew this could be a possibility.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty hard-nosed, though, because I know if we were in their situation we\u2019d be disappointed not to have the opportunity to get there. So yes, there\u2019s a lot of sympathy for them. But the right decisions are being made, because it\u2019s all about safety.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup. If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it\u2019ll be 40 degrees.\n\n\u201cIf you play it later, then that\u2019s when we are finished for Christmas, so you\u2019d have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.\u201d", "description": "Sergio Parisse has hit out at World Rugby\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d decision to cancel Italy\u2019s World Cup match against New Zealand", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c25b5a0892c5456746bea9bd41626ca2494793d/0_0_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8928d253f21368b1203a20ee3a749e6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
