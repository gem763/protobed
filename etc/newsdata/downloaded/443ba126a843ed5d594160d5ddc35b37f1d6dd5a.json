Alcohol and drugs helped me to numb all of those unwanted feelings and emotions.\n\nRemembering her first sip of alcohol at 13, she added: 'After that first drink, I couldn't stop. I drank myself into a blackout that night. The next day I couldn't wait to do it again. I loved the warm, numb feeling it gave me. And from that moment on it was downhill.\n\n'After I was in a bad car accident in 2011 I was prescribed Norco from the pain and I fell in love with the feeling they gave me. From then on, my addiction began to spiral out of control.'\n\nAshley found herself in a string of toxic relationships where she was taken advantage of and abused by men.\n\nBefore long, Ashley was skipping school to get drunk, and attended parties where she was introduced to weed, cocaine, ecstasy, meth, cough syrup and painkiller pills\n\nPictured: Ashley is seen at the height of her addiction, when her drug and drink problem spiraled out of control\n\nAshley found herself in a string of toxic relationships where she was taken advantage of and abused by men\n\nShockingly, Ashley ended up taking up to 40 pills a day, drinking, doing cocaine and using other drugs in order to help her wean off pills\n\nAt 21, she fell pregnant with her first child, Rylann, now seven, but found the strength to ditch alcohol and drugs for the duration of her pregnancy.\n\nBut after giving birth in August 2012 she was given painkiller Norco for pain and she became hooked once her prescription ran out.\n\nShe said: 'It was a miracle that I stayed away from alcohol and drugs that entire time. As soon as I gave birth to her and they gave me pain meds, it was back downhill again. I started abusing pills when she was two months old and continued breastfeeding the next year and a half while taking them,' she said.\n\n'All the while her dad was smoking OxyContin and heroin. I was breastfeeding at the time but just told myself I'm only taking a few so it can't be affecting my daughter through my breastmilk, though I'm sure it was. I felt guilty and felt like a sh***y mom but of course I continued to take them.\n\n'That toxic relationship came to an end pretty quickly. I moved into my grandma's guest house with my best friend because I couldn't afford to be on my own especially with my daughter. They made sure I always had a job or was in school.'\n\nBut the new mother started to go to a dealer to get the pills and convinced herself that she wouldn't be causing her daughter any harm despite breastfeeding.\n\nAt 21, she fell pregnant with her first child, Rylann, now seven, but found the strength to ditch alcohol and drugs for the duration of her pregnancy\n\nAshley, who is pictured pregnant with Rylann, managed to stay clean and sober while carrying her daughter\n\nShockingly, Ashley ended up taking up to 40 pills a day, drinking, doing cocaine and using other drugs in order to help her wean off pills.\n\nSpeaking about her daughter, she said: 'If someone couldn't take her, I would just bring the party to me.\n\n'My daughter would wake up in the morning to find me still loaded from the night before and random strangers around the house. I thank God to this day that she was too little to remember any of that.'\n\nDepressed and feeling guilty for not being a good mother, Ashley's weight dropped to just 93lbs and after being kicked out of cosmetology school, she begged her dad to help get her into treatment, which he did.\n\nAfter 45 days in rehab, Ashley came out feeling like a new person but after getting back with an ex-boyfriend she soon started drinking again.\n\nHowever with her family's encouragement to attend support meetings and get a sponsor, Ashley became sober again for the sake of herself and her child.\n\nJack and Ashley, pictured on their wedding day in August 2018, conceived their son, Jackson, before tying the knot\n\nIt was at an alcoholics and narcotics anonymous meeting that Ashley met Jack, and they fell in love and have supported each other throughout their respective recoveries\n\nAshley has been clean and sober for over two years now, and she hopes to inspire other people with her story\n\nAfter marrying Jack, 35, the pair welcomed their son Jackson, now one, and live happily with Ashley's daughter Rylann, seven\n\nAshley, who shares her story on her Instagram @ashleydoherty.recovery, said: 'I forced myself to be strong for once and cut out the toxic people I had always surrounded myself with because I knew if I didn't I wouldn't stay clean. Doing so changed my entire life.'\n\nIt was at an alcoholics and narcotics anonymous meeting that Ashley met her now husband, Jack, and they fell in love and have supported each other throughout their respective recoveries.\n\n'My husband and I met each other at a meeting shortly after we had both got out of rehab. Technically you're not supposed to date for a year so that you can focus on yourself and the 12 steps but the connection we had was undeniable and the best thing I had ever felt,' she said.\n\n'We both make up where each other is lacking. We would attend meetings every single week and would spend time with our group of friends in recovery.\n\n'Our relationship is so loving and so beautiful it's something I've never experienced before. Neither of us could even imagine picking up a drink or drug because we know it would completely ruin every amazing thing we have going for us.'\n\nAfter getting married, the pair welcomed a child together, Jackson, who is now one, and Ashley has increased her weight to a healthy 115lbs.\n\nThe now-mother-of-two did not drink or do drugs while she was pregnant with Rylann\n\nAfter getting married, the pair welcomed a child together, Jackson, and Ashley is now a healthy 115lbs and hopes to be able to inspire others with her story\n\nAshley and Jack on their wedding day in August 2018\n\nShe hopes that by sharing her story, she can inspire other people to overcome their own battles with drugs and alcohol.\n\nSpeaking about her life, she said: 'I now have a life I would have never imagined I'd ever have. I believed you couldn't live life without alcohol or drugs.\n\n'I now have been clean and sober for over two years and I love my life. I met my husband at a meeting in recovery. We had a baby. I got accepted back into cosmetology school and got my license.\n\n'I finally have confidence and I'm finally proud of myself. I've never felt so peaceful and so happy in my entire life. It would have never happened if it weren't for recovery.'\n\nShe added: 'Your life is more important than what others may think. Make friends in recovery. That is what helped me stay clean. You have to cut out the negative influences and toxic relationships in your life or there's no way you will stay clean and sober.\n\n'The friendships you form in recovery will be such an important part in helping keep you clean and sober because we all understand one another and offer one another inspiration and motivation.'", "description": "Ashley Doherty, 29, from Riverside, California, would breastfeed her daughter whilst high on painkillers at drug-fuelled parties, before turning her life around.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20319010-0-image-a-2_1572343343669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
