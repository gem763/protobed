REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nEconomists believe China\u2019s economic growth likely cooled further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% in April-June, but they differ on whether the slowing trend could persist despite a raft of government policy measures.\n\nEconomic activity worsened in August, with growth in industrial production at its weakest in 17-1/2 years, as the U.S.-China trade war dented business confidence, investment and domestic consumption.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk for Q3 GDP to be below 6.0%,\u201d said Zhaopeng Xing, an economist at ANZ.\n\n\u201cBut we expect September will see a jump in fixed-asset investment because many gift projects for 70th anniversary will be confirmed to be in the statistics at the quarter end. So we maintain our forecast of Q3 GDP 6.1%,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nUBS expects China\u2019s economic growth to slow to 5.5% in 2020 from expected pace of 6.0% in 2019. Growth will slow further in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact from higher U.S. tariffs, UBS\u2019s China economist Tao Wang said.\n\nBeijing is targeting 6%-6.5% growth for 2019, and government analysts expect the stimulus measures will prop-up the economy.\n\n\u201cWe forecast third-quarter growth would be 6.1%, before recovering somewhat in the fourth quarter, to 6.2%,\u201d said Zhang Yuxian, head of economic forecasting department of State Information Center, a top government think tank.\n\n\u201cThis round of polices, including fiscal, monetary and structural policies, will definitely be reflected in the fourth quarter, otherwise such policies will be ineffective,\u201d Zhang told a group of foreign reporters late Wednesday.\n\nThat would ensure the economy will grow between 6.2% and 6.3% this year, he said, in line with the government target.\n\nChen Wenling, chief economist at China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), a well-connected think tank, told reporters that she expected growth to be around 6.2% this year and around 6% in 2020.\n\nZhang Yansheng, another economist at CCIEE, said he cannot rule out the possibility that quarterly growth could dip below 6% in the future, but he did not specify a timeframe.\n\nMORE PRESSURE ON JOBS\n\nDespite a slew of growth-boosting measures since last year, the world\u2019s second-largest economy has yet to stabilize. That explains why most private economists remain sober about China\u2019s growth outlook as demand at home and abroad weakens.\n\nAnalysts say Beijing needs to roll out more stimulus to ward off a sharper slowdown as the protracted trade war with the United States takes a toll on businesses and consumers.\n\nRoom for stimulus is limited as policymakers worry about rising debt risks and property bubbles, although accelerating consumer inflation has yet to become a big concern, policy insiders said.\n\nThe market is watching whether the central bank, which has cut reserve requirements seven times since early 2018, will lower its Loan Prime Rate (LPR) on Friday.\n\nLouis Kuijs at Oxford Economics forecast China\u2019s GDP to grow 6.1% this year and 5.7% in 2020.\n\nEmployment pressures have been partly offset by a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country\u2019s demographic changes, analysts said.\n\nChen at CCIEE said the trade war has hit the factory jobs sector, although the overall employment remains steady.\n\n\u201cSome small and medium-sized firms have gone bankrupt due to the impact from the Sino-U.S. trade war,\u201d she said, citing a private survey that some 4 million jobs have been affected.\n\nChina\u2019s nationwide survey-based jobless rate was at 5.2% in August, easing slightly from July, according to government data.\n\nUBS\u2019s Wang also cautioned about the jobs outlook.\n\n\u201cWe also see more pressure on employment in end 2019 and early 2020 after the last tranche of tariffs take effect. This, plus the negative impact of trade war and slowing property activities, will likely depress consumption growth,\u201d Wang said.", "description": "China's economic growth risks slipping below the lower-end of Beijing 2019 target of 6% in the third quarter or over the next year, analysts warn, but government economists are slightly more optimistic as they expect stimulus to help stave off a sharper slowdown.", "authors": ["Kevin Yao", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431543958&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0LS", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
