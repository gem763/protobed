The previous Christmas, Mrs Thatcher had defied her advisers\u2019 suggestion that she call Chancellor Kohl and wish him the compliments of the season.\n\nShe said she would never be able think of enough to say to him to keep their chat going beyond a cursory \u2018Happy Christmas\u2019.\n\nChancellor Kohl presented Mrs Thatcher with a bottle of what she was later to describe as \u2018filthy sweet wine\u2019. On her flight back to England, she exclaimed to Charles Powell: \u2018Oh, Charles, that man is so German!\u2019\n\nAs his girth attested, Kohl liked his food. In fact, he could be called something of a glutton. His favourite dish was Saumagen, which literally means \u2018sow\u2019s stomach\u2019.\n\nMrs Thatcher, on the other hand, was a much pickier eater, favouring no-nonsense food such as grapefruit or boiled eggs.\n\nAs Charles Moore narrates in his brilliant new biography of Mrs Thatcher, before their meal together, Kohl had convinced himself that she would gain a better understanding of Germany if she were given a chance to tuck into his favourite dish with him on his home turf.\n\nAccordingly, he made sure they were both served the fatty Saumagen. Charles Powell, Mrs Thatcher\u2019s private secretary, would never forget the sight of Mrs Thatcher struggling with it.\n\nAs his girth attested, Kohl liked his food. In fact, he could be called something of a glutton. His favourite dish was Saumagen, which literally means \u2018sow\u2019s stomach\u2019. The two leaders are pictured together\n\n\u2018She kept chasing it round her plate. She ended up trying to hide it under her fork.\u2019\n\nBefore she left, Chancellor Kohl presented Mrs Thatcher with a bottle of what she was later to describe as \u2018filthy sweet wine\u2019.\n\nOn her flight back to England, she exclaimed to Charles Powell: \u2018Oh, Charles, that man is so German!\u2019\n\nCoincidentally, in her newly published autobiography, Lady Glenconner describes Princess Margaret facing similar difficulties with food.\n\nThe Glenconners had invited the princess to dinner. For some reason, Lord Glenconner \u2014 aka the irascible Colin Tennant \u2014 had hit on the idea that she loved ox tongue, and he had nipped off to Harrods to get some.\n\n\u2018He brought back a box filled with curled-up great tongues,\u2019 recalls Lady Glenconner. \u2018They looked far from appealing. In fact, they looked perfectly disgusting \u2014 and even worse, when we all sat down to dinner, Princess Margaret took one look at the solid grey tongue and went green. So did Tony (Snowdon). The tongues met the plates with a thud. We hid them politely behind our vegetables, and no one said a word. Suffice to say, they never returned to dinner . . .\u2019\n\nI suspect each of us has a particular dish we cannot abide. I share Princess Margaret\u2019s distaste for tongue.\n\nI have a vivid memory of the exact moment, as a child, when my knife encountered a tough vein in the slice of tongue on my plate.\n\nIt suddenly dawned on me that the dish was called \u2018tongue\u2019 not by chance, but because it actually was a real tongue.\n\nEver since then, I have been unable to eat it. Nor am I keen on the jelly around pork pies, but that is another story.\n\nSchool food is, of course, famously disgusting. John Lennon offered a version of the old school chant, \u2018Yellow matter custard, green slop pie, all mixed together with a dead dog\u2019s eye,\u2019 in the Beatles song I Am The Walrus.\n\nIn her hilarious book about girls\u2019 boarding schools, Ysenda Maxtone Graham relates the extreme lengths to which girls used to go to avoid eating particularly disgusting dishes.\n\n\u2018One method was to throw small handfuls of food on to the floor \u2014 always remembering to throw it to the left or right so it couldn\u2019t be traced to you. Rats and mice lived on gristly meat and gravy from discarded handfuls of stew that found its way through cracks. When they finished these, they ate through the wiring.\u2019\n\nSchool food is, of course, famously disgusting. John Lennon offered a version of the old school chant, \u2018Yellow matter custard, green slop pie, all mixed together with a dead dog\u2019s eye,\u2019 in the Beatles song I Am The Walrus\n\nFaced with pilchards, some girls would put them into their pockets, which would then smell of pilchard for the rest of term.\n\n\u2018Rosemary Chambers at Woldingham put her semolina into her pocket and it started to ooze out at the moment when the school gathered to say their nightly prayers.\u2019\n\nThese days, most schools have improved their food, or at least made it blander. Those of us who used to enjoy watching our schoolmates turning green now have to tune into I\u2019m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! to experience similar delights.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite so heartwarming on a cold winter\u2019s evening as watching a fallen disc-jockey, cashiered Conservative MP or former Emmerdale actor being obliged to eat the testicle of a kangaroo. If only Chancellor Kohl were still alive, he would no doubt wipe the board.", "description": "CRAIG BROWN: As his girth attested, Helmut Kohl liked his food.
