Not after those 109 pitches, the last of which got him out of a bases-loaded situation and led to that full-body flex. Not after he followed a perfect relief outing in Game 2 with a vital seven-inning, one-run, four-hit, three-walk, seven-strikeout performance that was the backbone of a 6-1 victory in Game 4 in which Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s three-run homer was the big blow.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlight to Los Angeles? Hop on Max. He\u2019s back.\n\nMax Scherzer and the Nationals beat Dodgers, 6-1, to force Game 5 in L.A.\n\nThat he was able to provide that opportunity was hardly guaranteed Monday afternoon. The Nationals\u2019 ace had a rocky year with a difficult-to-grasp injury, made rehab starts at the major league level, posted an un-Max-like ERA of 4.74 ERA down the stretch, walked the first hitter he faced in the postseason and allowed a homer to the second.\n\nWhen that wild-card game against Milwaukee opened last week, Scherzer contained competing forces. On a random Tuesday in June when it\u2019s his turn to start, his glare could scare a hardened criminal. In the postseason, somehow he gets more amped. Given the stakes and a slight tendency to overthrow, that\u2019s not okay.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy biggest thing with Max is \u2014 as we all know \u2014 he\u2019s going to come out fired up,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cSo for him to come out in the first one or two innings, kind of settle down, that\u2019s going to be the telltale.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMan, did he want the ball. He was only three days removed from his last appearance, this one at Dodger Stadium, 14 pitches in which he struck out the side in a stirring Game 2 victory that gave the Nats a split in L.A. Yet on Sunday, when he had no business talking about pitching, he was talking about pitching.\n\n\u201cTypical Max,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to pinch-hit. He\u2019s ready to pinch-run. He said, \u2018I could pitch an inning.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Hey, buddy, you know, if we had to, you might pitch 140 pitches tomorrow, so just get your rest.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nMartinez was only 31 short. But you get the kind of conversation he might hear Wednesday, when the Nats will try to advance to the NL Championship Series for the first time in club history. Stephen Strasburg will start, and Washington expects excellence from a pitcher whose postseason ERA is now 0.64. Scherzer will be there, some cross between a puppy and an attack dog: \u201cCan I have the ball? How about now? When? What about now? Now?\u201d Tongue out. Pantpantpantpantpant.\n\nAD\n\nThe good part Monday: Even after Justin Turner, the Dodgers\u2019 relentless third baseman, greeted him with a two-out, solo homer in the first, Scherzer wasn\u2019t throwing 99 mph with his four-seam fastball. That sounds impressive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some fun with the other guys in the clubhouse,\u201d Scherzer said Sunday. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s just a mentality of going out there with everything on the line. . . . I mean, it\u2019s been intense. So you\u2019re going to get the best out of me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExcept the best of Scherzer is dialed perhaps a notch back. And that\u2019s where he settled in on Monday, his fastball at 94 mph, even-keeled. His first trip through the Dodgers\u2019 lineup featured only one strikeout \u2014 and that was of opposing pitcher Rich Hill. By the fourth, the fastball was up to 97 mph to strike out Gavin Lux, and then he rang up the side in the fifth.\n\nAD\n\nAnd still, here he was, pitching in a 1-1 game. For so many of these Nationals pitchers in so many of these postseason games, there\u2019s just no wiggle room.\n\nIn the Nats\u2019 24 playoff games starting in 2012, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter the lineup chosen that night or the team fielded that year. Get to October, and the bats cool down with the weather. Over the past eight seasons, they have been among the best offensive teams in the game \u2014 a .257 batting average, .326 on-base percentage and .421 slugging percentage. That .747 on-base-plus-slugging percentage might not look terribly sexy, but it\u2019s fifth in all of baseball and second (to the Dodgers) in the NL since 2012.\n\nAD\n\nHeaded into Monday night, do you even want to know the playoff numbers for the Nats? Consider this a spoiler alert. Read on at your own peril.\n\nAD\n\nThat would be .206/.285/.329 for a .614 OPS.\n\nDeep breaths. Remember, they won Monday night.\n\nOkay, now think about how unlikely that is. That run included the best of Ian Desmond and Jayson Werth, the burst onto the scene of Bryce Harper, Zimmerman\u2019s prime years, the savvy of Daniel Murphy and contributions from role players past \u2014 Michael Morse and Adam LaRoche, Danny Espinosa and Wilson Ramos, on and on.\n\nThe lack of production in the playoffs has put an inordinate amount of pressure on the Nats\u2019 rotation. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s how they\u2019re built, and the current rotation has three pitchers who could be paid $525 million over the course of their contracts.\n\nAD\n\nBut the angst over past Nats losses has so often centered around the pitching. Why couldn\u2019t Drew Storen get one more strike in 2012? Why did Matt Williams lift Jordan Zimmermann against the San Francisco Giants in 2014? Why did Dusty Baker leave Scherzer in against the Dodgers in 2016? What the heck happened to Scherzer in his inning of relief against the Chicago Cubs in 2017?\n\nAD\n\nSo once Zimmerman belted a Pedro B\u00e1ez offering through the wind in the fifth inning Monday night, Scherzer was a rare entity around here: A starting pitcher who could breathe. The bases-loaded situation came in the seventh \u2014 a single and two walks, as he was tiring. But it was with a five-run lead.\n\nAnd so Scherzer went to work. With one out, he faced pinch hitter Chris Taylor with a full count \u2014 and got him to swing through a slider. Martinez left Scherzer in to face left-handed Joc Pederson, who could produce a grand slam with one of his sweet swings. Scherzer\u2019s response: a fouled-off fastball and a change-up Pederson rolled over.\n\nSo then came the body flex. Next comes the flight to Los Angeles. Wait for the pleas to pitch Wednesday \u2014 when the Nats could finally advance.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nAD", "description": "Scherzer followed a perfect relief outing in Game 2 with a vital seven-inning, one-run, four-hit, three-walk, seven-strikeout performance that was the backbone of a Game 4 victory.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T2eFqMdnYokBPxTX68tiNUADy5A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/22JT4FHJOMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
