Probably lay low and focus on putting out this fire. But you see, you\u2019re not Donald Trump, because if you were Donald Trump, you would start a whole new fire,\u201d said Trevor Noah.\n\nThe Daily Show host dedicated a big segment of his program Monday night to the latest controversy surrounding President Trump: At 11 p.m. Sunday night, he took it upon himself to announce that the U.S. would be withdrawing its troops from northern Syria in order to pave the way for a Turkish invasion, thereby abandoning the Kurdish allies who\u2019ve fought alongside American soldiers to vanquish ISIS, and appealing to the desires of despots Erdogan and Assad (and, by extension, Putin).\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, Kurdish forces are currently holding many of the 10,000 captured ISIS fighters, so leaving the Kurds to the slaughter is not only unconscionable, but could also allow ISIS to rebuild. Officials at the Pentagon reported being \u201cblindsided\u201d by the move.\n\n\u201cOK, this is just insane. At 11 p.m. last night President Trump announced\u2014at 11 p.m.\u2014that the U.S. would be pulling its troops out of a key part of Syria. Even crazier is that he didn\u2019t tell the Pentagon,\u201d offered Noah.\n\nAfter receiving blowback from those who routinely kiss his tuchis\u2014including former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, and even his beloved Fox News, Trump issued the following message (via Twitter, of course):\n\n\u201cOK, OK! No, no, no! Before you judge Trump, he is technically correct: There is nobody who matches his wisdom,\u201d joked Noah, adding, \u201cNo other person had the wisdom to stare directly into a solar eclipse.\u201d\n\nThe comedian did, however, have some advice for the Kurds to get on Trump\u2019s good side: \u201cKurdish forces, you need to phone Trump, and you need to tell him you have dirt on Joe Biden\u2014but if he wants it, he\u2019s going to have to give you military aid, or as I like to call it, a kurd pro quo.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host had a field day with Trump\u2019s latest wild claim amid his widely criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and abandon our Kurdish allies.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_715,w_1272,x_0,y_43/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570510227/Screen_Shot_2019-10-08_at_12.34.19_AM_uwrepv", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
