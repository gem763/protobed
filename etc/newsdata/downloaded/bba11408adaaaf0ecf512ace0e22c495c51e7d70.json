The sources who talked to ABC News did caution that it's unclear if the calls being stored were done so for national security or for political concerns.\n\nOne source said it became \"basically standard operating procedure\" for many of the conversations Trump has had during his time in office.\n\nThe sources would not specify if any countries were treated differently than others. Decisions on which calls were put into the server, according to sources, were handled by members of the NSC, State Department and White House Counsel's office. The former career official said the measures taken seemed to solve the leak problem.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nThis comes as the first of several joint depositions is set to take place on Capitol Hill next week involving various investigative committees that have begun an impeachment inquiry.\n\nABC News has learned, in a release from the house oversight committee, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who up until May 2019 served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, is slated to sit for a deposition on Oct. 1.\n\nOn Friday, Trump spent the day in back-to-back meetings at the White House with his top aides, including his communications team, members of the White House Counsel's team and his personal counsel, sources told ABC News.\n\nDespite that, Trump's lead personal counsel, Jay Sekulow, told ABC News that, at this time, \"No war room is being set up -- we will respond appropriately.\"\n\nTing Shen/Xinhua via Getty Images, FILE\n\nSome top aides believe the faster this moves the better it will be for Trump's reelection. Privately, sources described a mixed bag, with a president who has been at times upbeat yet intent on ensuring no more leaks from the White House.\n\nAs part of Trump's day of meetings, he met with NRA Chief Wayne La Pierre. According to sources familiar with the conversation, the meeting focused on gun control but also about how the NRA could support Trump as he faces impeachment.\n\n\"The NRA is not inclined to discuss private conversations with the president,\" said Andrew Arulanandam, managing director of NRA Public Affairs. \"The NRA categorically denies any discussion occurred about special arrangements pertaining to the NRA's support of the president and vice versa.\"", "description": "The Trump administration", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-departs-ap-ps-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
