Most recent three-game skid was first three games of RB Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension in 2017. \u2026 Elliott needs 66 yards rushing to join Edgerrin James and LaDainian Tomlinson as only NFL backs to reach 4,500 yards rushing and 1,250 yards receiving in first 50 games. Elliott has 1,291 yards receiving going into his 46th game. \u2026 Prescott facing Jets for first time, leaving Patriots, Bills as only teams he hasn\u2019t faced - but plays those two next month. Passed for career-best 463 yards, but also matched career high with three INTs against Packers and has at least one pick in four straight games, longest streak in his three-plus seasons in NFL. \u2026 WR Amari Cooper is first Dallas receiver with multiple 200-yard receiving games after going for career-high 226 against Packers. Had one before last year\u2019s trade from Oakland, so is fifth NFL receiver with at least three 200-yard outings, joining Calvin Johnson and Jerry Rice (four apiece) and Isaac Bruce, Julio Jones (three each). \u2026 Cowboys have allowed two straight opponents to rush for more than 100 yards. It has been two years since three straight opponents reached triple digits on ground. \u2026 Jets off to worst start in 16 years, matching 2003 team under Herman Edwards that also opened 0-4. Looking to avoid first 0-5 start since 1-15 season under Rich Kotite in 1996. \u2026 QB Sam Darnold to make first start since season opener after missing last three games while recovering from mononucleosis. He was 28 of 41 for 175 yards with TD in Week 1. \u2026 New York has just 233 yards of total offense in last two games - combined - with Luke Falk starting at QB. Jets had 105 against New England on Sept. 22 and 128 at Philadelphia last week. \u2026 RB Le\u2019Veon Bell has been early-season workhorse for Jets with 206 yards rushing on 71 carries and team-leading 27 catches for 166 yards and TD, but still waiting for breakout game. \u2026 WR Vyncint Smith had 19-yard touchdown run on reverse in Jets debut last week. It was first TD run by Jets WR since Chris Owusu in 2014. \u2026 TE Chris Herndon eligible to return from four-game suspension for violating NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy, but injured hamstring last Friday while working out and not expected to play. \u2026 Jets have two INT returns for TDs (C.J. Mosley and Jamal Adams) and two safeties (Jordan Jenkins and Brian Poole). \u2026 Mosley likely to miss fourth straight game while recovering from groin injury. \u2026 LB Neville Hewitt, filling in for Mosley, leads team with 34 total tackles and two sacks. One of three players in NFL this season with 25 or more tackles, more than one sack and an INT. \u2026 LB Brandon Copeland likely to make season debut after serving four-game suspension for violating NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers. \u2026 Fantasy tip: Cooper could be in for another huge game, facing Jets secondary that has been shaky. Emerging Cowboys WR Michael Gallup should also be firmly in your lineup this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "DALLAS (3-2) at NEW YORK JETS (0-4)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
