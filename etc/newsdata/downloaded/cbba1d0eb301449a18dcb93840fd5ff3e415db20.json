If they did have Ebola, they would have been just the fifth patient to ever be diagnosed on European soil.\n\nIt is not currently clear where they had visited. However, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been battling an outbreak for more than a year.\n\nThe suspected case was not the first Ebola scare in Sweden. In January, another patient was feared to have been struck down with the lethal virus.\n\nThe young man was kept in isolation at the University Hospital in Uppsala before it was revealed that he did not have the infection.\n\nMedics in Sweden are investigating a suspected case of Ebola after a patient was rushed to Skane University Hospital in Lund with symptoms linked to the killer virus\n\nThe Ebola death toll in the Democratic Republic of Congo tops 2,000 a year after the outbreak was declared, government data shows\n\nIt comes just months after an Ebola outbreak in the DRC, the second biggest in history, was declared an international emergency.\n\nThe death toll in the African nation has soared past 2,100 and the number of cases has hit 3,200, according to figures.\n\nEbola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years.\n\nThat epidemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.\n\nCases of Ebola, named after the River Ebola in the DRC where it was first spotted, were reported in 10 countries - including eight in the US.\n\nMany aid agencies volunteered to help stop it spreading, including British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who was left critically ill by the deadly disease.\n\nShe became the first case to be diagnosed on British soil and spent almost a month in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north-west London.\n\nMs Cafferkey was readmitted to hospitals with Ebola complications twice in 2016.\n\nA Spanish healthcare worker became the first person to catch Ebola outside of Africa in October 2014, after caring for a patient repatriated from Sierra Leone. She recovered after a month-long stay in hospital.\n\nThe virus was then detected on Italian soil in May, when a healthcare worker flew back to Rome after volunteering in Sierra Leone. He did not display symptoms for three days and was allowed home from hospital the following month.\n\nEbola was first recorded on European soil in 1976, when a former lab technician accidentally pricked his finger with an Ebola sample.\n\nGeoffrey Platt revealed he spent 40 days in quarantine after the incident, while he was working at the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire.\n\nEbola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, but scientists believe antelope, porcupines, gorillas and chimpanzees could also be to blame.\n\nIt can be transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids of people - and surfaces - that have been infected.", "description": "Doctors at Skane University Hospital in Lund said yesterday that while Ebola was unlikely, they could not rule out the lethal virus until test results came back.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline", "Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19444742-0-image-a-19_1570542382037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
