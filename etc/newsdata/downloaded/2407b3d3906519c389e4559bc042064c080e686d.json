Photo: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, former Trump adviser and probable New Hampshire Senate candidate Corey Lewandowski testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Congressional Democrats had called him in to ask him about obstruction of justice charges laid out in the Mueller report; Trump is alleged to have directed Lewandowski, who has never formally worked in the White House, to tell then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his decision to recuse himself and to limit the investigation to Russian electoral interference. But Lewandowski, who has always been one of the more belligerent inhabitants of the Trump universe, was predictably uninterested in cooperating. The hearing very quickly devolved into a circus, one that, judging by his Twitter feed, President Trump enjoyed wholeheartedly. (Later, things settled down to the point that Lewandowski actually provided some useful information about his role in the Mueller investigation.)\n\nHere are some of the lowlights:\n\nLewandowski describes Democrats as \u201cTrump haters\u201d in opening statement\n\nLewandowski began by reading a passage that heaped scorn on the Democrats investigating his conduct, portraying them as partisan witch-hunters. An excerpt: \u201cSadly, the country spent over three years and 40 million taxpayer dollars on these investigations. It is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2014 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Corey Lewandowski's full opening statement\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a nation would be better served if elected officials like you concentrated your efforts to combat the true crises facing our country as opposed to going down rabbit holes like this hearing.\u201d pic.twitter.com/g2AQjghb2C \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) September 17, 2019\n\nGiven that the speech sounded like it could have been written by Trump, it was no surprise that the president himself gave it his stamp of approval.\n\nSuch a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey! @CLewandowski_ \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2019\n\nLewandowski repeats the same absurd line justifying his non-responses\n\nAsked basic questions about his dealings with the White House by House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, Lewandowski repeated a variation of the same line \u2014 \u201cThe White House has directed me not to disclose any discussions with the president\u201d \u2014 again and again.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler: \"How many times has the president asked you to meet him in the White House?\"\n\n\n\nCorey Lewandowski: \"The White House has directed me not to disclose the subject of any discussions\" https://t.co/qpj8u58j3Z pic.twitter.com/553KAL2HDv \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 17, 2019\n\nThe idea that the White House has the legal power to direct a witness not to testify about such matters \u2014 especially one who never actually worked in the administration \u2014 is farcical. But Democrats, who did not seem eager to hold Lewandowski in contempt, and seemed strangely unprepared for the confrontational nature of their witness\u2019s testimony, simply moved on.\n\nLewandowski unsubtly stalls for time\n\nDuring the early stages of his testimony, Lewandowski brazenly feigned ignorance and unpreparedness to run out the clock on Democrats\u2019 questioning. The New York Times\u2019 recap of the hearing summed up the absurdity of this approach nicely:\n\nWhen Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the committee\u2019s chairman, asked Mr. Lewandowski if it was correct, as stated in the Mueller report, that he had met alone with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in the summer of 2017, Mr. Lewandowski balked. \u201cCould you repeat the exact language of the report, sir?\u201d he said. \u201cCongressman, I would like you to refresh my memory of the report so I could read along,\u201d he said, noting that he had not brought along a copy of the more than 400-page document. An exasperated Mr. Nadler had staff give Mr. Lewandowski a print copy of the report. \u201cMr. Chairman, where on page 90 is it?\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cDo you not have an independent recollection?\u201d Mr. Nadler shot back. Eventually, Mr. Lewandowski confirmed that he had been in the Oval Office, but Mr. Nadler\u2019s time ran out without any meaningful fact-finding. Republicans soon picked up where the witness left off, berating the Democrats for what they said was an unfair process.\n\n\n\nRepublicans help Lewandowski stall for time some more\n\nGOP representative Doug Collins, who told some notable lies during Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony in July, was at it again on Tuesday. Besides going off rather awkwardly about the ridiculousness of the hearing itself, he helped Lewandowski gum up the procedural works. At one point, he called a point of order on Nadler, asserting that the speaker had gone over his five-minute speaking-time limit. When Nadler attempted to overrule him via a voice vote \u2014 the results of which were obvious thanks to the Democratic majority on the committee \u2014 Collins asked for an official roll call, intentionally delaying the proceedings.\n\nThe greatest roll call vote in the history of the House.\n\n\n\nBrought to you by Doug Collins, featuring Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\n\nJerry Nadler looks completely unprepared for this ridiculous hearing. pic.twitter.com/sZ3rksoonJ \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) September 17, 2019\n\nLewandowski tells a congresswoman to read out loud for him\n\nQuestioned by Texas representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Lewandowski informed her that the text she was asking him about was not illustrated on the screen behind her, acting as though its non-appearance was impediment enough for him to dismiss her query altogether. After Jackson Lee dutifully called up the correct passage for him, Jackson Lee instructed Lewandowski to read off the screen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to read it, Congresswoman,\u201d Lewandowski replied.\n\nLewandowski gets a rhetorical alley-oop from a fellow Trump acolyte\n\nAfter a break in the mid-afternoon, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz \u2014 otherwise known as the congressman who threatened Michael Cohen on Twitter \u2014 was first-up to ask the former Trump campaign manager questions. Rather than do that, Gaetz wanted to speculate on the motives for Democratic lawmakers\u2019 lines of questioning, something he cannot do under House rules. So he threw a lob to Lewandowski, who said: \u201cI think they hate this president more than they love this country.\u201d\n\nLewandowski calls Eric Swallwell \u201cPresident Swallwell\u201d\n\nA notoriously sore winner, Lewandowski hit the former 2020 hopeful and California rep. with a not-so-subtle reminder that he was the first candidate to drop out of the Democratic primary.\n\nBringing the kids into it\n\nLewandowski harshly reproaches Rep. Raskin for calling the tooth fairy imaginary in front of his children, who he says are watching on television. That's where we are. \u2014 southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) September 17, 2019\n\nCould a pardon be involved?\n\nWhen asked if President Trump had ever dangled a pardon before him, Lewandowski demurred, \u201cciting privilege\u201d according to MSNBC\u2019s Kyle Griffin.\n\nWhat did Democrats expect?\n\nSurely Democrats on the House Judiciary were prepared for such a cantankerous witness: In an April 2018 appearance before the House Intelligence Committee in regarding the chamber\u2019s probe into Russian interference, Lewandowski was actually more hostile, informing lawmakers that he wasn\u2019t going to answer their \u201cfucking\u201d questions. But as CNN legal analyst Renato Mariotti notes, there could be a long-game reason for Judiciary Committee Dems to submit themselves to such abuse:\n\nPerhaps they were trying to build an obstruction of Congress case, which was Article III of the Nixon articles of impeachment.\n\n\n\nLewandowski is providing evidence of that today. https://t.co/dr7gtvj3m0 \u2014 Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) September 17, 2019", "description": "On Tuesday afternoon, former Trump adviser and probable New Hampshire Senate candidate Corey Lewandowski testified before the House Judiciary Committee.
