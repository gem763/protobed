But he said there 'can be no certainty' one will be made.\n\nCapital has seen its share value cut almost in half over the past four years, although shares have been on the rise in recent weeks on the back of the takeover interest.", "description": "Candy, 46, confirmed he is leading a consortium of interested bidders who are pondering a 'possible cash offer' for the developer, which owns Earls Court and Covent Garden in London.", "authors": ["City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
