Few details are known about the increased testing, including why it is being done or whether it would apply to unaccompanied children and asylum seekers.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security officials said the Department of Justice was behind the new plans.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Officials have since said the numbers had dropped down after crackdowns, changes to asylum rules and agreements with Central American countries, but border officers and agents have voiced concern over the potential for criminals to cross while resources are stretched.\n\nDNA testing is done mostly through a cheek swab to collect saliva, or using a strand of hair. The proposed new scans would create an enormous trove of biometrics data, raising privacy concerns and questions about whether people should be compelled to hand over their genetic fingerprint.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

People\u2019s DNA also contains identifying information on their families.\n\nA top Border Patrol official recently warned that expanding DNA collection at the border could make processing migrants in an orderly fashion more difficult.\n\nBrian Hastings, chief of the Border Patrol\u2019s law enforcement directorate, told a judge that his agents were currently not trained in the relevant collection, handling or health and safety precautions involving DNA.\n\nCurrently, people who cross the border illegally are made to give their fingerprints, which are sent to federal databases accessible by state and local law enforcement agencies. DNA can be taken if a person has been arrested on federal charges \u2013 and crossing the border between ports of entry is considered a federal crime.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies can submit samples to the FBI from suspects who are arrested or convicted of state or federal crimes and non-US citizens who are being detained by the government. The FBI\u2019s national DNA index contained over 17 million profiles from arrestees and other offenders, as of August.\n\nSome police departments collect samples from people who are never arrested or convicted of crimes, without a warrant, though the person is supposed to voluntarily provide a sample in those cases and not be coerced or threatened. State and federal authorities typically require a conviction or an arrest before a sample is taken.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s not a requirement, and Homeland Security has not vastly collected DNA samples.\n\nIn 2010, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano directed that people held on administrative proceedings \u2013 not detained on criminal charges \u2013 and those facing deportation proceedings would not have DNA collected.\n\nBroader sampling \u201cwould severely strain the resources of the agency to perform its broader mission,\u201d Napolitano wrote in a letter to then-Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe new regulations would install new protocols.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Donald Trump\u2018s administration is planning to expand the collection of DNA from migrants who cross into the US, and to store the data\u00a0in a huge criminal database run by the FBI.", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/23/trump-border-fence.jpg"}
