See What's Going On In India!\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Punit Paranjpe /AFP/Getty Images Punit Paranjpe /AFP/Getty Images\n\nImagine this \u2014 you're going to school, and you hear that the government has banned homework. Wouldn't that be the best day ever?\n\nWell, it actually happened in India. The government said there would be no homework for students in grades one and two. The reason: heavy school bags.\n\nLast November, the government announced new rules limiting the weight of school bags depending on a child's age.\n\nStudents of grades one and two would be allowed to carry bags weighing only at most about 3 pounds. For pupils studying in grades three and four, the weight limit was 6.6 pounds. There are limits set up through grade 10, where the cap is 11 pounds.\n\nThe rules also set limits on homework so little kids won't have to carry extra books home. (They almost always carry textbooks home because schools rarely provide lockers.)\n\nBut not every parent is convinced that the rules are working.\n\nOne afternoon in Mumbai, at the end of the school day, Swati Patil is waiting outside the building.\n\nPatil is a parent \u2014 and a backpack activist. She pulls out a scale from her bag and places it on the ground. She's here to weigh kids' backpacks. Her first candidate is a shy seventh-grader wearing a red hairband. Patil asks the girl to step on the scale, first without her backpack. She weighs 31 kilos (about 68 pounds). But with her backpack ... she's at 37 kilos.\n\nThat means her backpack weighs 6 kilos \u2013 about 13 pounds. That's a violation of the rules passed by the Indian government.\n\nIt's not the only heavy backpack in school circles.\n\nVishnu Kumar Chheda, a fifth-grader who studies in Mumbai, feels very tired when he comes home from school every day.\n\n\"I'm not able to go outside to play cricket with my friends,\" he says. \"My back hurts a lot.\"\n\nHis backpack weighs 22 pounds.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says the weight of bags shouldn't be more than 10 to 20 percent of the child's weight. But a 2016 survey by an Indian trade association showed that 88 percent of 7-to-13-year-olds were carrying backpacks nearly half their body weight.\n\nStudies have shown that carrying excessive loads can cause musculoskeletal disorders in kids.\n\nDr. Shreedhar Archik, an orthopedic surgeon in Mumbai, says putting a heavy load on a child's growing skeleton can alter posture.\n\n\"Sometimes these children develop a posture which can take two years to correct. We have to give them exercise to correct posture,\" says Archik.\n\nIndian lawmakers have been discussing the backpack burden for the past 30 years. In a parliamentary speech in 1989, novelist and lawmaker R.K. Narayan called for abolishing heavy school bags. He described how children \"develop a stoop and hang their arms forward like a chimpanzee while walking.\"\n\nAs Patil has found in her spot checks, the new rules aren't always enforced.\n\n\"Imagine an inspector catching a class 3 student's bag weighing more than 2.3 kg [about 5 pounds]. The headmistress will perhaps empty the child's water bottle or throw the lunchbox out to bring the bag within the prescribed limit,\" Krishna Kumar, former director of the National Council of Educational Research and Training, wrote in an op-ed piece.\n\nThe government's decisions are not implemented, Kumar states in an email to NPR. There's a \"gap between central and state [government] policies,\" he adds.\n\nPatil says she has interviewed school principals and parents who weren't even aware of the rules.\n\n\"The rules are just on paper,\" she says.\n\nA Mumbai-based homemaker and social activist, Patil started a campaign against heavy school bags a few years ago when she found out that her skinny sixth-grade son was carrying 15 pounds on his back.\n\n\"As a mother, I was really worried,\" Patil says.\n\nIn 2015, she filed a petition in a Mumbai court demanding that the government take action to reduce the weight of backpacks. The court ordered authorities in the state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, to take necessary steps. But based on random checks of backpack weights, Patil believes that backpacks are still too heavy. She plans to file a fresh petition in India's Supreme Court in September.\n\nThe burden of heavy backpacks is driven, in part, by publishers, says Francis Joseph, head of School Leader Network Foundation, a Mumbai-based education nonprofit.\n\nPublishers flood the market with exam guide books that promise top marks.\n\n\"Now they have books with additional material, additional worksheets. For them, the more they publish, the more the price shoots up,\" says Joseph. \"They forget that this is all adding on to the weight.\"\n\nAlso, most of the content is in the form of physical books. Joseph says e-learning has still not become an integral part of Indian schools.\n\nNine-year-old Chheda, who used to live in Columbus, Ohio, before he moved to Mumbai this year, says back in the United States at least some of his study material was on an iPad. So his backpack used to be much lighter than the 22 pounds he now carries. But at his posh private school in Mumbai, \"we have textbooks, a lot, a lot of textbooks,\" he says.\n\nThat could be changing. The Indian government has announced several new initiatives to boost digital learning, including 900,000 digital blackboards in schools across the country. Some state governments have also looked into replacing textbooks with tablets or Amazon Kindles. The online education market in India is expected to be worth nearly $2 billion by 2021.\n\nIn the future, when digital learning becomes mainstream, maybe the burden on kids' backs will be reduced. But some Indian educators don't want to wait that long. They've come up with creative, low-tech solutions. Like cutting up textbooks into monthly chapters so that students carry only the material they're going to need that month.\n\nOr how about a pickup and drop-off service for backpacks?A few years ago, a school in the southern Indian state of Kerala started sending a van to students' homes to collect their bags. For those fortunate youngsters, walking to school is no longer a pain in the back.", "description": "India has made new rules regulating the weight of school bags.
