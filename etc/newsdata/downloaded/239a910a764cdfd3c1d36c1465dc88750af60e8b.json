About 100,000 others in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island also had no electricity.\n\nThough no longer a hurricane, the storm is still packing cyclone-strength winds reaching about 130 kph (81 mph), the Canadian Hurricane Center said.\n\n\u201cDorian will slowly weaken as it moves northeastward across northern Newfoundland later today and east of Labrador tonight,\u201d the center said overnight.\n\nThe defense ministry said it would send up to 700 troops to help in the clean-up, and Nova Scotians have been asked to stay off the roads so that crews can safely remove trees and debris to restore power.\n\n\u201cThere is extensive damage,\u201d Karen Hutt, chief executive office of Nova Scotia Power Inc, said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cThis storm was intense\u201d and it will be \u201cdays not hours\u201d before power is restored to everyone.\n\nThe storm blew over a large construction crane in downtown Halifax, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia, on Saturday. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\nDorian ripped into the Bahamas a week ago with Category 5 winds and some gusts topping 320 kph (200 mph), leaving a trail of destruction and death, with 43 confirmed dead and the number expected to rise.", "description": "Canada's government authorized hundreds of troops on Sunday to help clear trees after Storm Dorian tore through the Atlantic coast overnight, leaving almost half a million people in three provinces without power.", "authors": ["John Morris", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427631551&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870OO-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
