That means summer dates often first become available in winter. At popular Idaho campgrounds like those at Redfish Lake, it\u2019s impossible to know how many hopeful campers are vying for the sites on Recreation.gov.\n\nWhile a select few campers will succeed, others will scramble to add sites and dates to their online shopping carts, only to be met with a message declaring that all of the sites already have sold out within seconds, the Idaho Statesman reports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve quit trying to make reservations at Redfish,\u201d Roxann Jensen wrote on a Statesman Facebook prompt about booking campsites. \u201cI gave up after experiencing \u2018no spaces available\u2019 year after year after year. I\u2019m totally disgusted with this.\u201d\n\nJanelle Smith knows the frustration. Even she hasn\u2019t been able to snag a spot at Redfish, and as a spokeswoman for Recreation.gov, she\u2019s no stranger to the website\u2019s reservation system.\n\n\u201cWhen you can\u2019t get a site for years running and it sells out in minutes, we get that that\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Smith, who is based in Boise.\n\nTheories abound on why those campgrounds book up in the blink of an eye. Smith and other experts said they can\u2019t know for sure why one camper gets a spot over another, but the answer could be simple: Some campgrounds are just that in demand.\n\n___\n\nWHY IS IT SO HARD TO BOOK IDAHO CAMPSITES?\n\nOn a prompt in the Idaho Nature Lovers Facebook group, campers from across the site shared their experiences using Recreation.gov.\n\nPatsy Diann Secrist said she\u2019s heard of campers who book an entire week at a site starting on a Monday.\n\n\u201cThey go to the website 6 months in advance and reserve from the Monday before through the desired weekend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThen later on cancel the Monday through Thursday\u2026.weekend reserved.\u201d\n\nSome said they deliberately avoid popular spots because they\u2019re so crowded, while others said they\u2019ve simply given up. Still other commenters said they\u2019ve noticed the rush for sites like Bull Trout Lake, Redfish Lake or Deadwood Lookout but have managed to snag a reservation.\n\n\u201cHave been able to book campsites in the past \u2026 at Glacier View Campground at Redfish Lake but only at 1:00 a.m. 6 months in advance,\u201d wrote Shawn Murdock. (In most cases, Recreation.gov releases campsites at 8 a.m. Mountain Time six months ahead of the booking date.)\n\n\u201cOne of the problems is that it is a hot spot that everyone tries to go because it\u2019s the one place everyone talks about and it\u2019s the same place everyone returns year after year,\u201d Murdock said.\n\nJulie Thomas, spokeswoman for the Sawtooth National Forest where Redfish is located, said the forest is busier than ever this year.\n\n\u201cRedfish Lake is always a favorite,\u201d she said in a phone interview, adding that it often sells out for the entire summer.\n\nSome have pointed the finger at bots, saying the same technology that scoops up event tickets for marked-up resale is responsible for the hard-to-book campgrounds, though there\u2019s no evidence that the sites are being relisted and sold elsewhere.\n\n\u201cCertainly bots exist in any sort of reservation systems,\u201d Smith said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re out there. We use Captcha and developers monitor for bots and arrest those as best they can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re working on,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re implementing industry best practices.\u201d\n\nSmith said it\u2019s more likely that some users are just faster than others at snagging their ideal spot. It also could be another symptom of Idaho\u2019s recent population boom that\u2019s affecting everything from traffic to property taxes.\n\n___\n\n\u2018900 PEOPLE WANT 30 SITES\u2019\n\nTom Zadick is the regional recreation manager for Recreation Resource Management of America, which contracts with the Forest Service to manage campsites in Arizona, Colorado and Idaho. His team manages campgrounds in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, where Redfish Lake\u2019s popular Glacier View, Outlet and Point reservation campsites are.\n\nHe knows how difficult it can be to find an opening at one of the campgrounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the horror stories of entire families sitting in a room with a dozen computers, hitting refresh (on the website) trying to book something and maybe one person will get it,\u201d he said.\n\nZadick said the hard-to-book campsites are the result of \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of growing popularity, limited supply and the occasional person who abuses the system by reselling a site or overstaying their reservation.\n\n\u201cWe have more demand than supply,\u201d Zadick said in a phone interview. \u201cThe sites at Glacier View, Outlet and Point are some of the most requested in the United States. When 900 people want 30 sites, a lot of people are going to be turned away.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zadick, the popular campgrounds are world famous, drawing visitors from out of state and even as far as Europe and Asia, though he said about 50 percent of campers at Redfish are Idahoans. He compared the level of demand at Redfish to that at Lake Tahoe - except Tahoe has far more sites to accommodate that demand. And the traffic is spilling from Redfish Lake to the surrounding Sawtooth National Forest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing visitation numbers three times what they were a few years ago,\u201d Zadick said. \u201cCampsites that never used to fill up are full from Wednesday night through the weekends.\u201d\n\nAnd when that many people are vying for a few spots, things can get tense, especially at the handful of nearby walk-in campsites.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve literally had people almost in fistfights at Sockeye,\u201d Zadick said.\n\nHe said some guests are \u201cliterally trolling the (walk-in) campgrounds, and the second someone leaves, they jump in.\u201d Others sleep in their cars near walk-up campgrounds in hopes of securing a spot when another group leaves the next morning.\n\nZadick said his company is working with the Forest Service and Recreation.gov to find a solution for the overcrowding and competition. There\u2019s a chance all the campgrounds in the Redfish Lake area may become reservation sites. Other popular camping areas have adopted lottery systems for reservations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s various opinions around how we can correct (the issues),\u201d Zadick said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any easy solution.\u201d\n\nBefore any potential changes are made, they\u2019ll go through a public comment period.\n\n\u201cFrustrated comments don\u2019t do any good,\u201d Zadick said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not a perfect system. The public could help us help them. We\u2019re open to suggestions and constructive criticism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOW TO BOOK IDAHO CAMPSITES\n\nThere\u2019s no magic bullet for booking your ideal campground, but Smith and Boise National Forest spokeswoman Venetia Gempler offered a few tips that could make it easier to reserve a spot:\n\n? Come prepared: Smith advised doing a \u201cdry run\u201d of the Recreation.gov website so you\u2019re familiar with the steps for making a reservation. The site switched to a new vendor last October and was completely overhauled, so it may look or operate differently than the last time you used it.\n\nSmith also said it\u2019s helpful to know what site you\u2019re hoping to get and which dates you want to book.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of person who books my summer down to the day six months out, but certainly people do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBe ready to just book right away.\u201d\n\n? Be flexible: While most work schedules make weekend camping convenient, that also means weekends are the busiest. If you\u2019re willing to schedule a trip during the week, you may have better luck. In addition, Smith pointed out that popular holidays like the Fourth of July and Memorial Day weekend are also more difficult to book.\n\n? Have a backup plan: Keep in mind four or five sites that you\u2019d be alright with camping at so you can book there if your first choice falls through.\n\n\u201cWe only have so many sites,\u201d said Thomas, the Sawtooth National Forest spokeswoman. \u201cThe only advice we can give is \u2026 you might have to have some other options.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t get your preferred site, consider exploring. Dispersed camping is allowed on public land for campers who don\u2019t mind giving up amenities like toilets. There are also many campgrounds across the state that don\u2019t sell out, as well as walk-in campsites without reservations.\n\nSmith also pointed to Recreation.gov\u2019s trip building tool, which lets you choose a starting point and destination and see which campgrounds or experiences are available along the way.\n\nAnd if you just have to have that campsite on the shore of Redfish Lake, you could try using bots in your favor. Websites like Campnab will scrape Recreation.gov regularly and send you alerts if a date opens up (for a fee, of course), and similar browser extensions exist, too.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After years of trying and failing to book sites at Idaho's more popular campgrounds, some people have just given up.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nicole Blanchard"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
