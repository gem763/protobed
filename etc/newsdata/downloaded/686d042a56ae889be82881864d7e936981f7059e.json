They knew many would die. Some Green Berets there said they felt \"ashamed.\" US allies worried that if Trump (meaning the United States) can suddenly betray its friends without warning, they could be next.\n\nCNN reporter just back from Syria as Turkey moves in\n\nCNN reporter just back from Syria as Turkey moves in 01:49\n\nCNN reporter just back from Syria as Turkey moves in\n\nLate on Monday, Trump announced new economic sanctions against Turkey for its \"destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\" If nothing else, this is an acknowledgment that the removal of US troops was a grievous mistake. But that in no way excuses it; rather, it highlights how disastrously incoherent, chaotic and contradictory the policy is.\n\nTrump's Syria decision is so harmful, that it is imperative we find out what was behind it. What exactly did Trump and Erdogan say to each other on that phone call? Why did Trump agree to stand back and allow Erdogan's forces -- the Turkish army and Islamist militias -- to make their move?\n\nThese are compelling questions that demand an answer. Congress should require that Trump t urn over a complete transcript or recording of the call with Erdogan. In fact, we also need to find out what exactly Trump has discussed with Putin on this issue. The transcripts don't need to be released to the public. Maybe a joint committee of Congress or even a panel of judges can hear the evidence. But the steps and reasoning that led to this catastrophic self-inflicted wound on American security and standing in the world must be scrutinized.\n\nIf Trump refuses, we will know he has something to hide.\n\nAmerican presidents enjoy a great deal of latitude, particularly on foreign policy. Trump, like his predecessors, has a right to make the wrong strategic decisions. He has a right to make stupid mistakes. God knows previous US presidents have made them before. But presidents must make these decisions, even foolish ones, based on what they think is in the best interest of the United States.\n\nPhotos: Turkey launches military offensive in Syria People in Qamishli, Syria, attend a funeral Monday, October 14, for five fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces.

There is no reason to expect that America will gain absolutely anything from this costly policy reversal. It goes against every geopolitical objective of the Unites States. Trump's claim that this was a move to \"end endless wars,\" is baseless. This force was already a low-cost mechanism for ending endless wars, for preventing new ones and for keeping existing ones from getting worse.\n\nEven if he wanted to withdraw, why do it without preparation?\n\nTo be sure, President Obama made terrible mistakes in Syria , but this small force, built over the course of half a decade, achieved impressive results. The Syrian Kurds were a force multiplier. They did most of the fighting against ISIS , losing thousands of men and women warriors. (Yes, women are an integral part of the Kurdish forces that Turkey views as a terrorist organization.)\n\nThe chances of war between Iran and Israel are now greater . The strength of Russia is enhanced as its ally Assad recaptures more of Syria, and emerges more beholden to Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nAmerica has betrayed its friends before, but it was always in the face of a profound moral dilemma. A moral compromise to avoid something worse, or to gain something different. But there was no dilemma here.\n\nWhy did Trump do it?\n\nThe President already told us, before becoming president, that he had \" a little conflict of interest\" with Turkey, where he has substantial business concerns, including not one but two Trump towers. But maybe that has nothing to do with it. Maybe it was just arrogance, carelessness, hubris.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, we might shake our heads at Trump's decision; call it a horrible mistake and make the best of it. But these are not normal circumstances, and this is not just any poor tactical move.
