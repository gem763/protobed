I am simply less of a 'name' and less in demand than I was in 2008, which has negatively affected my income.\"\n\nFederline said he deserves more because he's \"less of a name\" than he was in 2008.

Her father is looking into ending the conservatorship, the magazine reported.\n\nBritney Spears with her niece, Lexi, and her sons, Sean and Jayden James, at the Teen Choice Awards in 2015 AP Images\n\nFederline said there is \"an extreme disparity between the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties' minor children in [Spears'] home and in [Federline's] home,\" according to The Blast.\n\n\"[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate [sp] villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course,\" Federline wrote in the court documents. \"In contrast, [Federline] lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with [Spears] and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.\"\n\nSpears has earned $100 million from her Las Vegas concert residency, according to Forbes. Getty Images\n\nThe document points out that Spears has private chefs, tutors, and other household staff available for her children, as well as \"toys\" including ATVs, video game systems, iPads, and laptops.\n\nFederline also alleged that while Spears takes their children on multiple vacations a year at luxury resorts, he cannot afford to take them on vacation.\n\nHe also claimed that he doesn't have space at his home to host 15 of their children's friends over for a sleepover.\n\nFederline and his wife, Victoria Prince, at an event in 2009 Getty Images\n\nBernard Post, a New York-based divorce attorney, told Yahoo that \"it's not unreasonable to argue that each parent should provide a comparable lifestyle, but it's not necessary to replicate that lifestyle verbatim.\"\n\nHe said the real question is how Federline uses the $20,000 he currently gets from Spears each month.\n\n\"It boggles the mind that he would ask for more money,\" Post told Yahoo.\n\nHe's apparently not the only one who thinks so.\n\nPeople on Twitter slammed K-Fed's request, saying that the current payments should be more than enough and that Spears shouldn't have to fund his \"fancy lifestyle.\"\n\nMany echoed the sentiment that Federline should get a \"real job.\"\n\nOthers said that Spears worked hard for her money and deserves to have whatever lifestyle she wants.\n\nThis Twitter user's simple message, however, may have said it best.\n\nEnough said.\n\nSign up hereto get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "description": "Britney Spears' ex-husband, 40-year-old DJ Kevin Federline, filed court documents asking Spears to hike his child support payment from $20,000 a month to $60,000.
