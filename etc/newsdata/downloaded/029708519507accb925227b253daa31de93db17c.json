A court appearance was scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nThe grand jury returned a special finding that Smith subjected the victim, 30-year-old Kathleen Henry, to 'substantial physical torture,' as well as sexual assault involving non-consensual 'hand to breast' and 'hand to vagina' contact.\n\nThe murder and assault charges stem from the suspect's actions alleged to have taken place on September 4, when Henry was strangled to death at TownePlace Suites by Marriott in Anchorage, while the evidence tampering charges are related to the suspect's actions on September 6.\n\nBrian Smith, 48 (left), has been indicted on eight counts for allegedly torturing, raping and killing Kathleen Jo Henry, 30 (right)\n\nSmith, 48, was arrested on October 8 after police linked him to a memory card found on the street that was labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott'. The SD card allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling a woman in a hotel room at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott (pictured) in Anchorage\n\nAccording to the indictment obtained by KTVA, Smith 'destroyed, mutilated, altered, suppressed, concealed, or removed physical evidence with intent to impair its verity or availability in an official proceeding or criminal investigation.'\n\nFBI Special Agent Steve Forrest said the agency is helping investigate the death of Henry, whose remains were discovered October 2 by a passerby along the highway south of Anchorage.\n\n'I can\u2019t discuss details of the case but can confirm the FBI has provided and continues to provide investigative and technical assistance to the Anchorage Police Department,' Forrest said by email.\n\nAuthorities have not said whether they believe there could be additional victims linked to Smith, but the prosecution's motion seeking to have 19 search warrants sealed raised the prospect that the investigation could extend to 'other jurisdictions,' reported Anchorage Daily News.\n\nA woman called police on September 30 and said she had found a camera memory card on the ground containing evidence of a crime.\n\nThe card was labeled, 'Homicide at midtown Marriott.' Midtown is a section of Anchorage.\n\nBissland, 69, said Smith has never been violent and she does not believe the allegations\n\nThe wife revealed that the South African native became a naturalized US citizen on September 20 - just over two weeks after the murder\n\nDetectives reviewed the card and found 39 photos and 12 videos. The videos showed a man beating and strangling a woman, telling her to 'Just...die' and laughing.\n\nThe woman attacked had dark hair and was described as 'possibly Alaskan Native.'\n\nThe man's voice in the video had what sounded like an English accent. Detectives listening to the video remembered the voice from a previous investigation and linked it to Smith, an immigrant from South Africa.\n\nInvestigators learned that Smith from September 2-4 had stayed at TownePlace Suites by Marriott. Photos on the memory card showed a partial license plate on a black pickup, and detectives linked it to a 1999 Ford Ranger registered to Smith and his wife.\n\nCellphone records placed Smith in the area where Henry\u2019s body was found shortly after the last photo was taken.\n\nAnchorage police have declined to comment on a previous investigation involving Smith.\n\nPolice on October 10 identified the woman killed as Henry, who was originally from Eek, a village 420 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nPolice believe human remains found on a highway about 20 miles south of Anchorage on October 2 belonged to the woman who was murdered in the hotel room. Investigators are pictured at the scene where the remains were discovered\n\nBefore her death, Henry (pictured)was taking strong steps towards creating a new life and received her GED in 2012\n\nPolice arrested Smith on October 8 at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport as he returned from a trip.\n\nPolice credit the woman who turned in the memory card for Smith\u2019s timely arrest.\n\nAn affidavit described in gruesome detail how the videos showed the victim being beaten on a hotel room floor as she attempted to fight back.\n\nThe footage showed the woman with long dark hair being strangled as her assailant stomped on her throat.\n\nHenry (pictured) said on her Facebook post: 'I will be seated inside a jet plane without looking back and just focus on a new lifetime'\n\nHours later the videos showed the suspect carrying her body through the hotel parking lot in a white sheet and placing it in a pickup truck that matched one Smith shares with his wife.\n\nThe dozens of photos showed Henry lying naked on the hotel carpet with a bruised left eye, bloodied blue lips and red marks on her face.\n\nSmith's wife of five years, 69-year-old Stephanie Bissland, spoke to KTUU after his arrest and voiced her support for him, saying that he was 'a good husband' and that he has never exhibited any violent tendencies.\n\nBissland told the station she learned of her husband's arrest when two detectives from the Anchorage Police Department tracked her down in Virginia, where she was visiting family this week.\n\nThe woman said she was shocked by the allegations against her husband, who had just become a naturalized citizen on September 20, just over two weeks after Henry's murder.\n\n'Never in my life would I have thought what they are saying is going on... I don't believe it,' the wife said.\n\nBissland added: 'I'll stand behind him, beside him, while he's going through this.'\n\nAccording to her Facebook account, Henry was an indigenous Alaska Native who was working to get her life on track and was taking the proper steps to get there.\n\nShe reportedly received her GED in October 2012 while at the Highland Mountain Correctional Center and shared her compassionate, care free spirit with the world.\n\nOn August 26, she said: 'I will be seated inside a jet plane without looking back and just focus on a new lifetime.'\n\nShe said in 2018 that was avoiding negativity.\n\n'A lot has been on my mind and I know for sure everything and anything will be far from negativity because I can make a choice to do so,' she said.\n\n'Take it easy and enjoy life.'\n\nHenry celebrated getting her GED on Facebook, two days before she was last heard from on social media\n\nHenry shared her vision for 'a new lifetime' with friends and loved ones on her Facebook page (pictured)\n\nHenry expressed wanting to 'get [her] life straight and act together' in the days leading up to her sudden death\n\nHenry also said: 'I live daily with a whole lot of soft hearted not HATRED feelings unless someone treats me with disrespect then I\u2019ll treat you the same amount of disrespect. Treat others the way you want to be treated.'\n\nFriends and family have taken to her social media account to mourn the loss of their loved one.\n\nOne woman wrote: 'Rest with JESUS Kathleen .. I SCREAM FOR JUSTICE/ LIFE IN IMPRISONMENT.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Praying God's peace for you and strength for your family during this difficult time.'\n\n'I pray that your family finds peace,' one person said.\n\n'Such a sad story and situation to read about. Hate that people can be so cruel and evil. Rest on sweetheart.'\n\nKendra Kloster, Executive Director of Native Peoples Actions, called Henry's death 'heartbreaking.\n\nKloster told KTVA-TV: 'We're just really tired of hearing all the violence that's going on against indigenous women. It's heartbreaking, it's traumatic for our communities and this is why this is one of the top issues for us.'\n\nPolice believe Smith (pictured with his wife in 2014) took all of the crime scene photos and videos himself. It is unclear whether he knew the victim beforehand\n\nRecords available through the Anchorage Court System's website paint a picture of a turbulent life marred by multiple convictions and jail stints.\n\nHenry's arrest record stretches back to at least 2007 and includes a litany of charges, including multiple counts of assault, disorderly conduct, reckless driving, criminal trespass, resisting arrest, vehicle theft, DUI, theft and vehicle trespassing, among others.\n\nHer most recent run-in with the law took place in January 2019, when Henry was picked up for assault. She pleaded guilty in that case in June.\n\nIt is unknown at this time where and how Henry first came in contact with Smith.\n\nPolice are still working to determine whether the woman knew Smith and how she ended up in the hotel room.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Smith was born in Queenstown, South Africa, and has been married to an Alaska native since 2014.\n\nPolice did not disclose the nature of the previous investigation that led them to recognize Smith's accent in the memory card images.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, police thanked the Anchorage woman who turned in the memory card and said the discovery was 'instrumental' in Smith's arrest.\n\n'Had the citizen not called us after she found the video card, we would not have been able to solve this crime as quickly as we did,' Anchorage Police Department spokesman MJ Thim told KTVA.\n\nThim said investigators initially questioned whether the crimes recorded on the SD card had been staged.\n\n'We quickly ruled that out,' he said, 'and then started to piece together from the video, from the visual aspects for the images, and also the audio, we were able to quickly determine where this took place and we were starting to put together the timeline.'", "description": "A grand jury in Alaska on Monday handed up an indictment charging Brian Smith with eight felony counts of murder, sexual assault and evidence tampering in the killing of Kathleen Henry.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19793156-0-image-a-13_1571241672174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
