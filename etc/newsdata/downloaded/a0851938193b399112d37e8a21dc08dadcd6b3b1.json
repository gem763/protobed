When asked if that indicated the president was lying about that claim, McConnell said \u201cyou\u2019ll have to ask him. I don\u2019t recall any conversations with the president about that phone call.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on the South Lawn on Oct. 3, Trump said that he and McConnell had spoken directly about the phone call, according to the official White House transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cHe put out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read. And I spoke to him about it, too,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018That was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read.\u2019 I mean, give me a break. Anybody that reads it says the same thing,\u201d Trump added.\n\nMcConnell had previously urged the White House to release the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, according to two internal sources cited by The Washington Post.\n\nThe call summary released by the White House was the catalyst for an impeachment inquiry looking at whether Trump withheld nearly $400 million in foreign aid to Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials investigated his potential 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. It is illegal to solicit foreign involvement in U.S. elections, and investigations have yielded no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.", "description": "The president said the Senate majority leader spoke with him and called it \"the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf7164200000881c5067bd.jpeg?cache=zpkkjgiczh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
