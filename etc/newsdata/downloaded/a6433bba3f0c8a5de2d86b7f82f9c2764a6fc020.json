Senators in both parties say they are optimistic the package will pass. The House, by comparison, has passed 10.\n\nRepublicans are hoping that this week\u2019s votes could help end the logjam over funding the government.\n\n\u201cHopefully the Democrats will play ball and we can actually get the appropriations process moving,\u201d said Sen.

Cole said he would personally support addressing the noncontroversial bills, \u201cbut count me as skeptical that either side is going to let bargaining chips go until we reach a larger settlement.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats fumed after Republicans forced 302(b) allocations through committee that they argued provided additional funds for the Department of Homeland Security bill.\n\nThey\u2019ve also balked over supporting the Senate panel\u2019s defense bill after Republicans rejected an amendment that would have restricted the president\u2019s ability to redirect military funding toward the border wall without congressional approval.\n\nThe disagreement will come to a head as soon as this week. McConnell has teed up a second spending package, which will include the defense bill, for consideration after the domestic spending package.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTurkey says soldier killed despite cease-fire in Syria Schumer calls for FDA to probe reports of contaminated baby food How Trump and Pelosi went from bad to worse MORE (D-N.Y.) has pledged that Democrats will keep the Pentagon spending bill from getting the 60 votes needed to advance. In addition to the defense bill, Schumer says the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services and military construction bills are all currently stuck in limbo.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans are willing to engage with us on the 302(b)s, we get negotiations back on track for funding the government,\u201d he said.\n\nShelby acknowledged the standstill over the defense bill. He also wouldn\u2019t commit to releasing the text of the military construction and veterans affairs bill, which is considered controversial because it is expected to backfill $3.6 billion in funding previously directed toward the wall as part of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nBut he noted that McConnell is open to moving another package of noncontroversial bills if senators are able to make progress this week. In addition to the package being voted on this week, four other bills also passed the committee with bipartisan support, making them ripe for floor consideration.\n\nLawmakers have 22 legislative days between now and the deadline to reach a deal, but the impeachment inquiry shadowing everything that Congress does won\u2019t make matters easy.\n\n\u201cIt will impact and shape everything, at least through that vote, if not after,\u201d said Cole.\n\nSome believe the battle between Democrats and Trump will poison any chance of a deal on spending bills.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be any appropriations bills.
