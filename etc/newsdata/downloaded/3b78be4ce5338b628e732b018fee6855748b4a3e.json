Ilhan Omar\u2019s and Rashida Tlaib\u2019s canceled trip to Israel has died down. Yet the uncomfortable problem raised by the episode still lingers, and leading Democrats are loath to confront it \u2014 namely: the inexorable drift of one of America\u2019s two major parties toward anti-Israelism and, often, outright anti-Semitism.\n\nDemocrats like to focus their frustrations on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and they did so this time, as well. Yet Tlaib and Omar targeted Israel itself.\n\nIt is a standard progressive talking point that criticizing the government of Israel isn\u2019t the same as anti-Semitism, criticizing Israel writ large or questioning its right to exist. But this is precisely where Tlaib, Omar and other far-left Democrats are changing the debate. When Omar uses air quotes while calling Israel a democracy, and Tlaib compares it to apartheid South Africa, they are questioning the very legitimacy of the Jewish state.\n\nsee also Dems are heading for a complete split with Israel Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar are forcing fellow Democrats...\n\nWhile Democrats point the finger at Netanyahu for making Israel a partisan issue, they should be taking stock of their own rhetoric and conduct. The constant condemnations of Israel from within their own caucus, with nary a mention of Palestinian terrorism, marks a new moment in Democratic politics.\n\nFact is, there is no possible Israeli government that would appease those on the Democratic hard-left and the base who are convinced that Israel is an evil nation.\n\nWhat would have happened had Bibi let the congresswomen in?\n\nAs Tlaib and Omar made clear at their recent news conference, their intention all along was to expose Israel\u2019s alleged wrongdoings. Tlaib was prepared to travel to Israel with MIFTAH, a group that has published Jewish blood libels and propaganda questioning the Holocaust.\n\nMainstream Democrats\u2019 tacit acceptance of hateful rhetoric, and their refusal to call out Omar\u2019s and Tlaib\u2019s calls to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel, should trouble all Americans who value Israel as a safe haven for Jews and a strategic ally.\n\nThese are the same Democrats who rail against Republicans for failing to call out Trump\u2019s allegedly racist rhetoric. But when their own members paint Israel as a cruel oppressor rather than a vulnerable nation threatened by an entire region dedicated to its destruction, they go silent. Somehow a handful of progressive congresswomen have instilled fear in the Democratic leadership on this and many other issues. This is shocking.\n\nThus far, Israel and the Middle East have not been major issues in the 2020 Democratic Primary. That has to change. With the progressive zeitgeist in America moving so strongly and swiftly against Israel, the American people need to know where these candidates stand on the issue.\n\nIt will not be enough to simply say that there are divergent opinions in the Democratic caucus; men and women who wish to be president must decisively back the right of Israel to defend itself and vociferously oppose any efforts to punish Israel economically.\n\nThey cannot in good faith criticize Israel for barring entry to politicians intent on deriding that nation, while tolerating the view that the United States should be actively punishing that nation, and placing it at risk.\n\nIdeas about Israel and Jews were once well outside the mainstream of both parties but are now spreading like a dark shadow over the Democrats. Fewer than 20 years ago, then-President Democrat Bill Clinton said that if Israel were attacked he would \u201cpersonally grab a rifle; get in a ditch, and fight and die.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Democratic leaders don\u2019t even have the courage to fire off a press release defending Israel.\n\nThe question facing the Democratic Party isn\u2019t Netanyahu or this or that Israeli government or this or that Mideast development. The question facing Democrats is whether they will confront members of their own party whose disdain for Israel is worn like a badge of honor.\n\nThe question is whether Democrats will stand for democracy or theocracy, for freedom or the tyranny that besets the rest of the region.\n\nIf the Democrats bend the knee to these apologists for terrorist organizations just because they don\u2019t like Bibi or Trump, they will be playing a dangerous game. They must make clear, now, that they stand with Israel and the Israeli people in their quest for peace and security.\n\nDavid Marcus is The Federalist\u2019s New York correspondent.
