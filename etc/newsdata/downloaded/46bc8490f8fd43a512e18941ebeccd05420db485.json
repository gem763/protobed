They try to anticipate what will happen, to put themselves on the \u201cright side of history\u201d.\u2019\n\nWell, now Mr Johnson himself has rolled the dice. It\u2019s easy to see why he did it, of course. Nobody will mourn the end of this Zombie Parliament, full of MPs who were only too happy to tell us what they were against, but never what they were in favour of.\n\nWe need a government that can govern, and we badly need an end to Brexit. Even so: what a gamble! If things go wrong, we could wake up with Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister, John McDonnell running Britain\u2019s finances, Diane Abbott in charge of the police and security services, and Emily Thornberry representing this country abroad \u2014 the ultimate Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nOn paper, you can see why Mr Johnson was so keen to go for it. Most polls give the Conservatives a double-digit lead, while his personal lead over Jeremy Corbyn is more than 20 per cent.\n\nHaving shown commendable decisiveness since becoming PM, Mr Johnson has a clear plan for leaving the EU with a deal, whereas Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy is almost laughably vague.\n\nOn paper, you can see why Mr Johnson was so keen to go for it. Most polls give the Conservatives a double-digit lead, while his personal lead over Jeremy Corbyn is more than 20 per cent\n\nSo it is easy to see how events might play into Mr Johnson\u2019s hands.\n\nThe Remain vote splinters between Labour and the Lib Dems. Floating voters are repelled by Mr Corbyn\u2019s weakness and extremism. The Brexit Party\u2019s supporters drift back to the Tories. And at the end of it all, the Prime Minister strolls back into No 10 with a handsome majority. Job done.\n\nThis, at any rate, is the future according to Mr Johnson\u2019s pocket Machiavelli, Dominic Cummings, who masterminded the Leave campaign in 2016.\n\nIn Mr Cummings\u2019s scenario, dozens of working-class Leave constituencies will turn Tory for the first time in living memory, more than compensating for any losses to the Lib Dems.\n\nBut in politics, as in life, things rarely work out as planned. And for all the talk of Mr Cummings\u2019s strategic genius, I can\u2019t help noticing that many of his wheezes have proved to be total disasters.\n\nWe need a government that can govern, and we badly need an end to Brexit. Even so: what a gamble! If things go wrong, we could wake up with Jeremy Corbyn (pictured left) as Prime Minister, John McDonnell running Britain\u2019s finances, Diane Abbott (pictured right) in charge of the police and security services, and Emily Thornberry representing this country abroad \u2014 the ultimate Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nThe prorogation of Parliament, for example, was supposedly a tactical masterstroke that would prove Mr Johnson\u2019s mettle as a ruthless Prime Minister. In reality, though, it was a constitutional shambles, uniting Remainers in opposition before it was ignominiously struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd although I am delighted to see the back of this preening, pointless Parliament, there is a risk that Mr Johnson\u2019s gamble might turn out to be a terrible own goal.\n\nWe have, after all, a very recent precedent for an invulnerable PM calling an early election with a commanding lead, looking forward to Hoovering up Leave voters, and then watching in horror as the whole thing exploded in her face.\n\nBoris Johnson is very different from Theresa May, of course. As a tried and tested TV performer, accustomed to the spotlight after years as Mayor of London, he is a much better campaigner. (Indeed, he could hardly be worse.)\n\nBut I can\u2019t help noticing that the opinion polls give him a smaller share of the vote than the 42 per cent Mrs May won in the actual election two-and-a-half years ago. Can he really be so certain he will succeed where she failed?\n\nI struggle to think of any recent election that has been shrouded in such agonising uncertainty. Will Mr Johnson win support for his decisiveness, or lose them for his rackety private life?\n\nWill Remainers rally to Jeremy Corbyn? Will it be a second referendum in all but name? And which will matter more: austerity or allegations of anti-Semitism? The answer, if we are being honest, is that nobody knows. This is what makes the election impossible to call.\n\nDoes history offer any guide?\n\nWomen at a polling station in Thornton Heath, London, during the General Election, 6th December 1923\n\nOne worrying lesson for the Prime Minister is that the British people usually resent being dragged to the polling stations, and rarely reward the politicians responsible. Mrs May learned that the hard way in 2017.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that even though winter elections make little difference to turnout \u2014 1923 and 1974, for example \u2014 many people are very unhappy at the thought of a general election just before Christmas.\n\nIndeed, for most sane people, the prospect of popping into Santa\u2019s Grotto and finding, say, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Emily Thornberry or Anna Soubry lurking behind the beard is simply too ghastly to contemplate.\n\nThe \u2018coupon\u2019 election of December 14, 1918, was held after the end of World War I. The Tories agreed a pact with David Lloyd George\u2019s Coalition Liberals, with approved candidates brandishing a letter of endorsement, or \u2018coupon\u2019. The coupon parties won a landslide, with more than 50 per cent of the vote and 509 seats between them.\n\nCould today\u2019s Tories strike a similar arrangement with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party? It seems very unlikely, since Mr Farage has already made clear his contempt for Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nAnd even if the two parties quietly agreed local arrangements, it could drive moderate voters into the arms of the Lib Dems or even Labour. That might leave Mr Johnson with the worst of all worlds: winning some Leave voters in Labour strongholds, but not enough to counteract his losses in the middle-class suburbs and university towns.\n\nWhat an irony, if Nigel Farage\u2019s contribution to history is to put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street and to destroy any chance of Brexit at all. Stranger things have happened, mind you.\n\nThat 1918 was a one-off, and other December elections offer less rosy precedents. In December 1910, for example, Herbert Henry Asquith went to the country in a desperate attempt to break the stalemate in a deadlocked Commons. This sound familiar? But the impasse remained.\n\nThe Liberal-Tory balance merely shifted from 274-272 to 272-271. If a similar thing happened, we would be back to where we started.\n\nAt that point, pressure for a second referendum might become unstoppable \u2014 a disaster for British democracy.\n\nAn even more worrying precedent is December 1923. That winter, Conservative PM Stanley Baldwin \u2014 who, like Mr Johnson today, had only been in office since the summer \u2014 went to the polls to win a mandate for his policy of putting tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nHis gamble backfired completely, with the number of Tory MPs falling from 344 to just 258.\n\nAs a result, Labour\u2019s Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority administration, the first socialist government in Britain\u2019s history.\n\nThere is, perhaps, an omen there for Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIt is true, of course, that the December 2019 election will take place in an utterly different political, social and cultural landscape. But that only adds to the overwhelming uncertainty.\n\nNever in living memory has the context seemed so chaotic.\n\nEdward Heath meets members of the public when he visits Gravesend in Kent in 1974\n\nThe Tories may field some candidates who were recently stripped of the party whip for opposing a No Deal Brexit. It is not yet clear what one of those \u2014 ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond who\u2019s busy touring TV and radio studios to attack his government \u2014 will do.\n\nLabour remains riven from top to bottom. Not only are dozens of MPs openly appalled by their own leader, under whom the cancer of anti-Semitism has seeped deep into the party\u2019s culture, but they have no clear Brexit position.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lib Dems have their fourth leader in less than five years in the untested Jo Swinson, who has yanked her party into the extreme ultra-Remain position of wanting to revoke Article 50 and scrap Brexit completely.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rich, too, for them to have been clamouring for an early election when they insisted on the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which had stipulated there should not be another election until 2022.\n\nIn Scotland, the SNP seem certain to win a colossal majority, with the Tories and Labour facing a wipeout. The Greens will almost certainly pile up votes in university towns \u2014 but will they take more from Labour or the Lib Dems?\n\nAlso in this chaos, London seems certain to be a Labour stronghold, although the Lib Dems\u2019 Euro-fanaticism might make a difference. And what about all those Leave-voting seats in the North and Midlands? Are they really about to turn Tory, as Mr Johnson\u2019s strategists hope?\n\nOr will ancestral loyalties kick in, with working-class voters returning to the Labour fold?\n\nPictured: Edward Heath in September 1964\n\nCrucially, too, can Boris Johnson repair his reputation among women voters, given concerns about his chequered love-life? Will Mr Corbyn escape his own reputation for supporting terrorists, Communists and racists?\n\nHow all this will play out, none of us can say. Perhaps the biggest factor may be the campaign itself. Once the election gun is fired, even the most meticulous calculations buckle under the pressure of events, as Mrs May found.\n\nInevitably, the party leaders will come under pressure to hold televised debates. With one gaffe, either Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn could easily sink their chances. Yet can either afford to duck the challenge, as Mrs May did to her cost?\n\nThe Labour leader may be adrift in the polls but this is his last chance of power. He loves nothing better than haranguing crowds of loyal supporters; and as the last election proved, he is perfectly capable of raising his game once he is on the road.\n\nBy contrast, Mr Johnson \u2014 supposedly such a popular campaigner \u2014 can expect a bruising ride. Few Prime Ministers of modern times have provoked such visceral hatred in their opponents, and Labour activists will be primed to harass him wherever he goes, shrieking about austerity, cuts and homelessness.\n\nBut there is nothing to fear from the weather Political Correspondent, Larisa Brown: The first Christmas election in Britain since 1923 represents \u2018uncharted territory\u2019 \u2014 but voters are still likely to turn out, a top political academic said last night. Elections expert Sir John Curtice downplayed claims that voters would stay at home because of the cold weather and early nights. But it would be the first time in history that an election had taken place in the days before what has become a major secular holiday. Sir John said: \u2018This is the first time where you\u2019ve had an election in December against the backdrop of the biggest shut down in the year. We are in uncharted territory.\u2019 But he added: \u2018You can just about get away with December 12. It is sufficiently before people start going half way across the country to see relatives, or off on their holidays abroad.\u2019 Sir John, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, pointed out that there was a record turnout of 83.9 per cent in the winter election of 1950 and 78 per cent in 1974. The winter of 1974 was a particularly \u2018gruelling winter\u2019 he said because of the coal miners\u2019 strike which affected electricity. He added: \u2018If our great grandparents who didn\u2019t have central heating and were relying on gas lighting could manage, why can\u2019t we? \u2018We have a level of commitment to Remain or Leave of the kind we have not seen in party politics since the Sixties.\u2019 Opposition parties have claimed an election close to Christmas could irritate voters, while campaigning and getting the vote out could be hampered by cold weather. There are also concerns that venues such as church halls that would normally act as polling stations could be booked up in the run-up to Christmas for festive events. Laura Lock, of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said her members have been making calls, and finding many of the usual venues already have bookings. Last night, it also emerged that election officials are pressing for the right to delay an election count to the following day if severe weather puts the safety of their staff at risk. They fear travelling may be far more dangerous for officials who could face 100-mile round trips at night on treacherous roads to deliver ballot boxes to the counts.\n\nIf he skulks behind his media minders, he will be accused of cowardice. But if he ventures out on the streets, he risks the evening TV news being dominated by film of his shouting critics. The brutal truth is that Mr Johnson cannot expect to control the political narrative. He may tell us that this is a \u2018Brexit election\u2019 and insist it\u2019s a clear choice between decision and delay.\n\nBut elections never work out simply. As soon as the campaign begins, the focus will turn to the classic bread-and-butter issues of the economy, housing, schools and the NHS. And after ten years in office, the Tories will need compelling answers, as well as clear, constructive plans for the next five years.\n\nIn my more pessimistic moments, I can\u2019t help thinking of our last winter election, the \u2018Who Governs?\u2019 campaign of February 1974.\n\nThen, as now, a controversial Tory PM went to the country asking for a mandate for decisive action in the national interest.\n\nThen, it was Edward Heath, who urged voters to back him against the striking National Union of Mineworkers.\n\nBut Heath lost control of the election debate.\n\nBesieged by public anxieties about housing, the economy and the cost of living, the Tories ended up haemorrhaging votes to the Liberals.\n\nThe election produced a hung parliament and a deeply divided Labour Party took over, under the ageing but nevertheless victorious Harold Wilson.\n\nI doubt I\u2019m alone in finding that a chilling precedent.\n\nFor if today\u2019s Tories think it could never happen again, they are deluding themselves.\n\nAnd given the state of today\u2019s Labour Party, the stakes are even higher now.\n\nWhatever his faults, Wilson was a patriot, who always tried to put Britain first.\n\nNo fair-minded observer would ever say the same of Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nSo we come back to Boris Johnson\u2019s great gamble with history.\n\nIt is true that all great politicians are risk-takers.\n\nTo be a politician in the first place, you stake your career on the whims of innumerable individual voters, whose hopes and anxieties are often clouded by mystery.\n\nAnd the higher you climb, the higher the stakes.\n\nBut rarely in modern times has any prime minister taken such a gamble.
