Soon, though, a disturbing reality dawns on the viewer: Those cherished new belongings are merely tools to foil a school shooter stalking the children.\n\nAnd in a fashion show last week, the fashion brand Bstroy offered a sort of back-to-school vision of its own, with models showing off hoodies emblazoned with the names of four schools touched by mass shootings, rent by what appeared to be bullet holes.\n\nBoth used shock value to make a point about gun violence - and both are dealing with different levels of reaction, some positive and, in the case of the fashion show, a lot of it negative.\n\n\u201cThey knew exactly what they were doing in both cases and purposefully wanted to provoke it,\u201d said Paul Argenti, a communication professor at Dartmouth College.\n\nThe backlash to the hoodies - which carried the words Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, Columbine and Virginia Tech, sites of some of the deadliest school shootings - was swift and unforgiving after the fashion photos were posted last week on Instagram.\n\nSandy Hook Promise, the nonprofit that is led by relatives of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and that released the \u201cBack-to-School Essentials\u201d campaign ad Wednesday, was particularly vocal.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a designer would seek to profit by glamorizing the school violence that killed our children, Dylan and Daniel, and the deaths of so many more, is repugnant and deeply upsetting,\u201d said Nicole Hockley and Mark Barden, managing directors of Sandy Hook Promise, in a news release.\n\n\u201cNicole still has the bullet-ridden shirt Dylan was wearing the day he died,\u201d Aimee Thunberg, spokesperson for Sandy Hook Promise, said in an email. \u201cIt is sacred, and for someone to pretend to create something like it - for their own bank balance - is indecent.\u201d\n\nFred Guttenberg, father of Jaime Guttenberg, who died in the Parkland shooting, tweeted : \u201cUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea? This has me so upset. If any of my followers no anybody involved with this clothing line, please ask them to stop it immediately.\u201d\n\nBut as in many fashion shows, there was no intention to make the hoodies available for retail sale, said Bstroy co-founder Dieter Grams.\n\nMoreover, he said, he sees commonalities between the Sandy Hook ad and what he described as his own company\u2019s artistic attempt to bring attention to gun violence and honor its victims.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really well done,\u201d Grams said of the Sandy Hook ad. \u201cI\u2019m in support of it, and I think anyone who supports that video should see what we were trying to do with our art.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, Benetton caused an outcry with an ad showing the blood-soaked uniform of a Croat soldier killed in Bosnia, Argenti recalled. Urban Outfitters in 2014 sold a seemingly bloodstained Kent State University sweatshirt; it later pulled the item and apologized.\n\nArgenti advised creators to \u201chave some common sense even if you want to be disruptive\u201d and not choose examples that are too sensitive.\n\nHe said he found the Sandy Hook ad troubling for that reason, saying he wouldn\u2019t want his child to see it.\n\n\u201cIt starts out so lighthearted and then you get sucked in,\u201d Argenti said. The Sandy Hook ad is unlikely to stop any violence in schools, he said, \u201cjust freak out kids in school.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth questioning whether a lavishly produced video spot was the best way to deliver Sandy Hook Promise\u2019s message, said Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris, pointing out the nonprofit sells clothing, too.\n\n\u201cThat gets right back to entire aura of nonprofit marketing: What is the most efficient way to make a change in the world?\u201d he said.\n\nSandy Hook Promise\u2019s tweet of the ad leads to a website where users can make donations. Thunberg draws a distinction between its financial motives and Bstroy\u2019s, saying her group seeks to prevent violence by empowering children - not increase awareness of a clothing line in a crowded market.\n\n\u201cThat is exploitation and serves no good to anyone except Bstroy,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cProfiting from the tragedy of others is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nSome experts agreed. Robert Passikoff, president of the New York-based customer research firm Brand Keys, said the difference is in execution. The Sandy Hook commercial was well executed and emotionally engaging, he said, while the hoodies make a blunter point.\n\n\u201cOne was done so well and has people crying at the end,\u201d he said, \u201cThe other one was, well, OK, I got your point. One did it with a scalpel and one did it with an AK-47.\u201d\n\nGrams, of Bstroy, said he has gotten positive feedback, including from people touched by the shootings at the schools named on the hoodies.\n\nOne Parkland student whose brother died asked for a hoodie, he said. And a person from Newtown, where 20 children and six educators died at Sandy Hook Elementary, suggested casting models from the area for Bstroy\u2019s next show.\n\nGrams declined to divulge the identities of those who reached out, saying he did not want to violate their privacy.\n\nHad Bstroy expected such publicity, Grams said, he might have reached out beforehand to relatives of shooting victims. But because a fashion show presents ideas that aren\u2019t going to be circulated for a long time, he said, \u201cin our mind, we had six months to reach out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make very niche art shows; we had no idea this was going to be publicized the way it was,\u201d Grams said. \u201cWe had no idea we were going to get this kind of attention.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a breezy back-to-school video spot, angelic children describe their beloved new headphones, sneakers, skateboard.
