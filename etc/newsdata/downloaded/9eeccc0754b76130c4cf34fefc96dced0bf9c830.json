The small lizard-like reptiles are known for their ability to produce various loud sounds, from barks to chirps, to communicate or when threatened.\n\nWhile activists accuse Duterte of cowing his opponents into silence, reptiles and insects have no qualms about pestering him during his often hours-long, televised addresses.\n\nA big cockroach reut.rs/2Od6b4s crawled up his shoulder and down his shirt during a speech in May when he was lambasting an opposition party ahead of a national election.
