One, a dream of diversity and multiculturalism\u2014all-night fusion restaurants, Native American cafes with great cactus stew, and Tex-Mex skacore mosh pits that go all night. The other, a darker vision, that threatens it all, is a gentrifying monocultural nightmare masking a history of genocide and torture that erupts into white supremacist terrorism, xenophobia, and violence and which has been amped to a fever pitch under Donald Trump.\n\nThrow in tens of thousands of asylum seekers from across the world seeking to make their home in the U.S.A. and you have the place where the battle for the soul of the American Dream is taking place.\n\nEl Paso is where diversity fights for a home against America\u2019s own racist, psychotic demons, and asylum seekers fight for their vision of a better life.\n\nEven as the city is reeling from the deadliest racist terrorist violence in its recent history, new threats of racist violence are a part of life for those fighting for justice and human rights.\n\nHandout More\n\nIn the midst of all of this, a small group of indigenous activists are trying to make a stand. Their message: let\u2019s be human about this whole immigration thing please? They\u2019ve formed an ad hoc consortium of punk-rock humanitarian folks, \u201cFood Not Walls/Cosecha El Paso.\u201d It\u2019s a homegrown NGO that delivers supplies to migrants and tries to track down their separated children. It is doing God's work. Or, rather, let's say human work, because this is a fight for our humanity itself. Fighting the tide of hate and criminalization of immigrants, these folks are saying: we need to feed and clothe those in harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cWe are here to help the asylum seekers,\u201d says Crystal Moran from Food Not Walls/Cosecha El Paso. \u201cWe have seen horrible conditions\u2014overcrowding them in pens, no access to clean water, holding asylum seekers under the bridge basically out in the open where it was freezing cold, kids getting sick, with nothing but mylar blankets. It was horrible.\u201d\n\nAs we ride through the streets in Moran's souped-up black Mustang, everywhere are the physical reminders of recent atrocities: here a huge football-field sized tent city where thousands of migrants were held in unsanitary conditions, a place where police brutalized and arrested protesters.\n\nWe pass by hidden guard posts under highway overpasses; places where migrants drowned; militarized CBP, DHS and ICE on street corners and in bars; and huge military installations ringing the city. And it seems like everywhere you look\u2014the wall, the wall, the wall. As you ride the border highway, the wall dances along the Rio Grande, jumps over bridges and overpasses, it ripples along like a mirage that is always somehow right next to you, like a phantasm looking over your shoulder, a dark shadow that streaks across the center of your mind. A constant reminder that when you peer into Mexico, across the ravine into Juarez, that you can\u2019t get there from here or vice versa.\n\nCrystal and I drop off supplies to Annunciation House, a charitable organization operating out of a warehouse where migrants are trying to regroup after detention. The atmosphere is one of hushed secrecy. The threat of violence against those trying to help migrants is palpable, constant. Crystal is unpaid, and like her cohorts at this tiny NGO, she spends most of her free time trying to help the migrants. She sees her activism as part of her indigenous culture\u2014she is Coahuilteco and practices Aztec dance. She reminds me, \u201cThese migration routes are thousands of years old, they exist far before any borders.\u201d\n\nWe rush to a relative\u2019s house for more supplies to deliver\u2014food, clothes, diapers, feminine hygiene products\u2014and the phone rings.
