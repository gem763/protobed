Col. Alexander S. Vindman will become the latest official Tuesday to testify to a corrupt quid pro quo. And he might be the most significant to date, given his profile and his proximity to some of the key events.\n\nAccording to his prepared testimony, Vindman will say that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland said after a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official that a long-sought meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump depended upon Ukraine launching specific investigations \u2014 those involving former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a conspiracy theory about the origins of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmb. Sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time [National Security Adviser John] Bolton cut the meeting with [top Ukraine official Oleksandr Danylyuk] short. Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.\n\nVindman adds that he raised concerns about the arrangement \u2014 both immediately to Sondland and twice to a top National Security Council lawyer.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\u201d Vindman says.\n\nVindman says elsewhere in his testimony that he didn\u2019t just think the arrangement was wrong, but that he viewed it as harmful to U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nVindman is the fifth person to say there was a quid pro quo. Along with Taylor, Sondland reportedly admitted to some kind of quid pro quo in his testimony, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted to one publicly before walking back his comments, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) indicated there was one in public interviews.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s why Vindman is different than the others, though: In addition to delivering it in sworn testimony, that testimony is the first by a White House official who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. His opening statement doesn\u2019t dwell on that call too much \u2014 he does say, \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security\u201d \u2014 but that gives you a sense of how close to these decisions and conversations he was.\n\nBy contrast, Taylor\u2019s most significant allegation is secondhand, relying upon another official telling him that Sondland had conveyed the quid pro quo to a top Ukrainian official. (We\u2019re still waiting for the testimony of that official, Tim Morrison.) And Sondland seemed to be putting a good face on whatever quid pro quo existed.\n\nAD\n\nVindman\u2019s profile also reads like someone who was almost crafted to be an unassailable witness. He was born in the Soviet Union, meaning he\u2019s someone who would seem to have a genuine interest in the stability of the region. He has been a U.S. military officer and diplomat for more than two decades, serving under both Democratic and Republican presidents. He also served in combat operations in Iraq and was injured in an IED attack, receiving a Purple Heart.\n\nAD\n\nAs with Taylor, of course, that doesn\u2019t mean Trump\u2019s supporters won\u2019t try to attack Vindman. It even began on Monday night, after the New York Times first reported on his impending testimony.\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham noted that the Times reported Ukraine sought advice from Vindman on how to deal with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, because Vindman is fluent in their language.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?!\u201d\n\nJohn Yoo, a veteran of the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, then took that ball and ran with it. He called it \u201castounding\u201d and added, \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d according to the Daily Beast.\n\nAD\n\n(The irony here, of course, is that it was actually Giuliani who was working outside official channels to conduct foreign policy.)\n\nThe problem for people like Yoo, Ingraham and others is that Vindman is merely the latest to testify to a direct link between these specific investigations and official favors for the Ukrainian government \u2014 whether the favor is a meeting or the release of hundreds of million of dollars in military aid. There appear to be lots and lots of people who were at least tangentially aware of this, and now we have firsthand witnesses testifying to it as well.\n\nThey can certainly try to knock each and every one of them down, but it\u2019s going to become more and more difficult as more and more people step forward.\n\nAnd when you have to start attacking the Purple Heart guy, you know you\u2019re in a bad spot. And if this effort is geared at getting other witnesses to clam up, it doesn\u2019t appear to be working.\n\nAD", "description": "Vindman will become the latest witness to testify to a corrupt quid pro quo between the Trump team and Ukraine.
