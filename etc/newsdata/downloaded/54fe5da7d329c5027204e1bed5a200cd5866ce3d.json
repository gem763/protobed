(April 29) AP, AP\n\nThe financial hit from the prolonged grounding of the Boeing 737 Max continues to mount for airlines, and the CEOs who run them are toughening their talk about making Boeing pay for the damage.\n\nAmerican Airlines on Thursday said it has lost an estimated $700 million in revenue from nearly 30,000 flight cancellations forced by the grounding. The best- selling Boeing plane, the latest version of its workhorse 737, was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in less than five months killed 346 people.\n\nAmerican had 24 Max 8s in its fleet at the time of the grounding and had more scheduled to be delivered throughout the year. Without the planes, it has had to cut planned flights. There were 9,475 from July-September alone. The airline has pulled the 737 Max out of its schedule through mid-January.\n\nAmerican reported a $425 million quarterly profit but CEO Doug Parker said the results \"should have been even better'' were it not for the Max impact and a major labor dispute that led to additional flight cancellations.\n\n\"We're working to ensure that Boeing shareholders bear the cost of Boeing's failures, not American Airlines shareholders,'' he said on the airline's third-quarter earnings conference call Thursday.\n\nParker said talks with Boeing about compensation are in the early stages but he said the airline is \"highly confident'' the losses American has incurred \"will be borne by the Boeing shareholders.\n\nCheck your flight: American removes 737 Max from schedule through holiday travel rush\n\nSouthwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are parked on the tarmac after being grounded, at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville March 28.

The airline said the grounding has reduced its operating profit by $435 million through Sept. 30, with the financial damage expected to continue to grow.\n\nSouthwest, which had 34 Max 8s in its fleet at the time of the grounding and was due to add another 41 by year's end, has now taken the plane out of its schedule into early February due to continued uncertainty about the timing of the plane's return.\n\nBoeing 737 Max: Southwest Airlines extends cancellations into February\n\nKelly said Southwest's Chief Financial Officer, Tammy Romo, is leading the compensation negotiations with Boeing. Southwest was the launch customer for the Max and is an all-Boeing airline so it is a critical customer for the aircraft maker.\n\nHe said he's looking for a quick resolution.\n\n\"I'm impatient on that,'' he said on the airline's earnings conference call Thursday. \"It's a major objective of ours, of mine, and I want that wrapped up quickly.''\n\nBoeing said over the summer that it has set aside $5 billion to compensate airlines for their losses from the grounding.\n\nSouthwest's pilots union is seeking its own payout from Boeing. In early October, Southwest Pilots Association filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer, saying the Max-related flight cancellations have cost pilots $115 million in compensation.\n\nSouthwest pilots sue Boeing: Suit alleges negligence, fraudulent representation\n\nWill the Boeing 737 Max ever fly again?
