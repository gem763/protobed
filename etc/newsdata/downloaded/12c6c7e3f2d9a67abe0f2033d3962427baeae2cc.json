The new features were originally supposed to ship alongside iOS 13 but were delayed back in September.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve updated your HomePod, the speaker will be able to tell up to six different voices apart, providing personalized music, calendar, reminders, and messages for that specific person. (In other words, you won\u2019t have to worry about your roommates sending prank messages through your HomePod.) Other smart speakers, like Google\u2019s Assistant-powered devices, have supported similar functionality for years, but it\u2019s nice to see Apple finally catching up.\n\nAlso new with iOS 13.2 is a handoff feature that will let you seamlessly transition music, podcasts, or phone calls directly from your iPhone to your HomePod simply by moving the phone close to the speaker. There\u2019s also a new \u201cAmbient Sounds\u201d feature for playing a variety of different types of white noise and sleep timers for falling asleep to either music or Ambient Sounds.\n\nThe full changelog of new HomePod features is listed below:", "description": "Apple has finally released the promised fall update for its HomePod smart speaker with iOS 13.2, adding the ability for the speaker to tell different voices apart for proper multiuser support.
