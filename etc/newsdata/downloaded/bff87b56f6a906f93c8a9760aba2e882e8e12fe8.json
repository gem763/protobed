PMI figures show the manufacturing and service sectors contracting, consumer confidence has been falling and growth slowing.\n\nSeptember inflation figures, however, were in line with the Riksbank's forecast.\n\nWhile the Riksbank in September stuck with its forecast of a rate hike late this year or early next, analysts see a very small chance of tighter policy before 2020 and many believe rates will be on hold at -0.25% for some time to come.\n\nThe central bank will publish its next monetary policy decision on Oct. 24.
