Davis/Getty Images 2020 elections Biden's Democratic rivals tiptoe around Trump-Ukraine grenade They're wrestling with how aggressively to defend a man they badly want to defeat.\n\nDemocratic candidates on the sidelines of the Trump-Biden Ukraine showdown are confronting an unmistakable tension in their campaigns: How far to go in their defense of a presidential rival.\n\nMost of Biden\u2019s chief opponents are renewing their calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment after the president allegedly pressured Ukrainian leaders to open an investigation into Biden and his son in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid. They\u2019ve blasted the president for \u201cviolating our constitutional mandates\u201d and denounced his appeals for the probe as a \u201cpolitical threat.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut they\u2019re facing growing calls from diverse voices in the party to do even more, including rallying around Biden in more forceful ways for the good of the country \u2014 and at possible expense to their own campaigns. Compounding the pressure is Biden\u2019s position atop the field, and their need for him to fall in order for them to gain.\n\nAides to 10 Democratic candidates acknowledged the internal strain in interviews with POLITICO, stressing they need to avert a repeat of 2016, when Trump capitalized on Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Several expressed sensitivities around the candidates saying anything that could be construed as helping advance Trump and his allies\u2019 storylines. Yet the candidates and their aides have mostly tried to turn the conversation back toward Trump\u2019s actions, rather than speaking up for Biden.\n\n\u201cI think they should go out of their way to defend Biden,\u201d James Carville, the former senior strategist to Bill Clinton, said of Biden's rivals. Carville has joined party elders to implore House Democrats to formally launch impeachment proceedings. \u201cThat is the smart political play because he\u2019s being attacked by Trump. If you are being attacked by a guy that is 100% unfavorable it should not hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know what happened, OK?\u201d Carville added, citing the lack of evidence that Biden did anything improper. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be cute about. This is an outrage.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3744/1155968404_6089157105001_6089152801001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nStill, some campaigns pushed back on the idea of giving blanket cover to Biden when the issue remains a moving target \u2014 and while there may be non-Ukraine-related activity that could plunge him into trouble and hamstring his bid. They believe Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have acted so outrageously that even potential credible, non-biased reporting on the subject in the future might be easy for Biden to brush aside.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 remarks on the subject seemed to underscore the pressure Biden\u2019s opponents are under. At a campaign stop Tuesday in Iowa, Sanders reiterated his calls for an impeachment inquiry and said he believes the president has committed impeachable offenses. But Sanders said he wants to see more evidence before opining on whether Trump should be impeached.\n\n\u201cTrump likely engaged in obstruction of justice with regard to the Mueller investigation,\u201d Sanders said, adding, \u201cWe appear to have a president who unbelievably may have used security funds ... as a means to gain political dirt on an opponent.\u201d\n\nSanders was asked by a reporter whether he considers Hunter Biden fair game for scrutiny, particularly after Sanders urged Americans to move on from the Clinton email story in 2016. Sanders said he prefers to see evidence before weighing in.\n\n\u201cYou make the judgment,\u201d Sanders balked in response to a separate question about whether it makes Biden a weaker candidate. \u201cYou guys write very perceptive articles on these things.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine story has dominated the headlines for days and pushed candidates into sometimes uncomfortable territory. As the story broke last week, Kamala Harris accused the president of attacking American democracy and urged he \u201cleave Joe alone,\u201d one of the sturdiest defenses to date from one of his Democratic opponents.\n\nOn Monday in Los Angeles, Harris called the possibility of an investigation into Joe or Hunter Biden part of a \u201cpolitical threat,\" saying, \u201cI have no support for it.\u201d\n\nYet asked whether the Ukraine story adds to the \u201cnarrative\u201d that Biden has baggage, Harris deflected: \u201cI\u2019ll leave that to the voters to decide.\u201d\n\nPart of the tension stems from the reality that much of the field needs Biden\u2019s campaign to collapse. But it would be poor form \u2014 and could come off as un-American \u2014 for a rival campaign to look like they\u2019re capitalizing on Trump\u2019s gambit. Warnings have come from some unlikely quarters: The Intercept, a liberal publication that's been critical of Biden\u2019s campaign, carried a column by the writer Robert Mackey under the headline: \u201cReporters should stop helping Donald Trump spread lies about Joe Biden and Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny candidate that were to echo Trump\u2019s bad-faith attack would be ending their campaign at that very moment,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama adviser and co-host of \u201cPod Save America.\u201d \u201c[Juli\u00e1n] Castro's approval numbers in the Iowa Poll should be a bright flashing red light for anyone that attacks a fellow Democrat in a \u2018Trumpian\u2019 fashion.\u201d\n\nPfeiffer advised the Democratic candidates to defend Biden \u201cand then move on to the fact that the president has admitted to committing multiple crimes beyond the pale of anything Nixon did in Watergate.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, aboard his media bus tour of Iowa, nodded in that direction, arguing that Democrats shouldn\u2019t allow Trump to change the subject to Hunter Biden after the president himself acted nefariously.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any indication of anything there, anyway,\u201d Buttigieg said of Hunter, before pivoting to how he thinks Democrats should deal with Trump\u2019s tactics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember that they\u2019ll either find a vulnerability or they\u2019ll invent one for everybody,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t get in our heads more than the most glaring issue that deserves attention, which is the fact that the president of the United States has confessed to a nefarious act. \u2026 It\u2019s a big deal. And I don\u2019t think we should talk past that question until we get the answer.\u201d\n\nDemocrats moved in that direction Tuesday, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s long-running efforts to resist an impeachment inquiry came to an end. Biden himself said Congress has no choice but to impeach Trump if he doesn\u2019t comply with ongoing investigations, including into Ukraine.\n\nSeveral of the 2020 Democratic campaign aides said they\u2019d continue to put the onus on Trump and impeachment, a big focus of late for Harris, as well as Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. Late Monday, the New Jersey senator accused Trump, who authorized the release of a transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, of \u201cacting more like a dictator.\u201d\n\nWithout mentioning Biden, Booker called it a \u201cmoral moment\u201d to hold the president accountable.\n\nHolly Otterbein and Elena Schneider contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "They're wrestling with how aggressively to defend a man they badly want to defeat.", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/17/bc/46db647f450db8150d401faa1642/190924-bernie-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
