(Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe family said in its statement that their son, Alaa, regrets what happened.\n\n\"That said, he did not in any way verbally or physically assault the elderly woman and has nonetheless offered to apologize personally for not doing more,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Alaa has been an activist and humanitarian for the past 9 years, fighting for the rights of oppressed communities in Canada and worldwide. We support and love our son for standing up against oppression.\"\n\nThe family also said their son was doxed \u2014 meaning his personal information was released online with malicious intent \u2014 and physically assaulted.\n\n\"Our family and business do not condone acts of hate, violence or harassment in any shape or form,\" the statement said. \"We want to restate that we are not affiliated with any political group or organization or either side of the political spectrum. We simply believe in kindness, peace and understanding between all people.\"\n\nA large crowd of protesters decrying the appearance by Bernier at Mohawk College stood outside with signs advocating for immigrant rights and yelling chants denouncing those entering, comparing them to Nazis and neo-Nazis. Supporters of the People's Party \u2014 some wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats \u2014 stood behind police and verbally engaged with some of the protesters for about an hour.\n\nA scuffle occurred in the crowd of around 100 about half an hour before the event was scheduled to start. Two men from opposing sides were led away in handcuffs by police.\n\nA peaceful protest outside an event for Maxime Bernier turned violent Sunday evening as supporters of the People's Party of Canada began to arrive and enter the venue. 0:36\n\nThe restaurant's website outlines how the owners, Husam and Shahnaz Al-Soufi, immigrated to Canada in 2015 and opened what they described as \"downtown Toronto's first Syrian restaurant and cafe.\"\n\nThe two have three children \u2014 Alaa, Jala and Ayham \u2014 according to the website.\n\nIn their statement, the family said they know the hatred they have seen \"does not reflect the people of Toronto.\n\n\"The people of Toronto are loving, welcoming people. We have heard from countless community members and organizations who have restored our faith in the city.\"\n\nThis message of support was taped to the restaurant's window on Tuesday.
