Then I\u2019d driven on. Now I stood above the village of Slaidburn, looking over moorland and fells undulating away indefinitely. Drystone walls imposed order, but not much.\n\nClouds swept across the sky, anxious to be elsewhere. I climbed on to a little rock, flung my arms wide and cried: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I give you the Forest of Bowland. I give you the Ribble Valley. I give you\u2026 Lancashire!\u201d Then I stepped down, to no applause. There was nobody else around.\n\nWhich is a key part of the appeal. This wonderful stretch of England is little populated, little visited and yet, according to Office for National Statistics figures released this week, the Ribble Valley \u2013 which includes the Forest of Bowland \u2013 is the happiest place in Britain. With a rating of 8.30 out of ten, it is very slightly happier than the second-placed Orkney islands on 8.29.", "description": "Explore Lancashire and the Forest of Bowland, one of England's areas of natural beauty, with our Telegraph Travel expert and see why this is our own Tuscany.", "authors": ["Anthony Peregrine", "Destination Expert"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/bowland-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
