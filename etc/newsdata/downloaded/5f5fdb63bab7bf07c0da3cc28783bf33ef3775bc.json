In my haste to get the timeline of events out, I included a text w/sensitive information, that was sent to me by Tommy, using MJ's phone.'\n\nHe continued: 'For that I'm truly sorry. I had forgotten that was in there and genuinely wish I could go back and cut that one out. Unfortunately it's out and I'm very sorry.'\n\nAdding: 'Our lives are more important than a feud.
