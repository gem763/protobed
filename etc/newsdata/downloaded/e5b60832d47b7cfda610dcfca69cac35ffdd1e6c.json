Dan Reehil of Nashville\u2019s St. Edward Catholic School said he consulted exorcists in the U.S. and Rome who recommended removing the books.\n\nReehil wrote, \u201cThe curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.\u201d\n\nCatholic Diocese of Nashville superintendent Rebecca Hammel said Reehil has the final say at his school.\n\nHammel said she thinks the books by J.K. Rowling are still on the shelves of other libraries in the diocese.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Catholic school in Tennessee has removed the Harry Potter series from its library after the school's priest decided the books could cause a reader to conjure evil spirits.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/AP_92561848844_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3"}
