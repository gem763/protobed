Apparently the agency is no longer worried that Swarm\u2019s sandwich-sized satellites are too small to be tracked.\n\nThe company\u2019s SpaceBEE satellites are tiny things that will provide a connection to devices that might otherwise be a pain to get online. Think soil monitors in the middle of corn fields, or buoys in the middle of the ocean. Their signals don\u2019t need low latency or high bandwidth \u2014 so the requirements for a satellite that serves them are much lower than for consumer broadband.\n\nConsequently Swarm\u2019s satellites are small \u2014 so small in fact that the FCC was worried that they would be difficult to track and might be a danger to other satellites. Part of the company\u2019s responsibility in its application was to show that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nThe FCC approval is just one step in the long process of getting approved to go to space for commercial operations, but it\u2019s a big one. In addition to granting Swarm permission to send up its planned 150 satellites (and up to 600 if it decides to spread out a little), the FCC assigned Swarm the wireless spectrum it needs to operate. No use being in space if you\u2019re forbidden from transmitting on the frequencies you need, right?\n\nLongtime satellite communications provider ORBCOMM had objected that Swarm would be taking over some parts of the spectrum it has been assigned \u2014 but the FCC found that wasn\u2019t actually the case and in fact the company was in a way making a sort of power play that would have extended its control over those frequencies. So their concerns were dismissed.\n\nSpaceX also filed a comment suggesting that Swarm had not adequately considered its orbital debris footprint, neglecting in particular to include its satellites\u2019 antennas in various calculations. It also said the satellites might be a risk to the International Space Station. But documents filed by Swarm addressing these questions seem to have satisfied the FCC completely \u2014 \u201cWe find that Swarm has taken the appropriate steps to address SpaceX\u2019s concerns,\u201d and it granted the application with the condition that the company abide by any upcoming orbital debris rules.\n\nSwarm has clearly moved well past the black mark on its FCC record when it launched test satellites without the proper approvals. The red tape involved in space operations is voluminous and it\u2019s not uncommon to fall afoul of it \u2014 especially when your competitors, as evidenced by the above, are making more of it for you.\n\nNow that it has its paperwork in order, Swarm plans to get its entire constellation in orbit by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe FCC grant of Swarm\u2019s spectrum and launch approvals is a big milestone for the company. Swarm is now poised to be first to market for an entire global satellite data communications constellation before the end of 2020,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Sara Spangelo in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThis is an important moment for the satellite industry, for US innovation in space, and for the large number of IoT customers world-wide that Swarm is excited to support with 2-way data services,\u201d added CTO and co-founder Ben Longmire.\n\nBoth Sara and Ben were at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this month, and the former sat on a panel with Bessemer Venture Partners\u2019 Tess Hatch and OneWeb CEO Adrian Steckel (with myself as moderator). We chatted about a variety of topics relating to the new space economy \u2014 if you\u2019re thinking of getting up there yourself, you might be interested to watch it below.", "description": "Swarm Technologies aims to connect smart devices around the world with a low-bandwidth but ever-present network provided by satellites \u2014 and it just got approval from the FCC to do so.
