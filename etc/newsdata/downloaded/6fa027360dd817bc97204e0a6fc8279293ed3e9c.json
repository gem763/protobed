Adamson met William Barr, Trump\u2019s attorney general, on 21 September, during the prime minister\u2019s recent visit to Washington.\n\nThe timelines, which shed new light on Australia\u2019s participation in the Barr probe, emerged during a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Thursday.\n\n\u2018Delicate moment\u2019: was Scott Morrison\u2019s Lowy speech a pivot towards Trumpism? Read more\n\nOn 25 May Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr.\n\nThe Mueller investigation began after Australia\u2019s former foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer was allegedly told by George Papadopoulos, then a Trump campaign aide, that Russia had obtained damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails. Downer then informed US authorities.\n\nTrump said in late May he hoped Barr would \u201clook at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, then signalled publicly that the government was prepared to contribute to the Barr investigation if asked. Payne said at the time Australia had not yet been asked but \u201cwe would, of course, consider such a request were it to be made\u201d.\n\nHockey went further, writing to Barr, copying in the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. The ambassador said: \u201cThe Australian government will use its best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter.\n\n\u201cWhile Australia\u2019s former high commissioner to the United Kingdom, the Hon Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries.\u201d\n\nWhile officials from Morrison\u2019s department declined to answer questions about the Barr process in a separate hearing on Monday, Dfat officials said on Thursday it had been Hockey\u2019s idea to signal a more forward-leading position to the Trump administration.\n\nPayne told Thursday\u2019s hearing Hockey had first flagged that idea with her. Asked by Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, whether the evidence was Hockey had agreed on Australia\u2019s behalf to participate in the Barr probe without being asked, the secretary of the department Frances Adamson said: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nHockey then met privately with Barr, and Adamson met with the US attorney general in late September, having been nominated as the Canberra point of contact. There have been at least four meetings between Australian officials and Americans involved in the Trump investigation.\n\nDfat officials declined to answer questions about what had been discussed, or whether Australia had supplied the investigation with diplomatic cables. Payne told Thursday\u2019s hearing she had not discussed the Barr inquiry with Downer and neither had Morrison \u201cto my knowledge\u201d. Adamson said she had discussed the probe with Downer.\n\nOfficials declined to answer whether Downer had asked for either legal or financial support from the government in relation to the Barr probe on the basis the answer would be prejudicial both to a live investigation and to Australia\u2019s relationship with the US. Wong objected to the lack of disclosure. \u201cWhy is that a secret?\u201d\n\nAlexander Downer: the Australian blue blood accused of being an anti-Trump 'spy' Read more\n\nOfficials also declined to answer whether Downer had relayed the insights from Papadopoulos to the American charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in London in July 2016. Guardian Australia revealed at the start of October that Downer had taken the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he shared information with his American counterpart in London.\n\nDowner\u2019s conversation with Papadopoulos was recorded in a diplomatic cable back to Canberra, according to senior sources.\n\nBut the first senior players in Canberra knew of Downer\u2019s conversation with America\u2019s top diplomat in London about Russia obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails was when the Australian government was contacted subsequently by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more information. That diplomat-to-diplomat conversation was unauthorised.\n\nAsked by Wong on Thursday whether Payne had confidence that Downer acted appropriately, the foreign minister said: \u201cYes senator.\u201d\n\nHockey has previously flatly rejected a description by the Senate judiciary committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, of Downer\u2019s \u201cdirected\u201d role in relaying information to US authorities about the Clinton emails.\n\nIn a recent letter to Graham, the ambassador insists Downer wasn\u2019t directed. \u201cWe reject your characterisation of his role. As you have requested, we will work closely with the attorney-general to resolve any misunderstandings in this matter.\u201d", "description": "Joe Hockey offered to assist Donald Trump\u2019s highly charged probe aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e008807f41eb77854fcb0b3e592df09884d4f78/1192_673_4025_2415/master/4025.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6e2d8676ef65fa81dd35255e11a905e", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
