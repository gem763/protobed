Not bad for an artist who was all but ignored in his lifetime, dismissed by many who knew him as insane, and died in poverty and obscurity in 1827.\n\nBeset since childhood by visions of angels and demons who peered through his windows and accosted him in stairwells, Blake spent his years writing riddling prophecies that few read and producing watercolours that fewer wanted to buy. After decades of unheralded toil, he managed to organise only a single solo exhibition of his work. By all accounts, it was a disaster.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The artist revealing our ghosts\n\n- A brutal death in New York\u2019s art world\n\n- The ultimate painter of war?\n\n\u201cThe problem with Blake,\u201d the late Romantic scholar Jonathan Wordsworth once told me, \u201cis he couldn\u2019t draw\u201d. Anyone who has ever cringed at the naive and toothless tabby that sulks beneath \u2018fearful symmetry\u2019, the ferocious final phrase of Blake\u2019s poem The Tyger in his 1794 collection Songs of Innocence and Experience, will have a certain sympathy with Wordsworth\u2019s uncharitable jab. And yet, despite Blake\u2019s occasional awkwardness as a draughtsman, his work is a case study in soulfulness over finesse, profundity over proficiency.\n\nConfident that the full significance of his work would one day be appreciated by posterity, Blake consoled himself that, rather than appealing to the blunt sensibilities of his day, he was ahead of his time and \u201claboured upwards to futurity\u201d. He was right. In the two centuries since he passed away, singing sweetly on his deathbed of what he saw in Heaven, Blake has overcome every limitation of circumscribed skill and contemporary disfavour that hindered him. He has become, according to Martin Myrone, the lead curator of a new exhibition of Blake\u2019s work at Tate Britain, the very \u201cmodel of the autonomous genius and isolated visionary\u201d.\n\nA singular vision\n\nTate\u2019s comprehensive retrospective, its first in nearly a generation, features more than 300 drawings, paintings, watercolours, woodcuts, and illustrated books, and provides the perfect opportunity to explore the secrets behind Blake\u2019s ever-evolving legacy and to contemplate the emergence in popular imagination of a London eccentric whose ambition was to help us \u201csee a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower\u201d, to \u201chold Infinity in the palm of [our] hand / And Eternity in an hour\u201d.\n\nBlake\u2019s ability, granularly, to narrow his focus to a single speck of the material world and to perceive eternal poignancies in it, is instructive for how best to appreciate the intensities and achievement of his own work. Visitors to the show, Myrone says, may be surprised by the small scale of many of the artist\u2019s best-known works, which we are accustomed to experiencing artificially exploded into dorm-room posters or shrunk down to electronic thumbnails that we hold in the palm of our hands. \u201cYou can look at every Blake you could wish to see on your phone,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t the same thing as seeing them in the flesh.\u201d\n\nThere is something about zooming in that enlarges one\u2019s perception\n\nThere is indeed something about zooming in that enlarges one\u2019s perception. It is only when we adjust our eyes to the small (46 x 60 cm) aperture through which Blake invites us to glimpse his submarine sighting of Newton that we appreciate the cramped and claustrophobic tensions that squeeze the work into meaning. Perched uncomfortably on a coral-encrusted stone shelf in what appears to be an underwater grotto, Newton stretches awkwardly to doodle on a scroll of parchment that he has unfurled at his feet \u2013 an awkward ergonomics that makes Rodin\u2019s rocky Thinker look positively cosy. Newton\u2019s imperturbable gaze and the precise positioning of his spindly fingers suggest he is on the verge of a cognitive breakthrough, as if he has cracked the code that will unlock the mysteries of the universe: an emblem, surely, of the invincible power of the human mind amid the myriad discomforts and pressures of our world.\n\nOr is it? Look closer, and the instrument with which Blake has calculatingly equipped the renowned English physicist and mathematician is one we\u2019ll encounter time and again in the most famous of Blake\u2019s works: a pair of draughtsman\u2019s compasses. In Blake\u2019s unique visual vocabulary, the implement is shorthand for the pinching tight of human perception and becomes a kind of \u201cmind forg\u2019d manacle\u201d that enslaves our vision.\n\nFar from celebrating the genius of Newton, Blake\u2019s often-reproduced colour print is really an admonishment of misguided faith in scientific reason\n\nFar from celebrating the genius of Newton, a leading thinker of the scientific revolution, Blake\u2019s often-reproduced colour print (which the Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi famously alchemised into a hulking bronze statue that guards the entrance to the British Library) is really an admonishment of lumbering rationality and misguided faith in scientific reason over what Blake believed were the more profound and liberating powers of the imagination.\n\nOnce spotted, the pair of compasses becomes, ironically, a kind of key that picks open the doors of Blake\u2019s own perception \u2013 a recurring artistic tic whose symbolic pointedness jimmies the genius of some of his most iconic images and designs. We encounter the compasses again in Blake\u2019s stirring design for the frontpiece of his 1794 publication Europe: A Prophecy. His so-called Ancient of Days depicts a suspended deity, enthroned in a celestial orb and surrounded by smouldering clouds, stretching downwards to jab terrestrial creation with an enormous pair of compasses. In the context of Blake\u2019s complex mythologies, the wizened figure (whose chiselled physique recalls Michelangelo\u2019s muscular, sky-surfing God on the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel) is the fearsome demiurge Urizen, the embodiment of empirical thinking, who is responsible for imposing limits on our existence.\n\nBut like all great works of art, the mesmerising image, which Blake would return to again and again throughout his life (he was even working on a version of it while propped up with pillows at the time of his death), has prised itself loose from the narrow confines of its initial creation and etched itself in cultural consciousness as something more elastic and inspiring than merely an admonishment of reason. According to Blake, the work was a faithful transcription of a visionary encounter he\u2019d had while climbing the stairs in his home in Hercules Road, North Lambeth, in London, where he and his wife Catherine lived throughout the 1790s. Among the chief aims of the Tate show, Myrone tells me, is to recreate something of the ambiance of those very spaces in which Blake\u2019s imagination crept and was routinely accosted by visitors from the invisible world.\n\nTo that end, the Tate has reconstructed the very room in the Georgian hosiery shop in Broad Street, Golden Square, owned by Blake\u2019s brother James, where the artist\u2019s ill-fated one-off exhibition was staged between May and September 1809. \u201cPaintings which you are used to seeing in a gallery context,\u201d Myrone says, will be shown in \u201ca room which is half the height of our normal gallery space with creaky wooden floorboards, and with a skirting board, and with a window\u201d. By returning Blake\u2019s work to a space they once inhabited, Myrone believes they will \u201clook like much stranger objects\u2026 because they are small and dark and hard to interpret and hard to read\u201d.\n\nBy bringing Blake\u2019s works down from the mythic eminence to which they\u2019ve been exalted, Myrone is hoping to reintroduce the artist to a new generation of gallery goers and \u201cto present\u201d, as the curator explains in the handsome catalogue that accompanies the show, \u201ca \u2018Blake for all\u2019\u201d. \u201cThe approach taken here,\u201d Myrone writes, \u201cis determinedly historicist and materialist. This means, simply, that we think that it really matters where and when these artworks were created, who got to see them and what they seem to have thought, who collected them. This means, among other things, shifting attention from the epic and dense poetry to the watercolours and paintings.\u201d\n\nBy inviting us to consider first and foremost the visual achievement of Blake\u2019s artistic inventions, disentangled from the poetic context that often occasioned them, Myrone hopes to reprioritise how we perceive his contribution to cultural history. \u201cThere has been a shift towards thinking about the visual aspects of his work much more,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously Blake is both a painter and a poet and that interplay has always been important. [But] even literary scholars have ended up saying \u2018well Blake was primarily a watercolour painter, he is secondarily a poet\u2019\u2026 Throughout his career, throughout his life, he focused on watercolour painting.\u201d\n\nThat realignment influences how we approach and respond to the works on display, especially those we think we know, such as the often-reproduced colour print known as Albion Rose or Glad Day, whose exuberance adorns a vast inventory of upbeat museum merchandise. By removing the intimidating expectation that we must first locate the giddy figure within Blake\u2019s cosmologies and convoluted creation myth of his writing, we\u2019re able to see the image afresh and in an outward-extending dialogue with other icons of art history.\n\nFreed from the tethers of its own inception, the work opens a conversation with its most obvious precursor, Leonardo\u2019s Vitruvian Man, which celebrates the exquisite proportions of the human body by illustrating the Roman architect Vitruvius\u2019s observation that the anatomical extent of man conforms to a circle created by \u201ca pair of compasses centred at his navel\u201d. But Blake refuses to be trapped by the geometries of a fallen world and dissolves the fetters of the offending compasses by erasing altogether the circle (and square) with which Leonardo ensnares his subject, allowing the young boy to step out unshackled into a limitless world. Always original, always breaking free, Blake\u2019s truest genius lies in his ability to help us dream outside the sphere.\n\nWilliam Blake is at Tate Britain until 2 February 2020.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
