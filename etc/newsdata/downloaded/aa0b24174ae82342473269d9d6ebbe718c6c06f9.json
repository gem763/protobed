Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb \u2019s Third Point and Nelson Peltz \u2019s Trian Fund Management have all swayed huge targets with a relatively small presence in recent years.\n\nA week ago, Paul Singer \u2019s Elliott Management flagged a $3.2 billion investment in AT&T , the telecom giant with a $280 billion market capitalization, in a letter demanding big changes. Elliott\u2019s stake in the company and subsequent campaign will gain it notoriety and probably will become a distraction for management in the coming months. It is asking AT&T to consider unwinding some of the current chief executive officer\u2019s landmark initiatives\u2014a major reversal.\n\nIn many cases, though, it isn\u2019t clear whether companies would have taken decisions on their own accord.\n\nUnlike passive investors, activists agitate to make changes to corporate structure or other operations, often asking them to give their own representatives a seat at the table. To gain the control they need, they typically take decent-sized stakes. Activists that take on targets with a market capitalization of more than $500 million, which constitutes roughly 200 campaigns a year since 2013, take 6% stakes on average, but often approaching 8%, according to data published by Lazard\u2019s advisory group.\n\nThat is clearly far harder in the case of the largest corporations, necessitating smaller stakes such as ValueAct\u2019s less than 1% stake in Microsoft in April 2013. That same year, Mr. Icahn took a similarly modest stake in Apple. In 2015, Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management accumulated a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric , then equal to roughly 1% of its market capitalization. On Valentine\u2019s Day 2017, Trian hearted Procter & Gamble with a roughly $3 billion stake in the then $225 billion company. A few months later, Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point took a stake in Nestl\u00e9 of roughly the same size. Elliott\u2019s AT&T bid falls into this category.\n\nA broad look over these past campaigns suggests that activists have mostly succeeded in being heard, but their effectiveness is less clear. After only a few months, ValueAct\u2019s Mason Morfit got a seat on Microsoft\u2019s board. Mr. Icahn\u2019s investment in Apple did well, but the company had begun buying back shares, as he urged, before his appearance. Mr. Peltz\u2019s stake in GE has been decidedly less successful. P&G , meanwhile, has only recently started to perform well.\n\nIt can\u2019t hurt to have someone keep a board accountable but, in aggregate, activists\u2019 presence isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. A paper published at the end of last year by researchers including David Larcker at Stanford University found that \u201cpre-to-post-activism long-term returns insignificantly differ from zero\u201d regarding shareholder wealth and the economy. Hedge Fund Research\u2019s Activist Index has underperformed the S&P 500 every year for the past six years and its total return since 2008 has been just 31%.\n\nInvestors can more easily hold activists accountable if they go for both size and presence. Relative no-namers Abrams Capital, Knighthead Capital and Redwood Capital bought a roughly 10% combined stake in PG&E in mid-January when the California utility announced its plans to file for bankruptcy. They have helped replace the CEO and board members, appointing mainly industry experts.\n\nElliott has its work cut out at AT&T. The stock had been a relative underperformer, but has returned around 30% year-to-date following a lengthy battle to buy Time Warner. Elliott\u2019s suggestions, including hiving off DirecTV, could prove difficult. And in making John Stankey the heir apparent for AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, the company has its own plan for succession under way. Elliott\u2019s presence could prove a distraction at a difficult time.\n\nThe company might partially acquiesce to Elliott without undoing Mr. Stephenson\u2019s legacy. Investors could rightly ask, though, whether the intervention made much of a difference.\n\nWrite to Lauren Silva Laughlin at lauren.silvalaughlin@wsj.com", "description": "The phenomenon of cantankerous shareholders staking their claim on very large companies with ever smaller interests has grown, but in many cases it isn\u2019t clear if companies would have taken decisions on their own accord.", "authors": ["Lauren Silva Laughlin", "Lauren.Silvalaughlin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107303/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
