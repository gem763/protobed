Along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, it is considered one of the three states Trump narrowly won in 2016 that he must win in 2020 to be re-elected.\n\nThe poll was conducted between October 13 and October 17, and has a margin of error of 4.2 percent.\n\nA mere majority vote in the House is required to impeach the president. Impeachment in the House then moves the matter to the Senate, which, under the Constitution, is required to hold a trial on the articles of impeachment approved by the House. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required to convict and remove the president from office.\n\nThe New York Times Upshot/Siena College Poll of voters in six key battleground states\u2013all won by Trump in 2016\u2013shows impeachment and removal from office is unpopular in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona, as well as Wisconsin. By a ten point margin, 53 percent to 43 percent, voters in these six states oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president.\n\nThe poll also found a bare majority of respondents in those six states favor the initiation of House proceedings by a 50 percent to 45 percent margin.\n\nVoters in the states likeliest to decide the presidency support the House impeachment inquiry but still oppose impeaching the president and removing him from office https://t.co/vSiOJNLIwX pic.twitter.com/UdEj6gcNJ2 \u2014 Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) October 21, 2019\n\nThe poll of 1,934 registered voters in these six states was conducted between October 13 and October 20. Thirty two percent of respondents were Democrats, 29 percent were Republicans, and 37 percent were Independent/Other, according to the poll\u2019s cross tabs. The cross tabs did not provide a state-by-state breakdown of the respondents, and as an aggregation of sentiment across six states, it is uncertain how the results might vary in each specific state.\n\nThe current party breakdown in the House of Representatives is 197 Republicans, one Independent, 234 Democrats \u2013 one of whom, Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), announced her resignation on Sunday but has not yet named the effective date of that resignation \u2013 and three vacancies.\n\nThis means Speaker Pelosi needs 217 votes to ensure her resolution to initiate impeachment proceedings passes, if all 432 members eligible to vote cast their ballots and if Rep. Hill\u2019s effective resignation date is not until after Thursday\u2019s vote. In the event Hill\u2019s resignation becomes effective prior to Thursday\u2019s vote, the resolution will require 216 votes to pass, if all 431 members eligible to vote cast their ballots.\n\nWith or without Rep. Hill\u2019s vote, Democrats can afford as many as 18 defectors to secure the votes needed to pass the resolution in the event all 197 Republicans vote to oppose the resolution and the sole Independent, Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), votes in favor of it.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, the 31 Democrat members of the House of Representatives who represent districts President Trump won in 2016 are likely to come under intense pressure from Trump supporters in their districts to vote against the Pelosi impeachment resolution on Thursday.\n\nSix of these 31 Democrat members represent districts in these six key battleground states\u2013Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran (D-AZ), Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA), Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA), and Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI). Two of those six\u2013Lamb and Kind\u2013scored double digit victories in 2018.\n\nAccording to a head count of public statements about impeachment by House members, updated to October 22 by NPR, all but seven Democrats have publicly indicated their support for impeachment proceedings. Those seven Democrats yet to weigh in publicly are Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI), Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-SC) , Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ), Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-NY) , Rep. Kendra Horn (D-OK), and Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN).\n\nAll seven are among the 31 Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump in 2016.\n\nLate Tuesday, the first break in the wall of Democratic unity came when one of these seven Democrats, Rep. Van Drew (D-NJ) , announced that he would not support Thursday\u2019s impeachment resolution, as Alex Moe of NBC News tweeted:\n\n\u201cI would imagine that I\u2019m not voting for it,\u201d Dem @CongressmanJVD says about the impeachment process resolution the House will take up Thursday saying he hasn\u2019t been supportive of impeachment all along.\n\n\u2014 Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) October 29, 2019", "description": "Polls show the effort of Democrats to impeach and remove Trump from office is unpopular with voters in several key battleground states.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/donald-trump-Carolyn-KasterAP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
