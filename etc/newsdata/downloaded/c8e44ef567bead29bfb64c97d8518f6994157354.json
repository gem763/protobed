He did the first half in less than an hour and then he\u2019s done that just again.\u201d\n\nThe Prater Park in the Austrian capital offered long straights, protected from the wind by high trees, for most of the 9.6-kilometer course, which Kipchoge completed more than 4 times.\n\nIt was his second attempt at breaking the two-hour barrier, after missing out by 26 seconds at a similar event on the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, in May 2017.\n\nKipchoge, who took Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and has won 10 of his 11 marathons, holds the official world record of 2:01:39 since shattering the previous best mark by 78 seconds in Berlin last year.\n\nIn near-perfect circumstances at the meticulously planned attempt, Kipchoge shaved almost two minutes off that time.\n\nLong-time coach and mentor, Patrick Sang, a former Olympic and world steeplechase silver medalist, said it was \u201creally exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy for him and what he has achieved. He has inspired all of us that we can stretch out limits and that we can do more than we think we can do,\u201d Sang added.\n\nUnder Sang\u2019s guidance, Kipchoge won gold in the 5,000 meters at the world championship in 2003, the start of a distinguished track career.\n\nAfter missing out on qualification for the London Olympics on the track, Eliud switched to the marathon.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "VIENNA (AP) \u2014 Eliud Kipchoge has become the first athlete to run a marathon in less than two hours, although it will not count as a world record.
