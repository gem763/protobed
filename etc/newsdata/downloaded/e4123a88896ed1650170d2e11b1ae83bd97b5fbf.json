If a comparison has to be drawn between the two cuisines, it would be more precise to compare kimbap to Japanese maki - seaweed and rice rolls, rather than sushi in general. Kimbap is seaweed and rice rolled around vegetables and some type of protein. It is child-friendly food that adults enjoy, too. Because the rolls are sturdy and eaten out of hand, they are great for picnics or packed lunches.\n\nKimbap should be eaten fresh or at room temperature; refrigerating it makes the rice hard. If you want to prepare kimbap the night before and refrigerate it to eat the next day, the best way to heat it is by frying: dip the whole (uncut) rolls in beaten egg, then dredge in panko (Japanese bread crumbs, sold in bags). Fry the rolls in a skillet - this will soften the rice and add a crunchy texture. Cut the fried kimbap into bite-size pieces and pack them in a lunchbox or picnic container.\n\nLuncheon meat might not seem very \u201cfoodie\u201d but many of us grew up eating it, and still crave it occasionally. I like the Korean and Japanese brands of luncheon meat. For kimbap, be sure to buy the type that is in a rectangular can, rather than a round one.\n\nA bamboo sushi mat makes rolling the kimbap much easier. In addition to danmuji/takuan (Korean or Japanese semi-dried and pickled radish), carrot and cucumber \u2013 which seem to feature in all kimbap \u2013 you can also add spinach (blanch the leaves and squeeze out the moisture, then mix with a little sesame oil and salt), chopped kimchi (squeezed dry) and thin egg omelette; if you dislike luncheon meat, substitute cooked beef, pork (such as ham or char siu), surimi (fake crab legs), firm tofu (pan-fried) and even cheese. Kimbap-makers in Korea get pretty creative with the fillings, and you can, too.", "description": "Kimbap (also spelled gimbap) is often called \"Korean sushi\" but that isn't accurate.
