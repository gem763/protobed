Twice over.\"\n\nPeople on social media mocked Biden's reference to a record player:\n\nBiden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, responded to the viral moment with a self-deprecating joke on Twitter: \"Just so everyone knows - record players are really popular (we have one at home!)\"\n\nBusiness Insider is interested in hearing from voters who are following the 2020 Republican primary about questons they have for candidates.
