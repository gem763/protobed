We look forward to the next phase in our growth and development.\"\n\nAyre, Centbee, and nChain all share a passion for bitcoin SV, a variant on Bitcoin Cash (itself a fork of the original bitcoin) that they describe as the only blockchain that represents the original intention behind such tokens.\n\nThe price of bitcoin SV plummeted this week after major exchange Binance delisted it from trading amid a nasty dispute within the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin SV creator Craig Wright claims to also be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the original and much-revered creator of bitcoin. His claim is heavily disputed, complete with allegations of theft.\n\nThe bitcoin SV variant is so named because it supposedly represents \"Satoshi Vision\".\n\nWright has reportedly threatened critics with libel and harassment lawsuits, and has put out a bounty for the identity of one person he labels a troll.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Mobile wallet company Centbee, co-founded by a former eBucks CEO, announced it had closed a new round of funding just as bitcoin SV, the coin variant it backs, went into a slump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8762/67b09c66ef9041959daaf741f61d6d16.png", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
