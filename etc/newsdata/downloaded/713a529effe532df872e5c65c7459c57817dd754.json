(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) screams as his head is lit on fire. Former president Barack Obama is smashed face-first like a battering ram into what appears to be part of a wooden pulpit. People with their faces replaced by the logos of news organizations such as CNN, NBC, Politico and HuffPost are brutally stabbed and shot.\n\nAt the center of the bloody rampage unfolding in the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d is a man dressed in a dark pinstripe suit. President Trump\u2019s head is superimposed on his body.\n\nThe graphic images are from a fake video that was shown during a pro-Trump conference last week at the president\u2019s hotel and golf resort near Miami, according to the New York Times, which first reported on the video\u2019s existence Sunday night. The clip has since drawn intense backlash from journalists and public figures who have decried it as \u201cvile and horrific\u201d and an \u201cincitement of violence.\u201d Many of the news organizations and people featured in the video have been publicly targeted by Trump, who is frequently criticized for his inflammatory remarks and anti-media rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThis video isn\u2019t funny,\u201d tweeted former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cIt will get people killed.\u201d\n\nAt a conference of Trump supporters, they played a video of our president murdering journalists in a church. Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN\u2014and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed. https://t.co/XWtq1z38Kc \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video, adapted from the scene of a church massacre in the 2014 film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d appeared to be shared to YouTube in 2018 on a channel that posts similar pro-Trump content and has been linked to a meme-maker associated with a website called MemeWorld. The site\u2019s creator, a user known by his Internet handle, Carpe Donktum, scored an Oval Office meeting in July with Trump, who reportedly welcomed him as a \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Carpe Donktum confirmed in a Twitter message to The Washington Post that \u201cThe creator of the video is, and will remain a contributor to my site MemeWorld.\u201d Carpe Donktum declined to identify the video\u2019s creator citing concerns that the person may face online or in-person harassment.\n\nAlex Phillips, organizer of the American Priority Festival and Conference, told the Times that the video was played at one point during the three-day event that began Thursday as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d The violent parody was included in a meme compilation that also featured Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign logo, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19,\u201d a statement posted to the conference\u2019s website said. \u201cThis video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers.\u201d\n\nThe statement went on to note that the conference \u201calways has and always will condemn political violence.\u201d\n\nPhillips told the Times that the \u201cmatter is under review.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Post early Monday, the Trump campaign distanced itself from the video.\n\n\u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\u201d said campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.\n\nPeople close to Trump, such as former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., were also scheduled to speak at the conference and told the Times they were not aware of the edited clip. The White House did not respond to a request for comment late Sunday.\n\nThe video\u2019s massacre scene opens with the Trump figure walking down the center aisle of a packed church. More than a dozen of the parishioners\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\n\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\u2019s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\n\nThen, chaos ensues.\n\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \u201cFake News\u201d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\n\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\u2019s neck.\n\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors. He stabs actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell and repeatedly punches Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He goes on to shoot MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\n\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump puts a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo. A now-grinning Trump appears to survey the carnage as DJ Khaled\u2019s song, \u201cAll I Do Is Win,\u201d plays in the background. A pair of pixelated black sunglasses are lowered onto Trump\u2019s face.\n\nBy late Sunday, \u201cKingsman\u201d was trending on Twitter with many expressing outrage at the video and calling on Trump to condemn it.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2014 but it is by far and away the worst,\u201d CNN said in a statement shared on Twitter.\n\nThe images in the recent video are \u201cvile and horrific,\u201d CNN said, adding, \u201cThe President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\u201d\n\nWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Jonathan Karl of ABC News also denounced the video, noting that Trump has been warned that \u201chis rhetoric could incite violence.\u201d\n\nWHCA Statement on video depicting President Trump murdering journalists. pic.twitter.com/52lHFaQjU2 \u2014 WHCA (@whca) October 14, 2019\n\nKarl\u2019s statement was supported early Monday by Cindy McCain, who tweeted that the images in the video of the president killing the media and her late husband \u201cviolate every norm our society expects from its leaders.\u201d\n\nTrump has made it a habit to publicly lambaste the media, individual journalists and his critics, leading to heightened concerns about safety. In 2017, the president was widely criticized for tweeting a similarly edited video that showed him body slamming a person with a CNN logo for a face during a pro wrestling match. Last year, Cesar Sayoc, a devoted Trump supporter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 13 pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats, several of whom were featured in the recent video, and CNN.\n\nOn Sunday, horrified journalists and political commentators suggested that the church video is further evidence that Trump\u2019s words have influenced his supporters.\n\n\u201cThis is an incitement to violence that didn\u2019t just come from the dark corners of the Internet \u2014 it was shown at a pro-Trump conference at one of his resorts,\u201d tweeted Andrew Desiderio, a congressional reporter with Politico. \u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d\n\nCNN commentator Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas wrote, \u201cTrump has legitimized hate.\u201d\n\nEnablers choose to deny it, but this is the kind of crap Trump peddles & inspires. His constant attacks on the free press, the chants against journalists at his rallies, his retweeting of similar memes...Trump has legitimized hate. #Deplorable https://t.co/vqk0w9Kd9n \u2014 Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas (@ananavarro) October 14, 2019\n\nA year ago this month a man mailed bombs to journalists, Democratic leaders, and critics of Donald Trump. He was responding to Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric. Now we\u2019ve got videos of mass slaughters.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s literally no telling what kind of dangers they could unleash. \u2014 Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) October 14, 2019\n\nCall someone an \"enemy\" over and over again, and you have some responsibility for what happens to them.\n\n\n\nTrump is responsible for a climate that is so hateful, so hostile toward journalists that it spawns videos like this one. https://t.co/mn1W8W69M1 \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 14, 2019\n\nActress Kathy Griffin, who drew widespread backlash in 2017 after sharing a photo of herself holding a prop of Trump\u2019s bloody severed head, echoed concerns about the clip\u2019s impact. Griffin, shown in the video getting beheaded by the ax-wielding CNN person, tweeted that it \u201cisn\u2019t a joke\u201d to Trump supporters, adding, \u201cAnd it will not be taken as such.\"\n\nOthers wondered if the video represents, as one person put it, \u201cthe country hitting rock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough mass shootings, we have enough journalists killed in the line of duty around the world \u2014 we don\u2019t need to glorify a massacre of people who challenge Trump,\u201d Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted. \u201cThis demonization of opponents and fetishization of violence is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nPres Trump, VP Pence and members of Congress, please speak up about a Trumpian video that presents a massacre of journalists and members of Congress (including Sen. McCain) as a heroic act. It's an embarrassment for our country and could encourage a mass shooter. Disgraceful. \u2014 Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) October 14, 2019\n\nBut some pushed back against criticisms of the video, pointing out that the film\u2019s original scene, which depicted a church full of \u201cconservative Christians\u201d being killed, did not draw the same level of backlash. According to an NPR review of the movie, the congregation was \u201cclearly modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church,\u201d a Kansas-based organization known for its anti-gay views.\n\nTrump has yet to address the video, but several people theorized that the president, who is known to share memes, would tweet it himself.", "description": "\u201cThis video isn\u2019t funny.
