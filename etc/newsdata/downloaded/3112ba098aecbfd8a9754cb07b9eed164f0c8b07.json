Williams is a full-time special-education classroom assistant, or SECA, working mostly with medically fragile students. \u201cI get them to the restroom if they can\u2019t utilize the restrooms themselves. I would say that within the population I serve, around 80 percent we have to assist with the restroom,\u201d he told New York. \u201cWhen it comes down to learning, if they can\u2019t physically move their head or physically move their hands, we have to make sure that we modify the proper tools that they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my job. I love my students. You come to work every day and you expect something different every day. You understand what it really means for a person to be depended upon,\u201d he explained. But Williams, a member of SEIU Local 73, walked out on strike this Thursday. Though Williams, and SECAs in general, are essential to special-education classrooms, he told New York that he makes only around $39,000 a year. His salary must support three children and a wife with multiple sclerosis. The task would be impossible, he said, if the family didn\u2019t rent out a four-unit building for supplemental income. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for my other peers, who don\u2019t have that option or who don\u2019t have the support to purchase real estate or have something other than the job that\u2019s taking up their whole day,\u201d he added. Other SECAs work two or even three jobs to keep themselves and their families afloat.\n\nSEIU Local 73, which represents school support staff like bus aides, custodians, and SECAs, says its members are among the lowest-paid public workers in the city. But their grievances aren\u2019t anomalies. When 7,500 of its members gathered on picket lines this Thursday, they weren\u2019t alone. Members of the Chicago Teachers Union also walked out on strike this morning. Combined, the striking workers number over 32,000.\n\nAndre Henry, Special Education Classroom Asst, talks with @WGNNews about why he is striking at his school, Christopher Elementary for #GoodJobs4Chicago! pic.twitter.com/w9afAat0TR \u2014 SEIU Local 73 (@SEIU73) October 17, 2019\n\nFor Lori Lightfoot, the city\u2019s new mayor and a Democrat, a dual strike is a nightmarish scenario. A strike by CTU alone would have been among the city\u2019s biggest since 2012. At that time, the union stayed out on strike for a week, protesting low pay, unwieldy class sizes, and the policies of then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, an ally of the charter-school movement. If the teachers\u2019-strike wave that erupted in West Virginia and spread across the nation had a discernible and singular root, it\u2019s probably Chicago and the strike of 2012. But a dual strike, coordinated by two of the city\u2019s most powerful public-sector unions, has no precedent. Not only will it temporarily close the city\u2019s public-school system; it undermines a promise central to Lightfoot\u2019s mayoral campaign.\n\nLightfoot ran as the progressive antidote to the policies of Emanuel and Mayor Richard Daley before him. She pledged to clean up corruption, rein in the city\u2019s violent police department, and work amicably with CTU, and while that wasn\u2019t enough to win the powerful union\u2019s endorsement, teachers told New York that some members supported her campaign anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not Rahm,\u201d the new mayor told the union last September.\n\nThanks in part to CTU and SEIU Local 73, Lightfoot\u2019s progressive credentials now look less robust. SEIU says its members currently make poverty wages, and, in a statement, the union slammed Lightfoot for missing a chance to \u201cfulfill her campaign promises to bring educational equity to Chicago students and bring economic justice to the workers who work in the Chicago Public Schools.\u201d CTU, citing the city\u2019s high cost of living and an estimated 16,000 homeless students, wants its new contract to address fair housing. The union has asked for a ban on evictions during the school year, housing assistance for teachers, and, according to Labor Notes, new funding to help homeless students and families. Other city workers already receive housing assistance. Nevertheless, Lightfoot publicly criticized the union for incorporating fair housing in its demands, on the grounds that a labor contract is not an \u201cappropriate place for the city to legislate its affordable-housing policy.\u201d In a statement released on Wednesday, CTU president Jesse Sharkey blamed the mayor for the stalled negotiations. \u201cMayor Lightfoot has the power to ensure that the equity and justice she promised our students as a candidate becomes the norm and not the exception in our schools \u2014 yet she\u2019s failed to bring those values to the bargaining table,\u201d Sharkey said. Lightfoot, in other words, has yet to persuade either union that she is truly serious about making Chicago a more egalitarian city.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s labor troubles are part of a broader challenge for the mayor. Her most recent predecessors, Emanuel and Daley, slashed funding for the city\u2019s public services. During his time as mayor, Emanuel closed dozens of public schools, most of them located in predominantly black and brown neighborhoods. He antagonized teachers further by expanding the number of privately operated charter schools in the city. Daley too closed a number of public schools and consolidated others, citing budgetary constraints and poor performance as his rationale. But the policy, designed by Arne Duncan before he became Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of Education, did almost nothing to improve the school system\u2019s overall academic performance. Lightfoot inherited an unenviable situation from both men and so did her constituents. Decades of austerity have stripped the city\u2019s public services to their bones.\n\nIf CTU\u2019s grievances sound familiar, austerity may also help explain the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The union is still asking for higher pay, smaller class sizes, and better wraparound resources \u2014 like school nurses, social workers, and librarians \u2014 because schools still have needs the city hasn\u2019t met. \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for is really necessary to give Chicago students the schools they deserve,\u201d said Rebecca Reddicliffe, who teaches second grade at Chavez Elementary School. \u201cI think every child deserves a nurse in their school, and I think that we need more social workers and counselors for students. We don\u2019t come anywhere close to the suggested ratio, and I think that that is an injustice.\u201d CPS has made some progress in reducing overcrowding, but at many schools, average class sizes still exceed the city\u2019s recommended caps. CTU says a quarter of the city\u2019s elementary-school students learn in overcrowded classrooms; that figure jumps to 35 percent for high-school students. One math teacher told a local CBS affiliate that her classes range from 32 to 37 students. The union also says the district has a nursing shortage, and parents themselves have complained that students often receive uneven and inadequate medical care at school.\n\nConsider CTU\u2019s demands alongside those put forward by SEIU Local 73 and the strategy behind Thursday\u2019s strike becomes clear. Both SEIU Local 73 and CTU represent workers charged with making sure public spaces remain truly public, that the city\u2019s schools provide enrichment for everyone. In this way, their members carry on a fight that teachers launched in 2012. \u201cIn 2012, it was much larger than conventional aspects of bargaining, where you talk about a number of workplace-related issues,\u201d explained Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the co-author of a book on the 2012 teachers\u2019 strike, A Fight for the Soul of Public Education. \u201cThe subsequent strike was about the defense and empowerment of the role of public institutions, in this case, public education.\u201d\n\nBruno and his co-author, Steven Ashby, concluded that the strike had worked. \u201cSome of the bigger and more systemic changes that the teachers wanted to bring, they didn\u2019t accomplish in 2012,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cBut the reason why 2012 is so important is that this is when you first see the teachers union reconceptualize how it\u2019s going to use the collective-bargaining process. Now it\u2019s going to be used to lead a social movement, and it\u2019s going to be to bring about some larger public good. We really want to have a say in changing the way schools are organized and governed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey probably got more of those bigger changes in 2016 than they did in 2012,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was in 2012 that they really put these issues front and center in the dispute.\u201d CTU owes its evolution into a more militant \u2014 and successful \u2014 union to the internal organizing efforts of the union\u2019s left-wing Caucus of Rank and File Educators; both Sharkey, the union\u2019s current president, and his predecessor, Karen Lewis, belong to CORE. Their broad emphasis on systemic inequality is visible in each of the union\u2019s major victories. The 2012 strike warded off an Emanuel proposal to link teacher pay to merit, the Chicago Tribune reported at the time, in addition to pay raises and assurances that laid-off teachers have hiring preference within the district. In 2016, after a one-day walkout, the union won funding for the creation of 55 community schools, publicly run institutions that provide GED courses and some health services in addition to regular K\u201312 education.\n\nAs the public sphere contracted, the private sphere flourished. Workers and low-income city residents, meanwhile, haven\u2019t fared so well. Charter schools are still a major union grievance, but there are other sources of tension: CTU has long criticized the Chicago Public Schools for outsourcing some wraparound services, like counseling and nursing, to private contractors; the school system is \u201ccutting corners with private contracts, which fail to save money and have serious health impacts on kids,\u201d the union said in a report quoted by the Chicago Tribune. In its own press releases, SEIU Local 73 singles out two large corporations, Sodexo and Aramark, as examples of privatization gone wrong. Since at least 2014, both companies have received tens of millions of dollars to manage the city\u2019s school custodians, many of them unionized. But buildings are frequently filthy, a trend the union blames on private contractors. Children tend to be messy, for instance, but SEIU says Sodexo and Aramark often give custodians Swiffer Jets instead of mops to clean up vomit and diarrhea. That\u2019s a health hazard, and it isn\u2019t just dangerous for students. Chicago\u2019s austerity regime rests on the backs of public workers, many of them low income and vulnerable themselves.\n\n\u201cThese are workers that are mostly black and brown, and they\u2019re mostly women,\u201d explained Dian Palmer, the president of SEIU 73. \u201cA lot of them are heads of households that support their families and themselves in the district.\u201d Unlike Jonathan Williams, most work part time. According to SEIU, the city often schedules them for less than 28 hours per week so workers aren\u2019t eligible for health insurance. Wages are typically low. Larry Alcoff, the union\u2019s lead negotiator with the city, said that unless they pick up additional work, the city\u2019s bus aides make around $16,000 to $22,000 per school year. \u201cWe have stories of people who ended up living in their car for three months over the summer when they weren\u2019t getting a paycheck,\u201d he said. CTU members generally receive higher pay, but the city\u2019s high cost of living makes wages a priority for members of both unions. Though CTU\u2019s demands for affordable housing are distinct from those put forward by SEIU 73, the unions share a common enemy. They\u2019re striking against austerity.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s election isn\u2019t the only evidence that change is coming to Chicago. Several democratic socialists now serve on the city council, which gives unions a reliable base of support and adds some pressure on Lightfoot. Charter schools still abound, but many charter educators are now unionized, and they\u2019ve complained of low pay and overcrowding in their own workplaces. Last December, CTU launched the nation\u2019s first-ever charter-school strike, which earned teachers at Acero schools better pay, smaller class sizes, a shortened workday more in line with standards at traditional city public schools. If the city hoped the charter schools would weaken CTU\u2019s growing power, they were wrong. Another charter strike looms: Teachers at the Passages school have authorized a strike for October 22. By linking up with SEIU Local 73, the city\u2019s teachers have thrown down the gauntlet. The strike is a fight for the city\u2019s public future.\n\n\u201cI think the mayor should really understand what and why we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for a transformative contract.\u201d", "description": "The outcome of a new teachers\u2019 strike in Chicago will help decide the future of the city\u2019s public services.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/17/17-chicago-teachers-strike.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
