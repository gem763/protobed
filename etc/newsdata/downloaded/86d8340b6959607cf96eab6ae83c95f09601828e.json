Customers in Australia, New Zeeland, Kazahstan, Armenia, or other countries where the ISP has a presence, were not impacted.\n\nBeeline has more than 50 million subscribers in Russia but said that only 3 million are broadband customers, with the bulk being mobile subscribers.\n\nKommersant said it learned of the breach from a source in the banking security sector. The data was being shared online, including on Telegram channels.\n\nThis is the second major data breach impacting a Russian company the newspaper reported this month.
