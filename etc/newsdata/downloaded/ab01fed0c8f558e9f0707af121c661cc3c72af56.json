This is a final, I\u2019m really privileged to be here in the first place, so keep fighting.\u201d\n\nOsaka was in control now and broke Barty \u2014 who five years ago took a rest from tennis and played cricket \u2014 in the first game of the deciding set on the way to victory.\n\nThis was a third title of 2019 for Osaka and fifth in her short career.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Naomi Osaka won a second tournament on the spin as she fought back from a set down to defeat world number one Ashleigh Barty in the China Open final on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/21911626-1040x572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
