If so, he is part of a history that stretches from Caravaggio to Kahlo\n\nAnthony van Dyck\u2019s portrait of Isabella Brant \u2013 the wife of his mentor, Rubens \u2013 is usually seen as a homage to the painter who helped him on his way. But a new interpretation by the Cambridge academic John Harvey suggests that Van Dyck was actually Brant\u2019s lover \u2013 and her wry smile in the portrait is a coded brag. If so, it is part of a long tradition of sexual secrets hidden in art. Spotting the love story is a game that still teases us centuries later.\n\nIn the 1600s, an English traveller in Rome was shown Caravaggio\u2019s Amor Vincit Omnia \u2013 in which a naked Cupid looks with a sneering smile from the wreckage of culture \u2013 and was told it portrays \u201cCaravaggio\u2019s boy, that laid with him\u201d. This youth was called Cecco, and appears in other paintings by Caravaggio. He is Isaac about to be killed by his father, and a nude Saint John the Baptist. Caravaggio taught him, as well as laying with him, and he became an artist in his own right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Detail from Lady Hamilton as a Bacchante by \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun.

When he portrayed Cecco as John the Baptist, he was following Leonardo da Vinci, whose pupil Sala\u00ec was the most likely model for his semi-nude Baptist. This painting\u2019s private meaning is teased out in a drawing by Leonardo that gives Saint John an erection.\n\nIn the 1460s, Filippo Lippi portrayed his lover Lucrezia as the Madonna, looking tenderly at a Christ who is probably their baby son. This may seem only mildly profane \u2013 except that Lippi was a friar and when he met Lucrezia she was a nun. He invited her to pose for a painting in her convent, then ran off with her.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Judith with the head of Holofernes \u2013 the severed head is Cristofano Allori\u2019s own.

Connoisseurs enjoyed showing off that they knew the hidden meaning of Cristofano Allori\u2019s Judith and Holofernes, in which a pale Judith in a sumptuous dress holds the severed head of a man. Contemporaries in the 1600s gossiped that Judith is Allori\u2019s cruel mistress, Maria de Giovanni Mazzafirri. The severed head is, of course, his own. For good measure, Judith\u2019s servant is Mazzafirri\u2019s mother whom he blamed for wrecking their relationship.\n\nMaybe \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was one of the many people who fell for Emma Hamilton, the wife of the British ambassador to Naples and mistress of Nelson. This aristocratic artist and close friend of Marie Antoinette portrayed Hamilton four times, including in the nude. Her portraits capture the sexuality that seduced Nelson much more powerfully than any paintings by men.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Filippo Lippi portrayed his lover Lucrezia as the Madonna.

He even paid homage to the Renaissance cult of the art of love in a series of engravings of Raphael and his mistress La Fornarina. But in his violently carnal masterpiece, The Three Dancers, he tells a story of love gone wrong. Two of the figures represent his friends Ramon Pichot and his wife, Germaine Gargallo. The third is believed to be his youthful friend (and Gargallo\u2019s lover) Carlos Casagemas, who killed himself over Gargallo. Frida Kahlo was just as painfully confessional: in her 1943 Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, she has the face of her difficult love Diego Rivera tattooed on her forehead.\n\nIf Van Dyck hid his affair with Isabella in her portrait, it is just one among many passionate stories hidden in the world\u2019s greatest art.", "description": "It has been suggested that a portrait by the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck hides a secret about his love life.
