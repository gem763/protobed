(AP Photo/Noah K. Murray)\n\nWOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The pilot who was left dead after his small plane crashed and exploded Tuesday in a neighborhood in the New Jersey suburbs of New York City was in touch with air traffic control until suddenly losing contact, federal investigators said at the scene of the wreck.\n\nThe wreck left two houses ablaze, though no one in the homes was injured, when the Cessna 414 went down not far from an elementary school about 11 a.m., according to National Transportation Safety Board investigator Adam Gerhardt.\n\nThe crash sent flames into the air, belched smoke for hours and left neighbors thinking the earth was shaking.\n\nSteven Smith lives around the corner from the crash site. He said he heard a plane coming in low as if it was diving.\n\n\"Then there was a real short pause for about two seconds. Then there was a massive boom that shook my whole house,\" Smith said.\n\nGerhardt said the wreckage could take up to three days to clear from the house, whose second story the plane had nearly shorn off before becoming embedded inside.\n\nThe flight left Leesburg, Virginia, with only the pilot aboard, before 10 a.m., authorities said. The pilot was cleared to land at the Linden Airport, roughly 4 miles from the crash, but he suddenly lost contact with the controllers, according to Gerhardt.\n\nGerdardt said the pilot was flying using flight rules typically seen among experienced pilots.\n\nNo one was in the home where the plane dropped but flames spread to another house, where a woman escaped injury, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac said.\n\nGerhardt said a third home was also affected.\n\nJerry Bartolino, a retired teacher, was at home three houses away when the plane went down. He heard a thundering crash and felt the ground shake, he said.\n\nBartolino heard someone screaming, \"Oh my God,\" and ran outside to see flames shooting up from the house, he said.\n\nGeorge Brown, another neighbor, told WCBS he saw flames from where the plane went down.\n\n\"It kind of looks like a volcano erupted,\" he said.\n\nThe wreckage, and presumably the pilot, remained lodged in the basement of the house the plane hit, authorities said.\n\nThe weather in the area was cloudy and misty at the time of the crash.\n\nThe fires have been brought under control, the mayor said.\n\nThe neighborhood of well-kept, one- and two-story houses is nestled between a golf course and an elementary school, and not far from a New Jersey Transit rail line.\n\nThe NTSB's final report on the crash could take up to two years to complete.", "description": "The pilot who was left dead after his small plane crashed and exploded Tuesday in a neighborhood in the New Jersey suburbs of New York City was in touch with air traffic control until suddenly losing contact, federal investigators said at the scene of the wreck.
