Extinction Rebellion (XR) said other protesters had glued themselves to the building.\n\nIt said activists were calling on the government to explain its plan to meet its net-zero emissions target within the carbon budget of the UK.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gail Bradbrook kneels on top of the doorway into the Department for Transport in central London on Tuesday morning.

The international rebellion continues.\u201d\n\nQ&A What are Extinction Rebellion's key demands? Show Hide The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truth\n\nThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, \u201cworking with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change\u201d. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025\n\nThe UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens\u2019 assembly\n\nThe government must create a citizens\u2019 assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens\u2019 assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: \u201cA just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.\u201d Matthew Taylor\n\nOn Twitter, XR\u2019s London branch labelled the clearing of protesters from the square \u201can outrage\u201d. It also tweeted: \u201cToday, an unprecedented, political, decision has been taken to shut down peaceful protest calling out the government for inaction in the face of crisis.\u201d\n\nAs of 5pm on Monday, police said there had been 1,445 arrests in connection with the eight days of XR protests in London.\n\nThe deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said conditions were being imposed on protesters because of continued breaches of previous police orders and \u201congoing serious disruption to the community\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activity at sites across central London over this past week. Officers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters\u2019 tents in Trafalgar Square on Monday.

She said: \u201cI\u2019m refusing to leave and I\u2019ve glued myself to the ground. My husband has taken away the tent. The police haven\u2019t got it. I shall stay here until I\u2019m arrested.\u201d\n\nEllie Chowns, a Green party MEP, said she had been arrested after \u201cstanding in solidarity\u201d with protesters in Trafalgar Square.\n\nAt 11.30pm, about 50 protesters remained in the square and the majority of the activists\u2019 infrastructure had been removed.\n\nActivists had previously said they planned to launch \u201cXR Grandparents\u201d, an initiative focused on older generations, on Tuesday afternoon.", "description": "Actions continue after Met police order end to protests across the capital", "authors": ["Pa Media", "Richard Vize"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52398cc3042f5ab399e7b4db7bbd24280d24303/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=030f8218779d52b144d0fca54bff81a2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
