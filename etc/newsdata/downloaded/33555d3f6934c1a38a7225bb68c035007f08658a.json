It made me feel sad, horrified.\u2026 The same fate awaits me too, and Oddball, and the Deer outside; one day we shall all be nothing more than corpses.\u201d She doesn\u2019t bother to eulogize him. He was a poacher, a crime that\u2019s truly monstrous in her view. \u201cThe forest nurtured this little goblin,\u201d she says, but he did not respect it. Instead, \u201che treated the forest like his own personal farm.\u201d Only when she notices evidence of another death does she become truly upset. She spots the head of a deer in Big Foot\u2019s kitchen\u2014severed, the rest of its body butchered and eaten. At Big Foot\u2019s house, the death that she registers as a crime isn\u2019t his but the animal\u2019s: \u201cOne creature had devoured another, in the silence and the stillness of the Night.\u201d\n\nA deadly spring comes to the plateau. Janina senses \u201ca feverish vibration under the grass \u2026 as if vast, underground nerves, swollen with effort, were just about to burst.\u201d After the poacher\u2019s death, a local hunter is found dead, his body surrounded by hoofprints. Janina has a theory\u2014that wild animals are taking their revenge on those who hunt them. A businessman goes missing from town, and some say he has just run off with his mistress, as he\u2019s done in the past. But with a cataloging of his business interests\u2014a delicatessen, fox farm, slaughterhouse, and meat-processing plant\u2014his fate seems all but sealed. The police laugh at Janina\u2019s theory, but her neighbors, returning with the warm weather, don\u2019t. It seems right enough to the dentist, who says, \u201cThere has to be some justice, doesn\u2019t there? Yes, yes. Animals.\u201d\n\nJanina and her strange plateau exist on the edge of the magical and the real. The people in town all have the same teeth\u2014long, tinted bluish. A quirk of the minerals in the drinking water, or of genetics? A forester has wolf eyes, with oblong pupils. A stranger is seen in the forest and doesn\u2019t come out at night. If a satyr or a centaur were to appear among the trees, it wouldn\u2019t seem out of place. As the uncanny elements accrue, the description of Big Foot\u2019s actual feet\u2014with strange prehensile toes, covered in black hair\u2014which seemed like nothing at the time, looms large. Who\u2019s to say some frustrated herd of herbivores, peaceful by nature but pushed to the edge, hasn\u2019t banded together to commit some murders?\n\nBut the town is also just a town, with policemen who humor a silly old woman, up to a point, where some friends come visit and eat baked goods and talk about poetry, and the eeriness vanishes like a menacing shadow when the lamp turns on. One night, Janina and a couple of visitors sit drinking and talking. The conversation turns to personality\u2014why are some people prone to nastiness? The visitors list a host of reasons. Abuse, trauma, influences of television, maybe nutrient deficiencies. Janina insists on the influence of star signs, but it seems now like a flight of fancy. \u201c\u2018But it is Saturn,\u2019 I said, dying of laughter.\u201d In a moment of levity, with other people around, all creepiness evaporates.\n\nThis is the most special element of the book, the way it balances on the fence between genres\u2014there is suspense that comes from wanting to solve the murders, and then another layer of suspense hovering above that, that comes from wanting to know which type of book it will turn out you have been reading: a crime novel or a fairy tale.", "description": "The Nobel Prize\u2013winning novelist recasts our relationship with the environment.", "authors": ["Rachel Riederer"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7a6ebbb7d485fcb03b48ae85ff4d34665f6cf070.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
