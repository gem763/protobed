One one occasion Webb lay beside him on his bed and circled his nipples, telling him that's what he was to do with a girl.\n\nThat victim was in court to confront Webb, telling him he felt disgusted at being used for Webb's sick pleasure.\n\nHe said the abuse was under the guise of Webb teaching him what to do sexually with girls.\n\n\"It killed my confidence when I was actually with a girl,\" he said.\n\nThe victim said now when he thinks back to his otherwise happy childhood he can only think of \"a sweet little boy being groomed and trained\".\n\nThe memory of his elderly father crying as he revealed he had been \"preyed upon by a parasite\" would never leave him, he said.\n\nA second boy was abused by Webb in a car at a drive-in movie theatre.\n\nMr Smallwood said Webb had suffered a health condition which left him with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHe is also hearing impaired and cares for his vision-impaired wife and visits his 90-year-old father in aged care daily.\n\nJudge Mullaly said Webb was a vulnerable man and accepted prison would be onerous.\n\nHe warned he would be immediately jailed for the full two years if he reoffended in the next three years, adding for the sake of Webb's own moral compass he should never re-offend.\n\nWebb has been registered as a serious sex offender for life.", "description": "A serious sex offender has walked from court with a suspended sentence for abusing two young boys, amid fresh allegations involving three other...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
