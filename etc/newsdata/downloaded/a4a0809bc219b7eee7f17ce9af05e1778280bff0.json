His new movie Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) recounts that battle by leaving behind the old transgressive mischief of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s early up-from-underground films (Law of Desire, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) for a display of graceful sagacity.\n\nSalvador Mallo, a middle-aged Spanish filmmaker played by a sensitive, charmingly grizzled and gray-haired Antonio Banderas, is celebrated for his folk-punk audacity. The poster for Mallo\u2019s best-known film, Sabor (Taste), boasts a strawberried tongue sticking out of lubricious lips like the Rolling Stones logo. Mallo is from the counterculture generation, yet he has risen to respectability. Note that in Chinatown, John Huston averred, \u201cI\u2019m old. Politicians, public buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.\u201d Almod\u00f3var taunts that truism with Mallo\u2019s rebel tendency toward recreational drugs and lassitude whenever possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot simply autobiographical, this portrait of personal indulgence points toward honesty, benevolence, and forgiveness \u2014 virtues missing in most counterculture egoists who look back on the indiscretions of their halcyon past as merit badges. Mallo remembers the people who graced his life and agitated it: old lovers, first desires, a sacrificial mother who becomes judgmental. He also confronts his own vain egotism. (The title must nod to John Boorman\u2019s Hope and Glory. If so, then an Almod\u00f3var version of Boorman\u2019s follow-up, Queen and Country, will be exquisite.)\n\nWith Pain and Glory, Almod\u00f3var has made a self-critical film in an era lacking self-awareness. No wonder some critics dismiss it as \u201csoft.\u201d They never understood Almod\u00f3var\u2019s bemused permissiveness. In 1987\u2019s Law of Desire, it was buoyantly humane. In that film, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s perspective on a promiscuous gay filmmaker, his transsexual sibling, and a psychopathic lover made the ingenious mix of sex farce and thriller joyful, not merely shocking. In the era of \u201csoft power,\u201d Almod\u00f3var\u2019s humanity avoids pushing a political agenda. In Pain and Glory, compassion and forgiveness are more important than any radical progressivism for understanding Mallo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPain and Glory dramatizes the battle of experience \u2014 of despair versus perseverance and triumph. Mallo keeps looking back, comparing fond memories with regret, while enduring the infirmities of aging. Some of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s funniest devices here detail the machinery of modern medicine \u2014 colorful clinical procedures shown as psychedelic wonders, proving Mallo\u2019s own tough resilience. These contrast with memories of growing up poor in exurban caves with his mother (first played sensuously by Penelope Cruz and later magnificently by Julieta Serrano, who was the wronged, vengeful housewife in Women on the Verge) and then achieving high-toned class and the appurtenances of sophistication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlways a rascal, Mallo is honest about his mediocrity and luck. He describes his Catholic upbringing as \u201cOn days when I suffer, I\u2019m only half an atheist.\u201d Yet his past recall and later life are full of blessings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmod\u00f3var does his finest filmmaking when young Mallo (Asier Flores) realizes the thrill of teaching a good-looking worker (C\u00e9sar Vicente) to write: Two innocent hands touch, and Almod\u00f3var imbues their innocence with ecstasy. Terence Davies would blush at the simple ecstatic image. Seeking relief, adult Mallo \u201cchases the dragon\u201d (smokes heroin) with Alberto (Asier Etxeandia), an actor-antagonist and amoral sensualist who is hip to his tricks. And, in the film\u2019s finest, existential moment, Mallo encounters an old flame, Federico (Leonardo Sbaraglia).\n\nThe face-to-face, mirror-like image of romantic Federico and reckless Mallo defines the essence of homosexual attraction, something even Almod\u00f3var\u2019s hero-genius Jean Cocteau barely did. All these performances (Pain and Glory is the best-acted film of year) idealize complicated human relations. Cinematographer Jos\u00e9 Luis Alcaine presents Almod\u00f3var\u2019s vision with pellucid imagery. The clarity of the film\u2019s lighting sees life experience with depth and beneficence. Almod\u00f3var and Alcaine admit to cinematic make-believe and soulful confession, and then achieve pure visualized emotion.", "description": "\"Pain and Glory\" dramatizes the battle of experience \u2014 of despair versus perseverance and triumph.
