Scientists have just created the world\u2019s first long-cycle Li-Carbon Dioxide battery, and in a market-shredding first: it\u2019s fully rechargeable.\n\nThe hunt for advanced materials that will catapult battery technology to another level started decades ago. The search has been furious and diligent as researchers and scientists try to give the $90+ billion market exactly what it wants. And the market is set to reach this $92.2 billion as soon as 2024\u2014up from $37.4 billion in 2018.\n\nThe lucrative prospects for the lithium ion market has enticed what had been furious and diligent progress and transformed it into something that now has reached a fever pitch\u2014everyone wants in on the ground floor of the market that has nowhere to go but up.\n\nThe deliciousness of the lithium battery market is demonstrated by Tesla\u2019s push to constantly improve its current battery tech, the latest development of which prompted Tesla to quietly acquire Canadian Hibar Systems, a battery manufacturing and engineering company. Hibar has now gone dark and deep-sixed its website. We don\u2019t know what Tesla and Hibar have cooking, but you can bet it\u2019s big. All battery tech is precious, and developers are keeping their battery babies close to their vest, with everyone holding onto hope that it will be the next lucky soul to discover the next lithium battery upend-er.\n\nUp until now, this dedication to upend the battery market has occasionally and intermittently inspired some crazy techno-wizardry, producing gadgets with a grandiose and impossibly futuristic slant from breathable nanochain structures to bendable batteries that mimic the human spine.\n\nAnd now \u2026 researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have earned their stripes in the field after unveiling the world\u2019s first fully rechargeable lithium-carbon dioxide batteries that are seven times more efficient that conventional Li-ion types\u2014fully rechargeable being the operative phrase here.\n\nRelated: Greta Thunberg\u2019s Not-So-Little Carbon Footprint\n\nThe big news: the novel batteries can be recharged up to 500 times.\n\nBut there is more. These batteries are being billed as carbon-neutral. And as such, they can put a dent on the carbon levels in our atmosphere, ticking another box that the shifting landscape requires\u2014the environmentally friendly checkbox. They actually can capture carbon dioxide from power plants and factory exhaust, offering yet another market for the carbon dioxide batteries. Who doesn\u2019t love a good way to reduce carbon dioxide from our atmosphere?\n\nFor many years, scientists have salivated at the prospects of finding a material that could significantly extend the life of Li-ion batteries and allow them to last longer between charges. Now, researchers have discovered that lithium-carbon dioxide batteries fit the bill beautifully, since they possess up to 7x higher energy density than the common Li-ion batteries.\n\nBut one little problem has been dogging them, though: they just couldn\u2019t figure out how to make them last beyond a few charge cycles.\n\nUntil now.\n\nOnly last year, researchers at MIT demonstrated a prototype that lasted a grand total of 10 charge cycles. At the time it was an important breakthrough that solved one of the problems in the market. It was a game-changer, even though it didn\u2019t provide enough efficiency.\n\nBut now that\u2019s about to change. The newer version by the University of Illinois is an even bigger step-up in terms of the shellacking it can take in the form of charge cycles before giving up the ghost.\n\nThe technical cul de sac that the researchers have overcome revolves around a tendency of carbon buildup on the catalyst during charging.\n\nHow it works\n\nSo, how does this new wonder gadget work?\n\nAccording to Amin Salehi-Khojin, associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at UIC's College of Engineering and author of the paper, lithium-carbon dioxide batteries have been plagued by the accumulation of carbon, which not only blocks the active sites of the catalyst but also prevents efficient diffusion of carbon dioxide and triggers electrolyte decomposition in a charged state.", "description": "Scientists have just created the world\u2019s first long-cycle Li-Carbon Dioxide battery, and in a market-shredding first: it\u2019s fully rechargeable", "authors": ["Julianne Geiger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E018y_a5zCkzhp3RWUrhdA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/9167f61e38c2ef2b37915e5bb64c4c37", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
