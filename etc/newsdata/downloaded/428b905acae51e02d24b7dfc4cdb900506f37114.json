However, were a criminal investigation to be opened into Johnson, it could potentially make the prime minister's position untenable.\n\nThe Charlotte Edwardes scandal\n\nReuters\n\nOn Sunday journalist Charlotte Edwardes wrote a piece alleging that Johnson had groped both herself and another woman at a lunch hosted by the Spectator magazine, which Johnson was at the time the editor.\n\n\"Under the table, I feel Johnson's hand on my thigh,\" Edwardes wrote.\n\n\"He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\n\n\"My mother always said: 'Wear a badge to the cinema with which to stab the wandering hands.' But this is work, so I am silent.\"\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson denies groping journalist Charlotte Edwardes' thigh while editor of the Spectator\n\nEdwardes claims that after the incident another woman present at the lunch told her that Johnson had done the same to her.\n\nA spokesperson for Johnson on Monday denied that Johnson had groped Edwardes.\n\n\"This allegation is untrue,\" the spokesperson said, while refusing to take any further questions on the story.\n\nHowever, Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday backed Edwardes, telling Channel 4 News: \"I know Charlotte well, and I entirely trust what she has to say.\"\n\nFollowing Johnson's denial Edwardes tweeted: \"If the prime minister doesn't recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\"\n\nTaken in isolation, and given Johnson's outright denial, Edwardes' claims are unlikely to immediately threaten his position.\n\nHowever, if any other women were to come forward with similar allegations then the prime minister could be in serious political trouble.", "description": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under intense scrutiny following a series of allegations about his private life and use of public funds.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2d8f8da17d6c576531a507-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
