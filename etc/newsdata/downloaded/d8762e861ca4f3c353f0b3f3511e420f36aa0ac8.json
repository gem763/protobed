The critical bug has been issued a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 and a CVSS v2.0 base score of 10.0.\n\nSee also: D-Link to undergo security audits for 10 years as part of FTC settlement\n\nIn order to trigger the security flaw, Fortinet says attackers can perform a login action remotely that is poorly authenticated.\n\nThe bad authentication check allows code to execute whether or not a user has the privilege to do so, for a POST HTTP Request via PingTest to be sent, and for attackers to either grab administrator credentials or install a backdoor.\n\nThe security researchers disclosed their findings to D-Link on September 22. Within 24 hours the hardware vendor had confirmed the vulnerability, and three days later, D-Link said that as the products are at End of Life (EOL) support, no patch will be released.\n\nCNET: Renewed calls for backdoor access to encryption have all the same flaws\n\nGiven the age of these routers, it is not surprising that D-Link has chosen not to issue a fix. Our devices -- and their firmware -- all have an expiry date and eventually support does end, and therefore users of these routers should consider replacing their aging products to mitigate the risk of exploit.\n\nHowever, not every security-related decision D-Link has ever made can necessarily be considered reasonable.\n\nTechRepublic: How to create and export a GPG keypair on macOS\n\nIn related news, D-Link recently agreed to a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to lay to rest accusations of failing to tackle vulnerability reports and misrepresenting the security of its products.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the vendor will create a new security program for routers and Internet-connected products, and will also submit to security audits for the next ten years.\n\nZDNet has reached out to D-Link for comment and will update if we hear back.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
