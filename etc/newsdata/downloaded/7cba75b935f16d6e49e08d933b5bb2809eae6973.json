Architect Laura Jane Clark used some of the garage speace to move the staircase, creating a light-filled hallway that connected the entrance with the back of the house (right)\n\nThey were presented two designs from competing architects, Laura Jane Clark and Robert Jamison, who used virtual reality to give a sense of what the finished design could look like.\n\nThe two women were swept away by Laura's idea to open up the entrance of their house by moving the staircase to the left, thus creating a hallway, as were the show's viewers.\n\n'After thinking about it and looking at all the plans, looking at the pros and cons, we realised that Laura's was the best design for us to live in,' Lindsey said.\n\n'Laura's design felt like us, it just felt right,' agreed Ruth.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The couple's garage was cramped with children toys, bags, clothes, bikes and other types of clutter (left), but Lindsey did not want to get rid of it completely. Lindsey eventually changed her mind about the garage, which was turned into a utility room with plenty of storage (pictured: Lindsey showing the room to presenter Angela Scanlon)\n\nThe couple explained that they had spent all their savings on fertility treatments to make their dream of having children a reality. Two years later, the mothers to Aria and Ivy realised that their home was not ideal for navigating a pushchair.\n\nIndeed, in the entrance of the house, the main door opened to a tiny hallway and directly faced the stairs, which made it difficult to come in and out.\n\n'When we bought the house we overlooked how important an hallway is,' Lindsey admitted.\n\n'When you got a family and trailing in and out with a pram, it's not an ideal situation,' she added.\n\nThe hallway was one of the main reason why the couple went for Laura's design, because it offered a buggy space for their kids' pram and plenty of space to move around.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Lindsey and Ruth's tiny kitchen offered little storage space and only two cupboards for food items (left). They broke down all their walls to create an open plan kitchen that let the light in and had plenty of storage\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The living-room, kitchen and dining-room where all closed-off rooms, which was not practical for the couple, who wanted to keep an eye on their children while cooking (left). The three closed rooms where converted into a large living-space with the open plan kitchen, a dining room area and a sitting area on the side\n\nThe other main issue was that there was no way to get to the back of the house other than going through the main door, living-room and dining-room, which Laura's hallway design also took care of.\n\nDue to the lack of space, the cloakroom was located near the kitchen, meaning the couple had to cross their whole house to get rid of their clothes, bags and shoes.\n\n'You should come in and put your coat and your shoes in the cupboard,' Lindsey said.\n\n'As it is now, you have to trail through the living room and the kitchen to get to the cupboard,' she explained.\n\nThe room got plenty of light thanks to new, larger window and bifold doors. Lindsey and Ruth decorated with modern and homely items\n\nA lack of storage in their kitchen meant Lindsey and Ruth used their garage as a pantry, with pasta and rice next to the children's toys.\n\nLaura first decided to use a tiny bit of the garage space to move the staircase to the left of the house, thus creating a beautiful hallway connecting the entrance to the back of the house and garden.\n\nPresenter Angela Scanlon was impressed with the change.\n\n'Hard to imagine that you previously walked in here and were met, head on, with the set of stairs,' she said.\n\nShe also opened up the living room, kitchen and dining room to create a living-space with bi-fold windows, bringing in more natural light in the room.\n\nHer initial idea was to use the living space as a dining room and open kitchen.\n\nThe couple said they felt Laura's design fit them best. They wanted to make their space more practical around their children and family life\n\nWhile Lindsey and Ruth decided to trust the architect's vision, they used the rest of the space to create a living-room space next to the open kitchen, with a dining table in the middle, centered around a pillar.\n\nThey extended the space by 1.7m into the garden in order to gain some space.\n\nThey fitted a picture window by the kitchen so that they could get a full view of the garden while cooking.\n\nThe issue of storage was also resolved with sleek cupboards around the kitchen and in the entrance hallway, so that everyone could find what they needed with hassle.\n\nAnd, while Lyndsey was determined to keep the garage for fear of devaluing the house, the couple eventually decided to turn it into an utility room with a washing machine and dryer.\n\nIn order to obtain their dream house, Ruth and Lindsey forked out \u00a352,000, \u00a312,000 above their initial budget of \u00a340,000.\n\nViewers love Laura's design, as well as the changes Ruth and Lindsey decided on and applauded the transformation\n\nViewers fell in love with the house's new design.\n\n'Ruth and Lindsey's house is amazing now,' one wrote. 'What a transformation! New house builders take note!'\n\n'I really REALLY love this. REALLY B***** LOVE IT. It's gorgeous,' another wrote. 'Every little design and colour makes me happy.'\n\n'Wow, I just absolutely love LOVE the whole house design and finishing they have chosen. Just wow,' said another.", "description": "Lindsey and Ruth, who live in Teesside with their two young children, spent \u00a352,000 to renovate their house on BBC's 2 Your Home Made Perfect, after struggling with the lack of a proper hallway.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19831990-0-image-a-11_1571312601478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
