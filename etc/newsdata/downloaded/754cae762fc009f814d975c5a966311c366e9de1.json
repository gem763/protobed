They have their own dog bed, they sleep on the bed with me, my daughter has six.\u2019\n\nBut despite hanging out with 27 puppas, not everything is as it seems, as Claire went onto open up about the expense that goes into looking them.\n\n\u2018Rita Ora down there has just had her tail amputated, and that cost me \u00a3800,\u2019 she confessed.\n\nNot only that but the Diamond Dog that is David Bowie only has three legs and had to have physio treatment to start walking again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it seems her love for the pups has rubbed off on her neighbours \u2013 who all have rescue dogs of their own.\n\nThis Morning continues weekdays at 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
