May their souls rest in peace.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we are quite disturbed by these very unfortunate events and have taken actions and measures to address this issue and prevent their recurrence with the South African government,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said.\n\nHe again urged Nigerians to respect South African laws, to represent the country well and never to forget their roots.\n\nBuhari also called for \u201cthe few that sometimes give us a bad name, to desist from such misdemeanours and be good ambassadors\u201d.\n\n\u201cFirst, you are our ambassadors and the face of our country to the world wherever you are. The world is therefore, watching you and would make judgements on Nigeria based on your comportment and actions.\n\n\u201cSecond, in whatever legitimate engagement you find yourself, you must strive to excel and be the best,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cThird, while you are out in the Diaspora, do not forget home. You represent some of the best human assets that Nigeria has. With your education and exposure to the world, you are at the cutting edge of technology,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGauteng was hit by a spate of xenophobic violence last month with areas around Johannesburg and Pretoria being the most affected.\n\nThe conflict also spread to Nigeria, where citizens targeted South African businesses in retaliation.\n\nREAD: Buhari and Ramaphosa vow to end xenophobic violence for good\n\nAt least 12 people were killed and hundreds of migrant Nigerians were repatriated to their country.\n\nOn Friday, what was frustrating for Nigerians was that members of the APC SA were excluded from the talks.\n\nWhile discussions continued inside the hotel in Pretoria, Agbeniga and his colleagues waited outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling because we were all notified that there was a community meeting with the president this morning. We had to leave our workplaces to come here, so that we can voice our grievances to our president,\u201d Agbeniga said.\n\nHowever, the organisation would not be deterred by the exclusion as they would be taking further steps regarding the matter, he said.\n\nThe APC SA said it had a list with hundreds of names of Nigerians who should be compensated.\n\nAccordingly, they are expecting the Nigerian embassy to take the matter up with the South African government.\n\n\u201cThere are protocols, there are ways to handle things. The party is going to handle things officially. People have already handed in their names and the things they have lost in the process.\n\n\u201cSo we expect South Africa to follow up on that,\u201d said Agbeniga.\n\nHe distanced himself and the APC SA from the group of disgruntled Nigerians who protested outside the Union Buildings on Thursday.\n\nThe police fired tear gas to disperse the group and one person was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of it [the incident]. We do not know the grievances of those people,\u201d said Agbeniga. He believed the protest was used by the Nigerian embassy to sideline them.\n\n\u201cWhat we were told initially \u2013 we are the representatives of the ruling party in South Africa \u2013 this is APC SA, so we should be given priority. I am not happy personally and my people are not happy.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are living in fear in South Africa because no one knows what is going to happen next,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC SA chief whip sent a stern message to the Nigerian president: \u201cI want him [Buhari] to listen to the voice of the people.\n\n\u201cPeople are not happy about the situation in Nigeria, people are not happy about the situation here [in South Africa].\u201d", "description": "Nigerians living in South Africa aggrieved after being excluded from a meeting with their president which was supposed to talk compensation.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/74f2337511ca4174bd5e182041443192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
