It shows him leaving a massage parlor, and ABC's Trevor Ault is here with more. Trevor, what's going on? The new England patriots are notorious for hating distractions. Nobody lives that more than their star, Tom Brady. But this weekend he's taking questions about that appearance that he made off the field in Hollywood and he's really not happy about it. Reporter: This morning new England patriot Tom Brady fired up but not about tomorrow's game. Instead, the qb taking on the media. You want to try to use something and use it to take it out of context that you choose to do in the media. Reporter: That reaction after getting questioned about an appearance he made off the field which many interpreted as Brady mocking patriots owner Robert Kraft. Earlier this year Kraft pleaded not guilty to charges he solicited prostitution at a strip mall spa in Florida. That spa bears a striking resemblance to a fictional spa in the new Netflix show \"Living with yourself\" where Brady makes a cameo in the first episode. He's seen walking out of the spa and taking a relaxed breath. First time? Uh-huh. You? Sixth. Reporter: Despite what it looks like, Brady insisting the joke had nothing to do with the pats' owner. That't what that was about. I think that was taken out of context just like you're taking it out of context and trying to make it a story for yourself. Reporter: In context, the show's spa clones the customers into better versions of themselves. The crux of the joke implying this is how Tom Brady has remained so good at football. The show's creator, Timothy Greenberg, telling refinery 29 he wrote the scene years ago long before Kraft was charged but admitting after Kraft was arrested, he thought, all right, this is clearly not going to happen now. But the scene went on as scheduled, shot on a green scene with images added later, as seen in this exclusive photo from the Netflix shoot. Brady furious with the fallout. In over 20 years of covering him with the patriots, this was as angry as I've ever seen him. Because this was shot on green screen we're told Brady didn't know what this would look like until after it was released. Brady's got the jets tomorrow. Historically, angry Tom Brady is pretty unbeatable. That's a good point. If he's not on your fantasy team you should start tomorrow. I think he is on your fantasy team. We know your roster better than you. I like how we have to tell Dan that.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The star QB made a cameo in a Netflix show that unintentionally spoofed Kraft being charged with soliciting prostitution at a strip mall in Florida.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191020_gma_ault2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
