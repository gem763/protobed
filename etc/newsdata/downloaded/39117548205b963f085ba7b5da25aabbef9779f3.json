Four years later, she published two new works: a poem about Jacob\u2019s death, \u201cA Part Song\u201d, which won a Forward prize, and the essay \u201cTime Lived, Without Its Flow\u201d in a micro-press edition that was shared reader to reader like a samizdat pamphlet, and is now made widely available in this new edition, introduced by Max Porter.\n\nRiley drops the reader into the thick of life after death. She begins: \u201cI\u2019ll not be writing about death, but an altered condition of life.\u201d This straight-speaking clarity runs throughout, and helps the reader navigate Riley\u2019s complex thinking on what Alice Oswald called \u201cthe being of grief and not the feeling of grief\u201d. It is not a memoir: we learn only the barest of details about her son\u2019s death.\n\nA child\u2019s time is 'quietly uncoiling inside your own', so when the child\u2019s life stops, 'the purely cognitive violence of it' freezes the parent\u2019s time, too\n\nThe \u201caltered condition of life\u201d Riley experienced was \u201cthe curious sense of being pulled right outside of time\u201d. For two to three years after her son\u2019s death, she felt that time was arrested \u2013 stopped short \u2013 and most of the book records her contemporaneous efforts to write about this state of \u201cbright emptiness\u201d. This is difficult not just because a writer must \u201cpossess some feeling of futurity\u201d \u2013 she has lost that \u2013 but because she is forging new ground, having scoured the literature for previous reports of this experience and found the cupboard almost bare, except for a few lines here and there from Emily Dickinson, William Wordsworth and the 17th-century poet Henry King.\n\nTo be sure, early notes from the weeks immediately after the death (\u201cI want to say \u2018since he vanished\u2019. That seems far more accurate\u201d) are generic: no, there is no specific noun for a bereaved parent; yes, we recognise the denial stage. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t come home. What more does he want?\u201d But the rigour of original thought asserts itself. Riley believes that she is living outside time because for a parent, a child\u2019s time is \u201cquietly uncoiling inside your own\u201d, so when the child\u2019s life stops, \u201cthe purely cognitive violence of it\u201d freezes the parent\u2019s time, too. She cannot \u201cmove on\u201d because \u201cthere is no medium through which to move any more\u201d. Coming close to your child\u2019s death is, she makes clear, an existential risk to the survivor.\n\nThis book is without a scrap of sentimentality but provokes a deep emotional response: not from poignancy but in awe at the precision with which Riley records her grief. It is often too painful to read, but too valuable not to. Her aim is less to provide comfort to fellow travellers than to give the lucky many who will never experience a child\u2019s death a way to no longer say: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the death of your child, you see how the edge of the living world gives onto burning whiteness. [...] Nothing \u2018poetic\u2019, not the white radiance of eternity \u2013 but sheer non-being, which is brilliantly plain.\u201d\n\nSay Something Back by Denise Riley review \u2013 exquisite, intimate, direct Read more\n\nPublished alongside Time Lived, Without Its Flow is a new Selected Poems by Riley, which spans from 1976 to recently published work, and features all of her acclaimed 2016 collection Say Something Back, which includes \u201cA Part Song\u201d. Riley\u2019s poetry is taut and concise, often enigmatic, but rich enough to give us snow in six words (\u201cits grey and violet / trillion souls\u201d) or the hurting heart in seven (\u201cunder my shirt / with its atrocious beat\u201d).\n\nThe carefully weighted words in these two books are the hard-won results of \u201ca forensic labour\u201d; a small win set against the loss Riley has sustained, but a win all the same.\n\n\u2022 Time Lived, Without Its Flow for \u00a38.79 and Selected Poems by Denise Riley are published by Picador (\u00a39.99 and \u00a314.99).
