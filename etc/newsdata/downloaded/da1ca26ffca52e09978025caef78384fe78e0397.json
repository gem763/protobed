This December, the 106-year-old marque will enter new territory with the DBX, its first-ever SUV.\n\nYears before Aston Martin decided to move forward with an SUV, a small group of employees had already convinced themselves that Aston needed to produce a sport-utility vehicle. Talks of building one stalled with previous management; an SUV would have been an implausible -- and radical -- departure for the bespoke automaker.\n\nBut Miles Nurnberger always believed one would happen.\n\n\u201cDid design talk about an SUV? Yes,\u201d Nurnberger, Aston\u2019s director of design and a 12-year employee of the company, told ABC News. \u201cWe did little scale models in the corner as much to convince ourselves you can make a beautiful, dynamic SUV.\u201d\n\nThen Andy Palmer, a former executive at Nissan, took over as CEO in October 2014. Vehicles that were off limits were now being discussed in earnest.\n\n\u201cWhen Andy came on board it was music to the ears of me and Marek,\" Nurnberger said of Marek Reichman, Aston Martin's chief creative officer. \u201cWe\u2019d ask, \u2018When can we get on with it?\u2019 Andy was always an incredible advocate for the DBX.\"\n\nAston Martin\n\nReporters and Aston Martin owners got an early look at a pre-production DBX in August. Company executives, including Palmer, were on hand to answer questions and take orders at the VIP event. When the DBX hits showrooms in 2020, it will face stiff competition from Bentley\u2019s Bentayga SUV, the first premium ute to enter the market, as well as the 1-year-old Lamborghini Urus, already the Italian automaker\u2019s top-selling vehicle, and the regal Rolls-Royce Cullinan, which has an eight-month wait list.\n\nThe DBX was years in the making. But the result is an authentic Aston Martin, Nurnberger said.\n\n\u201cCould we have done this earlier? Maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have arrived with the right product and that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are waiting to see if the DBX will reverse Aston Martin\u2019s recent struggles. In July the company lowered its full-year sales forecast and slashed earlier investment plans, causing the stock price to plunge and sowing doubts about Aston\u2019s aggressive production targets. Demand for Aston cars has fallen by more than 20 percent in both the U.K. and Europe, two key markets for the company, and shares have lost more than half of their value since the company\u2019s IPO last October.\n\nAston Martin\n\n\u201cThe DBX is a very important vehicle for Aston,\u201d Ian Fletcher, a London-based analyst with IHS Markit, told ABC News. \u201cThe DBX opens the door to new customers -- not just the single man or woman looking for a weekend sports car.\u201d\n\nAston could sell 2,000 DBX units in its first year, proof that the vehicle has wide appeal, including in non-traditional sports car markets like China and Russia, according to Fletcher.\n\n\u201cThe DBX is not just for the U.S. customer,\u201d he said.\n\nStrong initial sales of the vehicle would also help Aston shift the conversation away from the dismal stock price and financial challenges that have weighed heavily on the company.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of focus on the IPO and making it a success,\u201d Fletcher explained. \u201cThe whole IPO has been a nightmare for them. The brand is so strong. It has all the links to James Bond. The IPO is not the full story.\u201d\n\nPalmer addressed underlying concerns about Aston\u2019s 2019 sales with analysts in July, saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the company\u2019s performance \u201cwas behind our original plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not immune to macroeconomic uncertainties, we have continued to see wholesale growth, retail growth and market share growth.\u201d\n\nKiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMcKinsey automotive analyst Simon Middleton agreed that stagnating economies in the U.K. and Europe and concerns over Brexit have negatively impacted Aston Martin\u2019s bottom line. Yet the company could also be doing more to avert these economic threats, he argued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Aston to move beyond GTs and sports cars,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cThe luxury segment is very volatile.\u201d\n\nAston Martin\n\nThe DBX comes at a pivotal time for the company, he said, and it\u2019s not too late for Aston to take market share away from its rivals.\n\n\u201cThere are some advantages of not being the first mover in the SUV space,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexy about a 3-year-old SUV.\u201d\n\nPalmer has doubled down on Aston\u2019s ambitious Second Century Plan, which he implemented as CEO. The plan calls for more vehicle diversification and seven new models over seven years. Under Palmer's direction, Aston has invested heavily in two mid-engine supercars and shoring up its lineup of traditional sports cars.\n\nThe $3.2 million Valkyrie, a hypercar built with a 6.5-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine, was shown at this year\u2019s British Grand Prix. In August, Aston\u2019s second mid-engine supercar, the Valhalla, had its North American debut in Monterey, California. Production of both supercars was capped; 150 Valkyries, described by Palmer as \u201ca Formula 1 car on the road,\u201d will be made, with the first customer delivery scheduled in late 2019. The Valhalla, limited to 500 units and powered by Aston\u2019s new hybrid V6 turbo engine, is oversubscribed, according to Palmer. It\u2019s expected to cost around $1.2 million.\n\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe Valhalla and Valkyrie have brought in quite a number of customers -- customers that would have traditionally looked to Ferrari and Lamborghini,\u201d Palmer told ABC News in August. \u201cHow do I get on the list for a Valhalla? That\u2019s what I have been hearing from customers. The answer is you can\u2019t. The Valhalla sold out within two weeks after it was unveiled in Geneva.\u201d\n\nAston Martin\n\nPalmer\u2019s goal is to keep prospective customers wanting the next Aston Martin, whether that be the Vantage AMR, DBX, Vanquish, or one of the special edition Continuation series cars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have people who like these kinds of cars, to allow them to be in early for the next one,\u201d he noted.\n\nAston Martin\n\nAston's fortunes also depend on sales of its flagship GT, the top-of-the-line DBS Superleggera coupe and Volante convertible.\n\nThe achingly beautiful DBS, the third new vehicle under the Second Century Plan, was designed to compete with the Ferrari Portofino and Bentley Continental GT. Matt Becker, Aston's chief engineer, said the DBS, with its twin-turbo 5.2-liter V12 engine and eight speed automatic transmission, was an engineering feat for his team. With a starting price of $304,000, the DBS had to handle \"really well\" and offer a high level of comfort even with the extreme power under its hood: 715 horsepower, a top speed of 211 mph and a 0-62 mph time of 3.4 seconds (3.6 seconds for the Volante version).\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges with a car like this was making it cool,\" Becker told ABC News in June at a test drive for the DBS Superleggera Volante. \"There is a lot of energy under the bonnet.\"\n\nAston Martin\n\nHe added, \"This car ticks all the boxes -- sounds great, rides well, steers well -- it feels very stable at high speeds.\"\n\nBecker encountered all new challenges when he was tasked with the DBX, which Palmer has called \u201cperhaps the company\u2019s most important car ever.\u201d\n\n\"The DBX is a completely new car,\" he said. \"It was the company's biggest focus.\"\n\nManagement wants the DBX to do what the Urus and Bentayga have done for Lamborghini and Bentley: attract new customers and generate enthusiasm with young and old drivers alike.\n\nThe decision for Aston to wade into the highly-competitive SUV space can pay off if executed correctly, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director at AlixPartners\u2019 automotive practice.\n\n\u201cThe product has to live up to customer expectations,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cThe \u2018specialness\u2019 and exclusivity of the brand has to be protected.\u201d\n\nWith SUVs accounting for 58% of the U.S. luxury vehicle market in 2018, automakers see SUVs as \u201cmore stable\u201d vehicles in terms of sales, which can lead to higher volumes, he noted.\n\nBut, \u201cit\u2019s getting harder to make an SUV stand out,\u201d Wakefield conceded. \u201cThe SUV cannot just cash in on the brand\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nNurnberger said the DBX will impress customers with its handling and agility. The design team had one important request to engineers: keep the classic grill intact.\n\n\u201cLook at the amount of sculpture -- see the muscles of this car pop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis for me is actually a GT car because you can drive it like a Vantage. It\u2019s a high performance SUV, absolutely.\u201d\n\nNurnberger said he and the other designers are already planning for the future, including the possibility of a plug-in hybrid SUV. But first the DBX needs to make its grand -- and long-awaited -- entrance.\n\n\u201cThe DBX is just the next step for Aston Martin,\u201d Nurnberger said. \u201cIn the beginning it was a lot of hard work. But it\u2019s a truly new segment. And that\u2019s super exciting.\u201d", "description": "Aston Martin's first-ever SUV will be officially unveiled in December.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/aston-martin-06-ht-jc-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
