(TSX:WDO) (\u201cWesdome\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announces its gold production results for the third quarter of 2019 (\u201cQ3\u201d).\n\nMr. Duncan Middlemiss, President and CEO commented, \u201cGold production in Q3 increased 29% over Q2 due largely to the continued stellar performance from our 303 area. With year to date production of 70,356 ounces, nearly the low end of our full year guidance range of 72,000 \u2013 80,000 ounces, we are raising 2019 full year production guidance to a range of 88,000 \u2013 93,000 ounces. Costs are expected to come in on the low end of our guidance of C$830 (US$640) on cash costs per ounce and C$1,280 (US$985) on all in sustaining cost per ounce. We have taken this opportunity of high production and favourable gold prices to accelerate our work within the Eagle River tailings area to increase capacity, install and commission a new Falcon Gravity Concentrator in our Eagle River mill, and enhance exploration platforms within the Eagle River Mine, in order to position the company for future performance improvements. The investment in our exploration program continues with five underground drills and one surface rig at Eagle River; and five underground drills at the Kiena Mine. The company is conducting the exploration program and infrastructure improvements all through cash generated from the Eagle River Complex.\u201d\n\nThird Quarter Year-to-Date 2019 2018 Variance % +/(-) 2019 2018 Variance % +/(-) Ore milled (tonnes) Eagle River 39,453 46,777 (7,324 ) (16 %) 99,148 134,635 (35,487 ) (26 %) Mishi 204 4,076 (3,872 ) (95 %) 37,297 62,155 (24,858 ) (40 %) 39,657 50,854 (11,197 ) (22 %) 136,445 196,790 (60,345 ) (31 %) Head grade (grams per tonne, \u201cg/t\u201d) Eagle River 23.4 13.3 10.1 76 % 21.9 12.2 9.7 79 % Mishi 2.8 3.4 (0.7 ) (19 %) 2.6 2.3 0.3 15 % Gold production (ounces) Eagle River 28,894 19,437 9,457 49 % 67,723 50,602 17,121 34 % Mishi 15 358 (343 ) (96 %) 2,633 3,769 (1,136 ) (30 %) Total Gold Production 28,910 19,795 9,115 46 % 70,356 54,371 15,985 29 % Production sold (ounces) 23,450 18,401 5,049 27 % 66,323 52,404 13,919 27 % Revenue from gold sales ($ millions) $45.9 $28.9 $17.0 59 % $120.6 $86.5 $34.1 39 % Average realized price per ounce 2 $1,957 $1,571 386 25 % $1,819 $1,651 168 10 %\n\nNotes:\n\n1.
