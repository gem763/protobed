Should the trajectory of the S&P 500 break outside of the redzone range, that would be an indication that investors have focused much more strongly on one of these two quarters.\n\nMuch of that dynamic has hinged on investor expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do in upcoming months with interest rates and its new T-bill buying policy. Right now, investors are betting the Fed will announce it will cut the Federal Funds Rate by a quarter point at its meeting at the end of this month, which could be the last cut for a while if the rate change probabilities indicated by the CME Group's FedWatch Tool is any indication:\n\nAnd then, there's that little matter of corporate earnings, which will be rolling out over the next several weeks, as well as other economic news that might alter the focus of investors. Here are the more significant headlines we plucked out of the news stream during the week that was.\n\nBarry Ritholtz found five positives and five negatives and no political noise that might affect the market in the past week's economics and market-related news.\n\nIf only there were no political noise to have to filter out. Wouldn't that be something!", "description": "For a market that got almost every bit of positive .10/21/2019 10:56:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Political", "Leah Barkoukis", "Guy Benson", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
