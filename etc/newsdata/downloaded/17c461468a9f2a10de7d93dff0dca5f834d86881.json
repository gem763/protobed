REUTERS/Alexandros Avramidis\n\nTHESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday Turkey should not try to coerce either Greece or Europe in its attempts to get support for a plan to resettle Syrian refugees in northern Syria.\n\nTurkey plans to resettle 1 million refugees there and may reopen the route for migrants into Europe if it does not receive adequate international support for the plan, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMr Erdogan must understand that he cannot threaten Greece and Europe in an attempt to secure more resources to handle the refugee (issue),\u201d Mitsotakis told a news conference in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.\n\n\u201cEurope has given a lot of money, six billion euros in recent years, within the framework of an agreement between Europe and Turkey and which was mutually beneficial,\u201d he said.\n\nGreece, which shares a long sea border with Turkey, was one of the frontline countries taking in many thousands of refugees and migrants at the peak of the migration crisis. In 2015, thousands of people were arriving on Greek shores every day.\n\nThe numbers dropped dramatically after the European Union and Ankara implemented a deal in March 2016 to cut off the flow, but there has been a recent uptick in arrivals on Greek outlying islands close to Turkey.\n\nRelated Coverage Greece to submit request on early IMF loan repayment this week - PM\n\nThe number of monthly arrivals to Greece jumped in August to about 7,000, the highest in three years.\n\nTurkey itself has nearly 4 million Syrians - by far the biggest group of refugees who have spilled over Syria\u2019s borders to flee a more than eight-year-old civil war.\n\nMitsotakis said he could not rule out a discussion in the \u201cspirit of goodwill\u201d at a European level with Turkey on how to extend the financial benefits of the 2016 deal. But this would not happen, he said, while Greece was on the receiving end of \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour.", "description": "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday Turkey should not try to coerce either Greece or Europe in its attempts to get support for a plan to resettle Syrian refugees in northern Syria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427577040&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870GC", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
