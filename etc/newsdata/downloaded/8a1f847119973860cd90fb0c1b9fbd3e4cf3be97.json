Arsenal manager Unai Emery was impressed with their display.\n\n\u201cMaybe with his (Saka\u2019s) goal and performance, he was taking confidence. He was finishing really strong,\u201d Emery said.\n\n\u201cAfter his injury, tonight he (Emile) played for the first time this season and he worked well. Willock started a little slow at the beginning but progressively he was feeling very better with a good performance.\u201d", "description": "Teenage forward Bukayo Saka said it was a \"dream come true\" to score his first Arsenal goal as he helped inspire them to a convincing 3-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431917515&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0M3-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
