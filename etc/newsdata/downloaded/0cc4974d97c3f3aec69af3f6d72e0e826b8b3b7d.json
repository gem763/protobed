Today, he says, the company has no loans with the West\u2014while its debt to the Russian state has swelled to $1.4 billion.\n\n\u201cIn the end, there\u2019s a lender of last resort and investor of last resort,\u201d Mr. Deripaska said in an interview.\n\nMr. Deripaska\u2019s debt shuffle is part of a shift in the Russian economy that accelerated when the West began to impose sanctions on Russia in 2014 after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula and launched a covert military operation in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, with Oleg Deripaska, in 2017.

Many of those now facing sanctions grew rich under his rule.\n\nEven before the U.S. began piling sanctions on Russian oligarchs, Mr. Deripaska had difficulty getting a visa to the U.S. because of alleged ties to criminal groups, a charge that Mr. Deripaska denies.\n\nMr. Deripaska\u2019s onetime aluminum company United Co. Rusal PLC was blacklisted together with GAZ by the Treasury Department last year for what the U.S. said was his supporting role in malign Russian activities abroad.\n\nSanctions on Rusal were eventually retracted, but Mr. Deripaska, anticipating the effects of sanctions on GAZ sales, said the auto maker\u2019s management of GAZ asked the government for 30 billion rubles (over $450 million) of support. Such a move would likely give the state a new and significant stake in one of Russia\u2019s most competitive automotive companies.\n\nMr. Deripaska dismissed accusations of his role in Russia\u2019s activities abroad and said he wasn\u2019t involved in any Russian attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nWestern banks now tend to edge away from lending to Russian corporations of any kind, fearing that the complications are too great. That has pushed Russian companies closer to native banks, the largest of which are state-run.\n\nThe GAZ factory in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The auto maker\u2019s debt to the Russian state has swelled to $1.4 billion, Mr. Deripaska said.

Sanctions have accelerated the growth of the state\u2019s role in the Russian economy, he said.\n\nOf all bank loans in Russia last year, 70% were provided by state banks, up from around 64% in 2016, according to data from Fitch. Russia\u2019s top 10 private banks\u2019 share of the loan market fell to 11% from 17% for the same period. Government funding of the banking system more than doubled to 8.44 billion rubles in 2018 from 3.55 billion rubles in 2016.\n\nThe state\u2019s growing stake represents a reversal after an era of privatizations in the 1990s that were intended to dismantle the vestiges of Soviet-era state control.\n\nMr. Deripaska calls the government\u2019s growing reach into the economy through loans and credit deals \u201csoft nationalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a private group, we operate on the market and any government subsidy is not free cake,\u201d he said, pointing to the government\u2019s growing influence in the private sector through one-off aid packages.\n\nOleg Deripaska outside the GAZ plant in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, in April.

Real incomes, meanwhile, have declined steadily in recent years, fueling discontent with Mr. Putin\u2019s rule.\n\nThe Kremlin is taking pains to reward some tycoons for their loyalty when they are named by the U.S., Mr. Fried said. For example, after Washington announced sanctions against longtime Putin ally Arkady Rotenberg in 2014, the Kremlin awarded a contract to collect taxes on truckers to a company controlled by Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s son. The contract and the taxes prompted public criticism and protests in Russia.\n\nMr. Deripaska isn\u2019t alone in looking to the state for support. The U.S. sanctioned six other Russian businessmen last year, including Viktor Vekselberg. Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s holding company, Renova Group, asked for almost $900 million from state banks to make up for loans called by Western banks, Russian media reported in May 2018.\n\nIn the defense sector, more companies facing sanctions are being bought up by Russia\u2019s state arms contractor, Rostec. Rostec bought United Aircraft Corp. last year, after years of losses at the U.S.-sanctioned aerospace and defense manufacturer.\n\nU.S. measures have also hit banks close to the state, forcing the government to come to their rescue.\n\nRussia\u2019s bailout of development bank VEB is perhaps the largest example. The lender was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2014 for its role in supporting Russia\u2019s military interventions in Ukraine.\n\nVEB bank had more than $10 billion in debts after funding construction for the Sochi Olympics. Russia helped refinance loans and supported the bank to meet its payments.

When sanctions cut the bank off from Western lending, the state helped refinance the loans and plowed cash into the bank to help it meet debt payments, according to people in Russian finance.\n\nMr. Deripaska said his businesses could limp along for years in the face of U.S. sanctions, and thanks to state-backed loans.\n\nAlthough U.S. sanctions targeted Russian state-run banks, the government is awash in cash from oil and metals revenues, and the Russian central bank has more than $500 billion\u2014one-third of the country\u2019s GDP\u2014in currency reserves and gold, according to central bank data.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Can sanctions split Russian President Putin\u2019s circle of allies? Join the conversation below.\n\nIf GAZ is slapped with sanctions, the company would likely be forced to shed part of its 65,000-person workforce, said Mr. Deripaska. GAZ has already been hit by falling demand for automobiles in Russia as the economy has stagnated.\n\nMr. Deripaska said the cost of borrowing on the domestic market for him, as a sanctioned individual, comes with a 20% premium.\n\nThe businessman managed last year to get sanctions on Rusal lifted by giving up control of the company. He said he has offered the same plan to the U.S. Treasury for GAZ but has received no response from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers and enforces sanctions.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t want to hear it; they\u2019re not interested,\u201d he said. The Treasury didn\u2019t comment on his account.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has given GAZ a series of extensions before finally imposing sanctions, to allow foreign partners to divest their interests from the auto maker. The next extension is due to end on Nov. 8.\n\nVolkswagen AG , which has contracts with GAZ, has indicated its operations will stop if sanctions come into effect, Mr. Deripaska said. Daimler AG , which also works with GAZ, suspended its operation \ufeff with the manufacturer in anticipation of sanctions, he said.\n\nWrite to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com and Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com", "description": "When U.S. sanctions forced Western banks to call in more than $200 million in loans from Oleg Deripaska\u2019s automobile manufacturer last year, the Russian tycoon turned to a deep-pocketed backer to bail him out: the Kremlin.", "authors": ["Thomas Grove", "Alan Cullison", "Thomas.Grove Wsj.Com", "Alan.Cullison Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105347/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
