the announcement a \u201cstab in the back\u201d, having been the US\u2019s main ally in the fight against Isis in Syria, where they lost some 11,000 fighters in the years-long battle.\n\nTurkish officials say they hope to establish a 20-mile corridor along their southern border from the Euphrates river 400 kilometres east to the Iraqi frontier, declare it a \u201csafe zone,\u201d and repopulate it with friendly Syrian Arab refugees instead of hostile Kurdish separatists of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and what they consider to be its Syrian affiliate, the People Protection Units (YPG), the main fighting faction of the SDF.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the Operation Peace Spring is to exterminate PKK/YPG and [Isis] from the east of the Euphrates, thereby providing security and safety for our people as well as enabling our Syrian brothers and sisters to return to their homeland,\u201d the Turkish presidency\u2019s office of communications said in a briefing paper distributed to international correspondents.\n\nAnalysts who have been briefed by Turkish military officials said Ankara would likely do the bare minimum to meet its limited tactical objective and hope that nothing will go wrong.\n\n\u201cSo far, all the people that I\u2019ve spoken with are repeatedly stressing that we march 20 miles and we stop,\u201d said Selim Sazak, a Brown University researcher who maintains ties with Turkey\u2019s military establishment.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email

We get our buffer. They go south to be the wardens of the Isis prisons. The further down south we move, the likelier we would end up with the Isis\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr Erdogan is often described as a brilliant tactical leader, but lacking in overall strategy. Under his 16-year reign, Turkey\u2019s foreign policy has been mostly inconsistent, and opportunistic.\n\nHis support for the uprising in Syria, part of his abandoned stance as a champion of the Arab Spring uprisings, badly backfired. The military intervention in northeast Syria is a last resort for a country genuinely afraid it will inspire separatist Kurds in Turkey, and hostile to the 4 million Syrian refugees it hopes will at least partially return to the \u201csafe zone\u201d it plans to establish.\n\n\u201cTurkish policies on Syria evolved and have been reactive for a long while,\u201d said Ziya Meral, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cTurkey does not have a clear strategy or long-term aim or exit strategy in mind. For now it is about denying territory to PKK-related groups.\u201d\n\nTurkey spent years laying the military, diplomatic, and political groundwork for the current operation, called \u201cPeace Spring\u201d. It voiced extreme discomfort with Rojava since its 2013 inception. The US decision to partner with the group rankled Turkey and became the main irritant in rising tensions between Washington and Ankara. Turkey\u2019s 2018 toppling of the YPG-led authority in the northwest Syrian enclave of Afrin, called \u201cOperation Olive Branch\u201d, can be seen as a trial run for the current operation.\n\nWithout American airpower [the Kurds] will easily be hunted down by Turkish planes and artillery Yoruk Isik, geopolitical analyst\n\nAnkara has spent the last year lobbying Russia, which has emerged as the key global player in Syria, as well as Mr Trump to push its plans for northern Syria, outlining its vision for a safe zone.\n\n\u201cThis had to happen,\u201d said Mr Sazak. \u201cThere was no way around it, except a YPG state on the Turkish border. It was either this or that. No third solution.\u201d\n\nOn the ground, Turkey so far has mostly used air power to shape the battlefield in its initial days. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a relatively risk-averse strategy, heavy on airstrikes and artillery, in preparation for mechanised assault,\u201d said Aaron Stein, Middle East director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington.\n\nThe first stage of Turkey\u2019s offensive is focused on a 100-kilometre rectangle stretching from border towns of Tel Abyad east to Ras al-Ain, with a depth of about 25km inside Syria.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at an operation that will secure a rectangle between those cities and give Turks firing range on the road between Hasaka and Kobane,\u201d said Nawar Oliver, a military analyst at the Omran Institute, an Istanbul-based think tank.\n\nCarving out the rectangle will allow Turkish and friendly forces to divide Rojava, and direct artillery and ground operations to secure the M4 highway coursing through northern Syria and begin to bleed Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain\n\n\u201cThey want to completely besiege Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain before they begin to either to clear it or just sit there and wait,\u201d said Mr Stein, who is a Turkey specialist.\n\nFurther stages will focus on expanding a zone of influence. In contrast to previous Ankara\u2019s attempts to carve out territories in Syria, the rebel fighters will likely take a back seat to uniformed Turkish forces. In both Afrin and Jarablus, the Syrian rebel fighters of the Free Syrian Army were criticised by locals for looting and unruliness in captured areas.\n\n\u201cSome of the locals in the area \u2013 even Arabs \u2013 are worried about some behaviours from the armed factions,\u201d said Mr Oliver. \u201cThere were a lot of problems with some of the behaviours of the factions. We don\u2019t want the same mistakes.\u201d\n\nAnalysts predict a short, intense war lasting weeks or several months followed by a more lengthy and messy period of stabilisation. Turkey\u2019s space for manoeuvre is constrained by geopolitics and its own military limits.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly gathering last month, Mr Erdogan showed a map detailing around 10 blue dots designated as the construction sites of settlements for Syrian refugees. But Mr Stein suggested each of those nodes also represented a permanent Turkish military position, such as those it has long operated in northern Iraq.\n\nTurkish officials say they have briefed both the US and Russia as well as Nato allies ahead of the incursion, and both Moscow and Washington appear to be setting rules for Ankara\u2019s movements.\n\nTurkey is also broke. Its economy is suffering, and wars are expensive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a broad vision,\u201d said Mr Stein. \u201cPeople keep trying to ascribe coherence. They have military objectives and they will meet those military objectives within six months.\u201d\n\nMr Isik, who monitors ship and plane traffic, detected planeloads of Russian aviation experts arriving in Ankara on Thursday, likely to assist in Turkish air operations over northeast Syria. But Turkey, a Nato member integrated into the US-led electronic and communications systems, is also dependent on Washington to operate its most advanced military technology.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the capacity to operate militarily on our own for months, without Russian and American assistance,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkish military officials are confident they can accomplish their goals quickly. Northeast Syria is mostly flat, a significant disadvantage to Kurdish separatist guerillas who are most effective fighting from mountains. Kurds fought effectively against Isis but that was mostly with the help of US fighter jets and artillery, which are aided by advanced guidance systems.\n\n\u201cWinter is coming, and it\u2019s going to be harder for the YPG to operate on the plains,\u201d said Mr Isik. \u201cWithout American airpower they will easily be hunted down by Turkish planes and artillery.\u201d", "description": "Across the world, supporters of the Kurds in northeast Syria have decried what they describe\u00a0as an impending land grab by Turkey;\u00a0a 19th century-style attempt by Ankara to recapture its former Ottoman imperial lands.\u00a0 But Turkish officials and analysts say Ankara\u2019s aims in launching its \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d are far less ambitious: an attempt to damage a threat at its", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/15/turkey-syria-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
