And actually, we should all be doing it,\" Prince Harry explained.\n\nAccording to Prince William (37), the trio used to go on litter-picking trips, Mirror reported.\n\n\"He took us litter picking when we were younger. On holiday!\" the Duke of Cambridge said.\n\n\"And again, both of us thought this is perfectly normal; everyone must do it. We were there with our spikes stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags.\"\n\nPrince Harry has continued to carry out his father\u2019s legacy of environmental conservation.\n\nHe made this quite evident in an essay recently written for the Telegraph in which he called for people to \u201covercome greed, apathy and selfishness to make real progress\u201d.\n\nSources: Express UK, Mirror, Telegraph, BBC", "description": "The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree \u2013 and Prince Harry is proof of that!", "authors": ["Lesego Mkhize"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9370/5051a83fa3fb4ef6b0c98c6768add8ad.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
