(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump congratulated US special forces, and himself, this weekend for the military strike in Syria that killed the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nBut a more detailed look at the operation suggests the success came in spite of \u2014 and not because of \u2014 Trump.\n\nThe strike wouldn't have been possible without three key factors, all of which Trump has tried to derail: a US troop presence in Syria; the Kurdish allies who were abandoned when Trump withdrew US troops; and the US intelligence community that Trump has spent three years attacking.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThis weekend brought one of the biggest victories in America's fight against terrorism in more than five years. President Donald Trump announced that US special forces carried out a military strike in Syria that killed the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe president and lawmakers lauded the soldiers and military leaders who participated in the operation and praised their bravery. Trump also thanked US adversaries like Russia and Turkey, which he said cleared airspace for US helicopters to make their way into an area near Syria's Idlib province, where al-Baghdadi was holed up.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's death was indeed a massive victory for the United States and its allies. And politically, the news is nothing short of a miracle for the president, giving him some ground to stand on as he battles a brewing impeachment inquiry and allegations that he leveraged US foreign policy in Ukraine for his personal gain.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that the US's operation against al-Baghdadi wouldn't have been possible without three key factors, all of which the president actively tried to undermine throughout his time in office:\n\nThe presence of US troops in Syria\n\nThe US's Kurdish allies in Syria\n\nThe US intelligence community\n\nThe al-Baghdadi operation wouldn't have happened if the military hadn't slow-walked Trump's Syria retreat\n\nFormer Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi speaks in a video released in April 2019, More\n\nReuters\n\nIn the weeks leading up to al-Baghdadi's death, Trump made the abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria, a move that caught Kurdish allies in the area off guard, opened them up to a Turkish assault, and effectively solidified Russia's dominance in the region.\n\nForeign-policy experts pointed out on Sunday that had the US military not slow-walked Trump's directive to pull troops from the area, the raid against al-Baghdadi wouldn't have been possible.\n\nRead more: Activist video purports to show moment of US raid on al-Baghdadi ISIS compound. Photos show the wreckage left in its wake.\n\nIndeed, the operation happened in spite of \u2014 and not because of \u2014 the president's actions.\n\n\"We must keep in mind that we were able to strike Baghdadi because we had forces in the region,\" Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, told The New York Times. \"We must keep ISIS from returning by staying on offense.\"\n\nAs Axios reported, al-Baghdadi's death was ironic because it underscored the importance of having US troops in Syria. It highlighted the argument in favor of continued US engagement and why Iraq and other countries were so caught off guard and worried when Trump announced the troop withdrawal.\n\nThe Kurds played an integral role even after being abandoned by the US in Syria\n\nkurds More", "description": "The US was able to neutralize the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi because of the intelligence community, Syrian Kurds, and US presence in Syria.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C_HoFlMb2AEBiNvV1oEPYA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/df9771de5cd216d045b862e6fd9f3a24", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
