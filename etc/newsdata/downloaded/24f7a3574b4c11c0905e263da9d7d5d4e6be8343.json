Yesterday, she took a different approach.\n\nThe 61-year-old comedian responded to online criticism brewing over her hanging out with former president George W Bush at a Dallas Cowboys football game on Sunday. Critics \u2013 who are predominantly part of the LGBT community \u2013 derided DeGeneres for getting close to a president who actively stood against the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nMultiple photos and clips were uploaded online showing the comedian and former president talking and laughing during the football game. The two sat in exclusive suite seats. (Ellen later clarified she was invited by the Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, and did not know Bush would be in attendance beforehand.)\n\nThe pushback was swift. LGBT publications voiced their anger at Ellen calling Bush a \u201cfriend\u201d.\n\n'You're trying to change the meaning of sex': supreme court hears LGBTQ cases Read more\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Bush, we\u2019re not talking about someone who released a book of remorse or went on a press tour where he repeatedly apologized to us (or the Iraqi people),\u201d the Advocate wrote. \u201cUnlike DeGeneres, I refuse to grade presidents on a curve.\u201d\n\nOut Magazine voiced similar disapproval: \u201cEllen DeGeneres laughing it up with someone who has actively tried to harm our community feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous.\u201d\n\nEllen chose to explain her actions, but not apologize for them.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d DeGeneres said at the start of her show, \u201cI\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different. And I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nGeorge W Bush had a dismal record on LGBT rights during his presidency and his administration did little to add protections for the community. In 2004, he came out in support of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage. He was also against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which proposed federal legislation that would have prohibited firing someone because of their sexuality or gender identity.\n\nMany people from the LGBT community have grown increasingly critical of DeGeneres\u2019s actions. She was the subject of numerous think-pieces and angry tweets after she invited Kevin Hart on her show to apologize for controversial jokes he made about beating up his son for displaying effeminate behavior. Many saw the invitation as Ellen putting her celebrity status before her LGBT identity.\n\nEllen re-emphasized her guiding philosophy on her show yesterday. A philosophy that stands in stark opposition to today\u2019s cancel-everything zeitgeist.\n\n\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another\u2019, I don\u2019t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,\u201d the talk show host clarified. \u201cI mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d", "description": "The LGBT community criticised the comedian for associating with the former president who has a dismal record on gay rights", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30f57746ba7677bf05951f3a83db4684c67b0de/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4657135b3ca0709275dcf234e4a86363", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
