Despite the violence they\u2019d just faced, they were boisterously singing, \u201cAm Yisrael chai,\u201d meaning, \u201cThe people of Israel live.\u201d\n\nIn the Jewish tradition, Yom Kippur is a day when God seals a decree regarding the fate of every person for the upcoming year. Rabbi Jeremy Borovitz, one of a group of Americans who was on that bus, said that the survivors felt deeply in that moment that they had been suspended between two worlds, between life and death, and had somehow come out alive.\n\n\u201cWe were alive and other people had died,\u201d Borovitz told HuffPost. \u201cIt was a joy that was certainly tinged with sadness.\u201d\n\nWhen the song ended, one passenger sounded a long note on the shofar, an ancient musical instrument used in Jewish rituals. Then people were dancing down the bus\u2019 narrow aisle \u2015 singing, clapping, spinning and smiling.\n\nIt is this spirit of defiance, of life bursting through even in the darkest of times, that Borovitz wants people around the world to remember about this tragedy.\n\n\u201cSometimes in the face of terrible hatred and sadness, I think we have to express joy for the miracles we have,\u201d the rabbi said. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t explain everything about what happened or why some lived and some didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe attack on the Halle synagogue sent shockwaves through Germany\u2019s Jewish communities and renewed fears about anti-Semitic violence in a country still scarred by the Holocaust. The synagogue\u2019s sturdy front door prevented the suspected gunman, a confessed far-right anti-Semite, from entering the house of worship where 51 Jews had gathered to pray. However, the shooter managed to kill two bystanders, identified in German media as Jana Lange and Kevin S., before he was captured by authorities.\n\nBorovitz was part of a group of about 23 Germans and Americans who had come to Halle to visit with the city\u2019s small Jewish community and bring a renewed energy to Yom Kippur services.\n\nCourtesy Base Berlin Rabbi Jeremy Borovitz and his wife Rabbi Rebecca Blady moved to Berlin in May to create Base Berlin, an initiative of Hillel Germany. Blady serves as Base Berlin\u2019s executive director, while Borovitz is its senior Jewish educator.\n\nThat mission of renewal is what drew Borovitz and his wife, Rabbi Rebecca Blady, to Germany in the first place. Earlier this year, the ordained couple packed up their life in Brooklyn, New York, and moved to Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg neighborhood with a big dream \u2015 to be part of the resurgence of Jewish life in that city.\n\nBorovitz said this kind of work has long been a passion for him and his wife. He remembers that one of his first conversations with Blady, the granddaughter of four Holocaust survivors, was about what it means to be Jewish in Europe.\n\nIn 1933, the Jewish population of Berlin was about 160,000, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Thousands fled the city as their rights were curtailed under the Nazis. Beginning in 1942, more than 60,000 Jews were deported from Berlin, many of whom were later killed in concentration camps. Only about 8,000 Jews were left in the city by 1945.\n\nSince then, Berlin\u2019s Jewish community has experienced a dramatic revival \u2015 first driven by the arrival of Jews from the former Soviet Union, and later by immigrants from Israel, Australia, France, the United States and other countries.\n\nFabrizio Bensch / Reuters Flowers and candles are seen outside the synagogue in Halle, Germany, October 10, 2019, after two people were killed in a shooting.\n\nBorovitz said signs of Berlin\u2019s dark history are still everywhere. The streets of the city are embedded with \u201cstumbling stones,\u201d cobblestone-sized brass plaques placed in front of houses where Holocaust victims once lived.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the past here,\u201d Borovitz said about the stones. \u201cThe past is part of who we are and the past informs who we are. But it doesn\u2019t have to define everything about who we are.\u201d\n\nBorovitz and Blady first came to Berlin for a monthlong stay in 2016, through a rabbinical school fellowship, Borovitz said. They rented an apartment and, as an experiment, threw a party for people interested in learning about Jewish life. About 27 people \u2015 mostly strangers \u2015 showed up, he said, which the couple took as a sign that there was a \u201cthirst\u201d for this kind of community in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere where I think Jewish revival is more acute today than it is in Berlin,\u201d Borovitz said. \u201cI think people really want to learn, they want to know, they want to build, to create. I also think there\u2019s a soul to this city and to this place that really breathes and infuses Jewish life, which I think gives it a unique character.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Base Berlin Rabbis Jeremy Borovitz and Rebecca Blady host discussions about Jewish life, ritual and identity in their Berlin apartment.\n\nIn May, Borovitz and Blady relocated to Berlin and officially launched Base Berlin, the first international outpost of the Base Movement, a network of Jewish community centers run out of rabbis\u2019 homes. The goal of the project, which is affiliated with the U.S.-based student organization Hillel International, is to build Jewish communities and educate young adults and families about the Jewish rituals, theology and identity.\n\nPeople swing by the couple\u2019s apartment to partake in Shabbat dinners, observe the holidays, attend Torah classes and learn how to bring Judaism into their own homes.\n\nBorovitz said folks who show up for their events come from a variety of backgrounds and levels of religiosity. Some come looking for community, others for knowledge about Jewish rituals. They get many participants whose families came from the former Soviet Union, Borovitz said, and who are now teaching their own parents about Judaism.\n\nFor Yom Kippur this year, Borovitz said the group wanted to visit a smaller Jewish community, where the synagogues may not be as full as they are in larger cities. Someone had a connection with a Jewish leader in Halle, which is why the group traveled to that city for the high holiday.\n\nHalle once had one of the largest Jewish communities in central Germany, The Guardian reported. But in 1938, mobs torched Halle\u2019s grand synagogue during Kristallnacht, a night of nationwide Nazi-instigated violence that targeted German Jews. The city\u2019s Jewish community has reportedly shrunk to about 700 people today. The congregation now meets in the old synagogue\u2019s former funeral home.\n\nHendrik Schmidt/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa / picture alliance via Getty Images Flowers and candles are placed next to the door of the Halle synagogue, days after a right-wing extremist attack on the congregation.\n\nWhen a loud explosion interrupted the Yom Kippur service this year, Borovitz credits the leaders of Halle\u2019s Jewish community with doing whatever they could to keep everyone safe and calm.\n\nBorovitz said those inside the synagogue knew that they had been attacked, but the details were sketchy. It was only later that they realized that the shooter had killed two people.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t stopped thinking about them since it happened,\u201d he said about the victims. \u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking that they lost their lives in this senseless act of hatred.\u201d\n\nThe synagogue was placed on lockdown and worshippers decided to continue the prayer service for another few hours before being evacuated to a local hospital. Afterwards, survivors gathered in the hospital cafeteria to conduct the Neilah, the final part of the Yom Kippur liturgy, \u201con our own terms,\u201d Borovitz said.\n\nIn the days since the attack, Borovitz said the couple\u2019s priority has been making sure that everyone from the group has the help they need to cope with their trauma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely impacted us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s impacted how we think about security. How do we remain as open as possible while being as safe as possible? All those questions are there.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Base Berlin Base Berlin is the first international outpost of the U.S.-based Base Movement.\n\nOn a personal level, he said he\u2019s still processing the fact that, after years of hearing about the rise of anti-Semitism around the world, he\u2019s now a personal witness to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely the one thing that keeps flying through my mind is I don\u2019t want to be remembered for the worst thing that has ever happened to me.\u201d\n\nLess than a week after the attack, Base Berlin was already getting ready for another Jewish holiday \u2015 Sukkot. During this ancient festival, it\u2019s traditional for people to erect temporary huts outside their homes to remember how God protected Jews during their exodus from Egypt.\n\nIt\u2019s a holiday that is meant to be joyous and celebratory. So on Oct. 17, Base Berlin\u2019s community members built a sukkah in a local beer garden, snacked on sausages and pretzels, listened to music and danced.\n\nThere is \u201creal, deep, meaningful Jewish life happening in Berlin,\u201d Borovitz said \u2015 and that\u2019s what he wants to focus on.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about anti-Semitism in Germany that gets people\u2019s attentions and we understand that. We can\u2019t ignore history,\u201d Borovitz said. \u201cBut we want people to focus on the life that is happening here, and there is incredible life happening here.\u201d", "description": "Rabbi Jeremy Borovitz was inside Halle's synagogue during a Yom Kippur attack.
