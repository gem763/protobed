Because she knew he [Kennedy] loved her much, much more than any of his dalliances.'\n\nSome of these transgressions were far more difficult for Jackie to to accept however said Simon.\n\n'For instance, his not being there for the birth of a child, his being off with a mistress while she was in the hospital,' said Simon of President Kennedy being absent for the birth of one of his children.\n\n'There are various things that he did that by comparison to having a mistress must have hurt more.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOpening up: Carly Simon (above) writes about her friendship with Jackie Kennedy in her memoir Touched by the Sun, which is on bookshelves today\n\nSomething rotten in Camelot: She reveals that Jackie told her President Kennedy was with his mistress when she gave birth to their child, confirming a long held rumor\n\nSimon reveals for the very first time in the memoir that she entered rehab to battle a opioid addiction.\n\nShe also reveals that it was Jackie who helped her through that difficult time.\n\nSimon said that she was only allowed to make one call a day at the facility, and that those calls almost always went to the same person.\n\n'Jackie,' recalled Simon.\n\n'She was being the mother that I never had.
