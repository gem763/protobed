History is on our side.\u201d\n\nSanders also said he thought, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve had a rough week. I\u2019ve suffered adversity and that\u2019s true. And I don\u2019t wish anybody to have a heart attack and get scared the way that our family did.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, many people are dealing \u201cwith a lot more pain than I am,\u201d including homelessness, the need to work multiple jobs or having to forego college because of fears about debt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be out there on the campaign trail,\u201d Sanders said, providing no details except that he would attend next week\u2019s debate in Ohio.\n\nHis wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, has said he would stay home recuperating until then.\n\nLater Thursday, he tweeted another, shorter video, apparently showcasing his endurance. Under the heading \u201cPlayoff baseball comes to our backyard,\u201d it featured Sanders hitting baseballs and exclaiming \u201cAlright!\u201d when people off camera successfully caught his pop-ups.\n\nThe self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Nevada last week. His staff initially said stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing two days later that he had suffered a heart attack.\n\nSanders took his message directly to supporters in the video after saying he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he previously suggested he may slow his campaigning after his health scare. Sanders backtracked in a Wednesday interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health could force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign and perhaps do fewer events per day - in the short term, at least.\n\nNational campaign Co-Chairwoman Nina Turner seemed to back up that original sentiment, though, saying in a Tuesday interview with The Associated Press that the campaign was examining where and how to make changes to reflect concerns about Sanders\u2018 health.\n\nThe focus on Sanders\u2018 health comes as age plays a significant role in the 2020 presidential campaign. Should Sanders win the Democratic presidential nomination, he would be the oldest person ever elected. So would his 76-year-old Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bernie Sanders said Thursday that he's getting his endurance back and growing \"stronger every day\" after suffering a heart attack last week, and he promised to return to the presidential campaign trail \"as soon as possible.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Weissert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/election_2020-sanders_22801_c0-10-1974-1160_s1770x1032.jpg?b3bcd2a7b52d51836e02e8891436e5b0b697b64d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
