That might sound like an unusual way to help out a British prime minister, but in the strange logic of Brexit, that\u2019s exactly how it works.\n\nJohnson doesn\u2019t actually want the extension he\u2019s asked for -- he only submitted the request after being boxed in by his opponents in the U.K. Parliament. The British premier would rather have a hard deadline and the risk of a chaotic no-deal exit to force lawmakers to endorse his withdrawal plans.\n\nMacron gets that. And he\u2019s happy to oblige because on that point at least, their interests are aligned. The French president also wants to get Brexit done.\n\nOld Rivals\n\nIt\u2019s not the way observers thought Brexit was going to turn out.\n\nFrom the very start of the negotiations in July 2017, two months after Macron\u2019s shock election victory upended the old political order in Paris, France has mostly taken the hardest line, frequently to the annoyance of other European governments. From cooperation on financial services to divvying up fishing waters, the U.K.\u2019s oldest rival has been the most stubborn negotiator.\n\nLike previous French leaders, Macron is suspicious of the U.K.\u2019s intentions in Europe. Postwar president Charles de Gaulle twice vetoed Britain\u2019s EU membership in the 1960s, while two decades later Francois Mitterrand clashed with Margaret Thatcher over the amount of money the U.K. contributed.\n\nSo Macron knows that acting tough on Brexit plays well domestically. And with Germany stuck in a political rut, getting the U.K. out of the club will help his efforts to reshape the EU along French lines.\n\nBut the dynamic changed when Johnson stepped in to replace Theresa May.\n\nAwkward, anxious May struggled to strike up a rapport with European leaders -- earning only respect, sympathy and, at times, disdain. Johnson\u2019s personal chemistry with Macron was evident from the outset.\n\nAt the Group of Seven meeting in Biarritz, France, in August, the president laughed heartily as Johnson regaled him with stories in his best French. They agreed on several global issues, and spoke warmly about each other afterward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a leader who demonstrates real strategic thinking and who has shown commitment and willingness to deliver,\u201d Macron said after an EU summit in Brussels a week ago. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t take him seriously were wrong, and will continue to be wrong.\u201d\n\nNeither of them are typical leaders. Though both are deeply rooted in their countries\u2019 establishments -- Eton and Oxford for Johnson, France\u2019s National School of Administration for Macron -- both see themselves as outsiders.\n\nJohnson spent most of his career on the fringes of the Conservative Party, only really taken semi-seriously. Macron set up his own movement to jump the queue to the French presidency and smashed the country\u2019s traditional two-party system in the process.\n\nCoordinating Plans?\n\nAs Brexit enters its endgame, both are keeping the world guessing about their real intentions. And the rest of the EU is every bit as annoyed with France as it is with the U.K., one EU official said.\n\nAt a meeting in Brussels on Friday morning, diplomats from 26 EU countries agreed that the U.K. should be given another three months to complete its departure. France was insisting on a month at most.\n\nMacron wants to put pressure on the House of Commons to back Johnson\u2019s deal, officials said. The rest of the bloc sees that as too much of a gamble because it could lead to a no-deal Brexit. So the decision was deferred.\n\nJohnson spoke to Macron last Saturday when the British Parliament refused to approve his Brexit deal. Officially that\u2019s the last time the two conversed, though there\u2019s speculation in London they\u2019ve texted each other since then to discuss France\u2019s position on the delay.\n\nFor now, a British prime minister has found a French leader he can see eye to eye with on Europe. Let\u2019s see how that holds up when they start discussing a trade deal.", "description": "Johnson and Macron: The Odd Couple Determined to Get Brexit Done", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/piccd2b61ed2b4b29f4ecf2e47841f365f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
