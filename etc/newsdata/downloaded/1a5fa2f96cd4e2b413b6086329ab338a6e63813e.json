Advocates have pointed to infrastructure as a key area for climate action and the bill could serve as a model for future efforts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appeared to endorse the bill in a tweet on Tuesday, potentially clearing the way for it to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cSenate is working hard on America\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Act,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWill have BIG IMPACT on our highways and roads all across our Nation. Interest strong from Republicans and Democrats. Do I hear the beautiful word, BIPARTISAN? Get it done. I am with you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new bill is the largest of its kind in congressional history and would provide $287 billion for surface transportation programs over the next five years. It replaces the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act that expires in 2020 and represents a 27% increase over levels in that legislation. But the bill also contains a notable emphasis on climate adaptation and mitigation.\n\nFor the first time, the bill contains a climate tier. More than $10 billion of the total would go to boosting climate resilience in major infrastructure projects, along with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That includes establishing a $3 billion carbon reduction incentive program, which E&E News reports would go to state projects that help lower vehicle emissions stemming from highways. A $4.9 billion resilience program is also part of the package, with the goal of prepping roads and bridges against extreme weather.\n\nElectric vehicles are also a consideration; $1 billion would go toward installing charging stations along certain highways, along with stations for hydrogen and natural gas. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) \u2014 the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide before it enters the atmosphere \u2014 would benefit from the bill as well.\n\nProponents of proposals like the Green New Deal \u2014 a plan to radically decarbonize the entire U.S. economy \u2014 have said a final proposal for such a deal could take the form of infrastructure legislation, among other components. While the new transportation bill is a far cry from such a plan, it still serves as an indicator that climate-friendly efforts are possible with support from both sides of the aisle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support from an array of backers. EPW Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) notably gave the measure his blessing in a statement.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Act will grow the economy, make our roads safer and enhance quality of life for the American people,\u201d Barrasso said. He indicated support for the streamlining of permitting projects in particular; Republicans have pushed for a reduction in federal \u201cred tape\u201d so that state projects can move forward more quickly. Barrasso also supports the additional funding for CCS, which has enjoyed backing from Republicans.\n\nDemocrats meanwhile highlighted the package\u2019s climate measures. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a noted climate hawk, has said the climate action components of the bill do not go far enough but that the legislation offers an improvement over prior efforts. Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-DE) meanwhile praised the bill\u2019s climate emphasis, arguing that it would \u201cmove our country toward a safer, more connected, efficient and climate-friendly transportation system.\n\nClimate advocates themselves have offered praise for some measures in the bill while criticizing other elements, like the permit streamlining. That component would allow for issuing one single environmental impact statement for large infrastructure projects, as opposed to going through various parts of government. Trump has advocated for this type of streamlined approach, which opponents say will roll-back environmental safeguards.\n\n\u201cTransportation is now the largest source of carbon pollution, and it\u2019s encouraging that there\u2019s bipartisan agreement to pursue pro-climate policies,\u201d said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, chief program officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in a statement. But, she caveated, \u201crollbacks of environmental protections\u201d and other elements of the bill pose a hurdle for environmental advocates.\n\nAfter receiving EPW backing, the Senate Finance Committee will now look into how to pay for the legislation, which could prove divisive \u2014 some have proposed raising the federal tax on gasoline, a move likely to be opposed by conservatives. In a nod to the bill\u2019s potential longterm success, however, Barrasso said that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is open to moving the bill forward before the end of the year.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1156329091.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
