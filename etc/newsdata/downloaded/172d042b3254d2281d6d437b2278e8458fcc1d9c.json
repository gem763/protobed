In September, they shared a video of them sloppily French kissing each other in a humorous reply to those who said they kissed like fish.\n\nIn fact, at least one report said whispers of a split began after Mendes deleted that video last week.", "description": "The \"Se\u00f1orita\" singers felt the breakup buzz was strong enough to warrant an online response.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dad9260210000431d34a8e2.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
