Fund managers worldwide are increasingly aggressive in demanding action from big companies to meet ever stricter investment criteria on climate change.\n\nBHP's Geoff Healy explains why CEO Andrew Mackenzie is committed to growing the miner's social value. AP\n\nLobby group Climate Action 100+ claims to have brought together 370 global investors with over $US35 trillion ($51 trillion) in assets to encourage change by 161 \u201cfocus\u201d companies, for example.\n\nAustralia\u2019s resource heavy economy is particularly vulnerable to this marked shift in investor sentiment, meaning key companies are attempting to get ahead of an accelerating cycle \u2013 even if it means getting ahead of Canberra.\n\nBHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie stirred up considerable antagonism in the federal government \u2013 as well as some of his peers \u2013 when he announced in July that BHP would attempt to reduce not just its own carbon emissions but those of its international customers.\n\nThis are known as Scope 3 emissions rather than the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions that are directly created by a company in producing whatever it sells.\n\nDespite the furore, BHP\u2019s commitment is less dramatic than its headline suggests. It\u2019s more about encouraging \u201cpartnerships\u201d to work with customers keen to improve their environmental impact. That includes $US400 million BHP is now dedicating to a \u201cclimate investment program\u201d to accelerate progress over the next five years \u2013 relatively modest in terms of its annual profit.\n\nBut BHP\u2019s willingness to refer to emissions created by its customers is still a major advance along the path most resource industry players have been forced down. Others are apprehensive about being held responsible for what they cannot control and fear the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions will only encourage the naive belief the world can do without key commodities, from coal to gas to iron ore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn BHP\u2019s view, however, the only way to counter this belief is to prove that such products can be delivered \u201cresponsibly\u201d and with an equitable distribution of value to all those involved, including local communities and employees \u2013 and the environment.\n\nThat sort of talk is enough to outrage everyone from cynics about the corporate game of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d to shareholders asking whatever happened to delivering for them. But companies like BHP argue social expectations have altered so much, so fast that such shifts in approach are required to build long-term value for shareholders as well as the wider community.\n\nIt\u2019s one more reason BHP announced this week it wants its Escondida and Spence copper mines in Chile to be 100 per cent powered by renewable energy by the mid-2020s as well as the elimination of water usage from aquifers.\n\nThe commercial justification is an estimated 20 per cent cut in energy prices and getting rid of 3 million tonnes of CO\u00b2 from 2022 by replacing gas. But this is part of a much broader switch in emphasis.\n\nSo Geoff Healy, chief external affairs officer of BHP, was in London last week and back in Australia this week briefing investors about the company\u2019s move from a concept of \u201csocial licence\u201d to \u201csocial value\u201d.\n\nHealy concedes balancing financial value and social value sometimes calls for trade-offs and is ultimately a matter of judgment. He had his slide pack on hand to show 80 per cent of asset managers consider ESG issues when making investment decisions and 61 per cent see evidence of execution as very important.\n\nIt's still part of coming to grips, he says, with the broader debate about the role of corporations in a world that has changed so much, even in the last 12 to 24 months. So rather than corporations being told to \"stick to their knitting\" by Australian politicians he sees the concept of social value as part of that knitting.\n\n\"You can't have a distinction where the role of the corporate is financial and everything other than that is something else,\" he tells The Australian Financial Review. \"Every business decision has a social implication. Sometimes it can mean giving something away on the basis it will pay off in the long run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are trying to empower all of the people on the front line of the business making hundreds of thousands of decisions to take into account those social implications.\"\n\nAs for climate change?\n\n\"Once society has made up its mind, which it has, we have to do our part. The risks and the opportunities of getting it right are massive.\"\n\nHe calls it \"plain and simple good business\".
