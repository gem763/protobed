When questions arise (Lease or buy a car? Refinance my home mortgage? Do I need long-term care insurance?), you do the research and come up with sensible answers. If you face a particularly complex financial decision, you tap an informal network of friends and family members for advice.\n\nAll in all, you\u2019re handling your money matters just fine. Why would you need a financial adviser? But you wonder if you\u2019re missing out by doing it all yourself.\n\nTo determine whether to retain an adviser, run a cost-benefit analysis. That requires two basic pieces of information: the planner\u2019s fee and the services you\u2019ll get in return.\n\nEvelyn Zohlen, a certified financial planner in Huntington Beach, Calif., says you can gather this data by scheduling a free introductory meeting with an adviser and asking, \u201cWhat services do you provide and how much will it cost?\u201d Some advisers list their fee structure on their website along with a breakdown of the services they offer and the amount of time they\u2019ll set aside to meet with you during the year.\n\n\u201cSome people wonder, \u2018Can I afford it?\u2019\u201d said Zohlen, national president of the Financial Planning Association. \u201cThey may think it\u2019s only for the rich. But many people are surprised.\u201d\n\nAnother surprise often relates to the planner\u2019s role. Consumers may not realize that an adviser doesn\u2019t just devise an investment strategy and manage a portfolio.\n\n\u201cFor many of my clients, I\u2019m the first adviser they\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Paul Fenner, a certified financial planner in Commerce Township, Mich. \u201cMaybe they signed on thinking I was just going to manage their investments.\u201d\n\nLike many advisers, he addresses a broad range of money-related needs,including developing a comprehensive saving and spending plan and guiding clients to make sound financial decisions. He cites the example of helping a 45-year-old single mother lock in a lower rate on her mortgage than she would\u2019ve found on her own.\n\nExamining the cost side requires a clear understanding of an adviser\u2019s price tag. While many wealth managers charge a percentage of assets under management (often 1%), others set a monthly retainer, flat fee, or hourly rate. Some advisers let clients decide whether they want to pay a percentage of their assets for investment management or handle their own investment accounts while just paying for comprehensive financial planning that typically encompasses areas such as retirement, estate, tax and insurance planning.\n\nFee-only planners are compensated directly by a client in exchange for advice, plan implementation, and/or ongoing asset management. They receive no commissions from financial institutions that sell products such as mutual funds.\n\nAs a rule, ask any adviser you\u2019re thinking of hiring, \u201cAre you a fiduciary?\u201d You want to hear a \u201cyes\u201d answer: Advisers who hold themselves to the fiduciary standard offer recommendations in their clients\u2019 best interest.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about hiring an adviser \u2014 or simply a cheapskate \u2014 it\u2019s possible to wade in without venturing too deep. After vetting a few finalists and investigating their background (see BrokerCheck.finra.org for any disciplinary blots on their record), select the best one and ask whether you can pay for one or two hours of their time for a consultation.\n\n\u201cIf you start by paying a fee-only adviser for 60 or 120 minutes at maybe $250 to $300 an hour, you\u2019ll have an idea if you need more,\u201d Zohlen said. For instance, you may conclude from that initial meeting that it\u2019s worth another $1,000 or more to obtain a customized financial plan that helps you map out your retirement.\n\nZohlen knows that do-it-yourself types have little inclination to hire a planner, and it\u2019s certainly doable to tackle all of it on your own. She says it boils down to the value you place on your time.\n\n\u201cIf you look under the hood, you see that it involves more than opening your statements every month,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was the last time you looked at your homeowner insurance? And are you doing the math to know how much you need in retirement? And are you tracking all the changes in estate and tax laws? It\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d\n\nRead: A Danish bank is offering mortgages with negative interest rates \u2014 why you shouldn\u2019t wish for that to happen in the U.S.\n\nMore: Want to retire rich?
