Mahendraparvata, does not seem to have been used as the capital for long because its mountainous location was unsustainable for inhabitants.\n\nThe heart of the Khmer Empire shifted to the city of Angkor, which lay to the south on a floodplain, and became the site of the now world-famous 12th century Angkor Wat temples.\n\nIt has remained a source of fascination to historians, however. \u201cThe city may not have lasted for centuries, or perhaps even decades, but the cultural and religious significance of the place has lasted right up until the present day,\u201d said Mr Evans.", "description": "An ancient settlement, known has the \u2018lost city\u2019 of Cambodia, has been rediscovered by scientists using aerial mapping after remaining hidden in dense jungle for centuries.\u00a0 Mahendraparvata, believed to have been the first capital of the Khmer Empire, a powerful Southeast Asian state that existed during", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eaDFYZ.iNg3KdSwXicCKQw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/4c53a737e35fff79ec8dcdd784c62776", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
