The panel says marijuana can provide temporary relief for anxiety but could cause panic attacks.\n\nIt also expressed concerns about autism patients and marijuana\u2019s effects on children\u2019s developing brains.\n\nBoard spokeswoman Tessie Pollock says the board could reconsider adding anxiety and autism to the list of 21 qualifying medical conditions if new studies or petitions are submitted.\n\nThe Ohio Medical Cannabis Cultivators Association says the board\u2019s decision harms people in need. The group notes 10 states allow medical marijuana for anxiety and 22 for autism.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The state Medical Board has voted to reject petitions seeking to add anxiety and autism spectrum disorders as qualifying conditions for physicians to recommend medical marijuana to patients.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
