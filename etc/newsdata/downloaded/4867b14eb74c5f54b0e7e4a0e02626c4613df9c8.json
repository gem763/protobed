Now we have a big home game on Monday,\u201d said Griezmann.\n\n\u201cWe suffered over there so we\u2019ll have to be ready.\u201d\n\nWith 37 international goals Giroud is third in the all-time scoring standings for France, behind Thierry Henry on 51 and Michel Platini on 41.\n\nAlready missing Pogba and the fleet-footed Mbappe, France also lost their midfield metronome N\u2019Golo Kante to a hamstring strain in the warm-up.\n\nBut the Euro 2016 finalists enjoyed 75 percent possession with Blaise Matuidi and Moussa Sissoko enjoying a great deal of the ball on the left.\n\nMatuidi hit the post on 77 minutes after a neat cutback from Bayern Munich midfielder Kingsley Coman and late substitute Wissam Ben Yedder almost added a late second.\n\nGiroud had picked up a yellow card for dissent after a penalty appeal for handball in the first half as the visitors fared poorly against a robust home defence.\n\nIn the French goal Steve Mandanda, in for Hugo Lloris after his dislocated elbow last weekend, made his first save on 30 minutes into the game and was little troubled thereafter.\n\nFrance beat Iceland 4-0 at home back in June and the two had history after their quarter-final meeting during Euro 2016 which Les Bleus also won 5-2.", "description": "Reykjavik (AFP) \u2013 Depleted France needed an Olivier Giroud penalty to edge past Iceland 1-0 and keep pace with Turkey in their Euro 2020 Group H", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/b6fcf3_france-olivier-giroud-2nd-celebrates-scoring-goal-in-win-in-iceland-giroud-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
