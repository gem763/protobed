This hasn\u2019t happened in any real sense.\u2019\n\nBut of course, once again, we have learned how the wisdom of the Founding Fathers is relevant to this very day.\n\nIf a foreign country can actually affect our elections, Americans will lose faith in our democracy \u2013 this grand and wonderful democracy.\n\nSo we must guard against that, but at the same time we have to do two things at once. We can protect our constitution and do things average working families need at the same time. And Democrats are intent on pushing for working families\n\nFrom the very beginning, Senate Democrats have been committed to doing the people\u2019s business.\n\nThe price of health care is too high, incomes are too low.\n\nOur infrastructure is crumbling, gun violence is an epidemic.\n\nToo many Americans have trouble voting, and our elections remain vulnerable to foreign interference.\n\nClimate change is an existential threat to the planet that demands bold and far-reaching action.\n\nOver the course of his presidency \u2013 long before the House investigation \u2013 President Trump has failed to offer serious proposals to address any of these issues.\n\nIn many cases, his policies have made things worse.\n\nAnd while the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has passed hundreds of bills dealing with health care, infrastructure, gun violence and much, much more, the Republican Leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, has turned our chamber, the Senate, into a legislative graveyard.\n\nNot one of those bills has even received a vote in the Senate: no vote to save protections for people with pre-existing conditions, no vote on bipartisan background checks, no vote on bipartisan election security legislation, no vote on the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nSo as Congress comes back into session next week, Senate Democrats have a plan to jolt the Senate into action on several important issues.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we will force our Republican colleagues to vote on whether to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions or not; to protect middle-class families from a tax hike or not, to protect our climate or not.\n\nAnd we will also demand that our Republican colleagues take up legislation to protect hard-earned pensions for millions of workers, and they are in danger of losing it right now.\n\nAs we continue to fulfill our solemn constitutional duty to hold the president accountable, Senate Democrats will never, never stop putting pressure on Leader McConnell to get the Senate back to work for the American people.\u201d", "description": "During Friday's Democratic Weekly Address, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that when Congress returns to session, Senate Democrats will | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/chuck-schumer-smiling-Joe-RaedleGetty-Images-via-JTA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
