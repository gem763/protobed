The pair entered into a very fruitful partnership with Ryan Reynolds that has lead to two Deadpool movies (well, two and a half), the underappreciated space horror Life, and the upcoming reboot of Clue. Over the course of a decade, a Zombieland sequel has shambled behind them like an undead shadow, existing at one point as a TV show (Amazon passed) and always as a hypothetical follow-up film to the smash hit from 2009. Then last year, Reese and Wernick confirmed to Vulture that they were finally at work on a feature-length return to Z-Land with the original cast in tow, and now this weekend, Zombieland: Double Tap arrives in theaters with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) all returning to slay some automatons and sort out their found-family foibles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like putting on that old comfy sweater that just makes you feel warm inside,\u201d Wernick says of his experience bringing the story back, if that sweater were covered in gunpowder residue and stained with the entrails of exploding zombie parts. Before Double Tap\u2019s release, Vulture spoke with Reese and Wernick about why it took so long to \u201cget the band back together,\u201d and the simple joy of ending the world before the current presidential administration had a chance to take power.\n\nSo, it\u2019s been a decade. What took you guys so long?\n\nRhett Reese: Essentially, we wrote Zombieland 2 on the heels of Zombieland 1, and the movie took place right at the end of the Zombieland 1, with Little Rock being a 12-year-old girl and all the characters just where we last left them. For different reasons, partly script but mostly scheduling, it just didn\u2019t get going. Years started to pass and I think the combination of Ruben [Fleischer, the director] going off to do other movies, us leaving to do Deadpool, and Abigail Breslin growing up left the project in a state of limbo. We had to kind of redesign a story that would take into account that she\u2019d become a young woman. So Dave Callaham and Oren Uziel came in \u2014 two really excellent writers \u2014 and helped sort of reconceive an idea in which Little Rock went on the road and the others had to go save her. Then ultimately we came back for a couple of years to rewrite what they had done. You add it all up and it was ten years later. It was definitely one of those exercises in delayed gratification. We had to all kind of relax and hope that someday it would get there, and it did. Now we\u2019re here and we\u2019re going to pretend like it never happened!\n\nPaul Wernick: We didn\u2019t think it would ever come together. All the actors are so sought after. With Emma and Woody and Jesse and Abby, the stars needed to align. Literally. Hollywood\u2019s a crazy place, and we just thought we were one and done. Everyone got a Zombieland and it turned out great and we moved on, as much as we love the franchise and as much as we love each other. I think it was that love that made everyone want to get the band back together and do it again.\n\nDoes this mean we\u2019ll see you here again in another decade?\n\nWernick: We\u2019d love nothing more than to continue to tell stories in Zombieland. That\u2019ll be up to the audience pending Zombieland 2\u2019s success. There are still more stories to tell, and these are still characters we absolutely adore and want to continue to live with for as long as people allow us to, and I think the cast and Ruben all feel the same, too. Woody was telling me the other day he wants to make ten more of these, but I don\u2019t know how realistic ten more of these are.\n\nThe first Zombieland really feels like a crazy combination of luck and timing, getting the actors you did ten years ago and landing that Bill Murray cameo for a glossy zombie comedy. With the success of the first in your pocket, did that make it easier to get what you wanted for Double Tap?\n\nWernick: Yeah, a lot easier. Getting people for the first Deadpool was super difficult. We got a lot of no\u2019s, just like we got a lot of no\u2019s on the first Zombieland. Ultimately, we ended up with Bill Murray, but we got a lot of no\u2019s getting to him. Getting Bill on the first one was like, \u201cOh my God. I can\u2019t believe it! He\u2019s not going to show up. Is he gonna show up? How do we get him? Do we go on plane and actually just grab him and put him onto a plane?\u201d And this one, it was like one call.\n\nRhett: You would expect that in Hollywood after you\u2019d succeeded once that you\u2019d be left alone the second time, but really more often it\u2019s the opposite. If you\u2019ve succeeded once, there\u2019s more scrutiny, because suddenly the project is a tent pole, right? It\u2019s a franchise. It means a lot to the studio. Well, what we\u2019ve been fortunate about is that both Fox and Sony in the case of Deadpool and Zombieland specifically, they really bucked what\u2019s the usual trend of extra scrutiny and extra cooks in the kitchen. They really did let us go largely make the movie we wanted to make. I mean, you get studio notes. You always get studio notes, but they were helpful and they were not obtrusive. We really weren\u2019t meddled with that much.\n\nAnd since sequels are generally bigger and more expensive than a first film, did you have a crazy wish list you put in with the studio?\n\n\ufeffReese: For sure. We have stuff like monster trucks and people falling off towers and the leaning tower of Pisa falling over. There\u2019s no question. You tend to think a little bit bigger, and yet at the same time we never felt like budgetarily or otherwise that this should be a massive movie. It\u2019s a reasonably sized movie that\u2019s not about necessarily saving the world. It\u2019s grounded, and it\u2019s about these four people, some new friends, but we wanted to make sure it kept that kind of neighborhood-y, independent feel and didn\u2019t become a massive, bloated sequel.\n\nSpeaking of new friends, how much of Zoey Deutch\u2019s character Madison is what you guys built into the character, and how much is her just playing it to the hilt?\n\n\ufeffWernick: I\u2019d say we gave her the framework on a page, but my God, she ran wild in a way that just brought a great delight to us! In the wrong hands that character would have been, \u201cOh, God. She\u2019s super the worst!\u201d But she\u2019s so delightfully bad. She\u2019s endearing and, you know, dumb like a fox. Zoey is a force of nature, and we hope to continue to work with her for a very long time. Ruben and Zoey were even talking at one point about spinning off the character into her own Zombieland movie where we track Madison in the postapocalypse.\n\nThere has been a run of very good, very somber zombie movies over the past few years, but suddenly there\u2019s this rush of zombie comedies like Little Monsters and The Dead Don\u2019t Die and One Cut of the Dead. Did you realize you\u2019re part of a movement to bring the fun back to zombies?\n\nReese: Generally when we\u2019re knee-deep in a genre, we\u2019re trying to clear our heads of our competition as opposed to seeing what they\u2019re up to. So, we haven\u2019t seen those movies, but I think from the original George Romero movies, there was always a wry sense of humor involved. I think it was probably time again. These things ebb and flow. Walking Dead is so serious, and hopefully people are ready for the lighter side of the postapocalypse. Paul, you always call it wish fulfillment.\n\nWernick: Yeah. We always think, \u201cOh, my God. It\u2019s the postapocalypse! How terrible this would be!\u201d And we\u2019re like \u2026 actually it would be kind of fun to able to drive any car you want and go in any store you wanted. There is some wish fulfillment to being able to have no consequences. Sure, there are zombies out there, and yeah, they can kill you. But there\u2019s also a lot of fun. You can go stay at the White House.\n\nReese: Paul wants to be off the grid. This is his escape.\n\nWernick: It\u2019s the truth! But think about it; you\u2019re being hunted by flesh-eating monsters, but you get to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom if you want. That\u2019s pretty awesome. There\u2019s some benefits to lawlessness out there, Jordan. Believe me.\n\nI\u2019m realizing that, because the Zombieland world is basically frozen in time, we\u2019re experiencing an apocalypse that started ten years ago, meaning there\u2019s no awareness of why the world would end in the ways we joke about it ending now. Perversely, that makes Z-Land feel like a safe place to go back to.\n\nWernick: You\u2019re so right. The world is terrible in 2019, so there\u2019s something nostalgic about the world ten years ago where it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it was a simpler time than the world that we\u2019re all currently living in. If we could only go back to 2009 and watch the world end!\u201d", "description": "Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the co-creators of Zombieland, talk about their sequel, Double Tap, and the relief of ending the world in 2009.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-rhett-rees--and-paul-wernick-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
