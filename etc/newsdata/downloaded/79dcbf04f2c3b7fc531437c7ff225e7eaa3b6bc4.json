But the studio said no. The director relives a six-month spat\n\nEvery year for the past three decades, Michael Winterbottom has made a movie. Britain\u2019s most mercurial director may have hopped between genres like a frog on a bouncy castle, but he has stuck to a strict schedule \u2013 inspired, apparently, by the subject of his first film, Ingmar Bergman. (Bergman only agreed to the documentary because he was so tickled by the then 25-year-old\u2019s surname. \u201cIt\u2019s the one time it\u2019s been a help,\u201d says Winterbottom. \u201cAs a child, it wasn\u2019t the easiest.\u201d)\n\nGreed review \u2013 Steve Coogan gleams in knockabout satire of the mega-rich Read more\n\nNow, abruptly, that routine has changed. Winterbottom is on sabbatical. To recover, it turns out, from the past six months, spent unsuccessfully haggling over the final cut of his latest film.\n\nGreed is a boisterous satire largely set during the lavish 60th birthday party in Mykonos (Coldplay, newly built amphitheatre, lion) of a British fashion mogul with deep tan and alarming teeth, based heavily on Philip Green. Steve Coogan stars; David Mitchell plays a journalist roped into writing his biography, who travels to the far east to tour the factories which manufacture the clothes that have made his subject so rich.\n\nThe original version of the film ended with a series of cards spelling out how real life is yet more grotesque than fiction. How workers in Myanmar and Bangladesh earn $3.60 and $2.84 a day making clothes for British high street brands, while H&M\u2019s owner, Stefan Persson, is worth around $18bn and Zara\u2019s owner, Amancio Ortega, $67bn.\n\n\n\nAt the first test screening in March, reports Winterbottom, these cards were a big hit. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t find the message annoying, they loved it. But, unfortunately, we were told we couldn\u2019t put them in the film.\u201d\n\nThis was the decree, he says, of Laine Kline, head of Sony Pictures International, which co-financed Greed with Film4 and is distributing it worldwide. \u201cHe was like: I don\u2019t care it\u2019s the most popular bit. We\u2019re not going to have mention of individual brands in those cards or individual billionaires. Because we\u2019re worried about the potential damage to Sony\u2019s corporate relations with these brands.\u201d\n\nWinterbottom took note. Replacement cards were made and test-screened. These, too, he says, went down well with everyone except Kline. The director dug his heels in, but he was standing on quicksand: the final say rested not, as he imagined, with himself, or with frequent collaborator Film4, but entirely with Sony.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You want to make people feel angry\u2019 \u2026 Michael Winterbottom on the set of The Trip to Italy. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nWinterbottom does not appear an especially angry man. We meet a couple of times, once at the Guardian offices, where he could easily pass for a foreign editor, and once for coffee, near his home. In fact, for 58, Winterbottom is quite mumbly, self-effacing and averse to talking personally \u2013 not just about his private life (he lives with his producer, Melissa Parmenter, and their eight-year-old son, Jack; he also has two daughters, Ruth and Anna, from a previous marriage), but his own ethical negotiations (he eventually tells me his trousers are from sustainable tailor Oliver Spencer). He\u2019s also relaxed, fast to laugh \u2013 and evidently livid within.\n\nDoes he regret not tooth-combing the paperwork? \u201cAs a director, I don\u2019t really get too bogged down in legal contracts. Obviously, on reflection, it would have been good to know.\n\n\u201cBut I did a film 20 years ago, structured the exact same way, in which Film4 split the finance 50/50 with Miramax, when Harvey Weinstein was at his most bullish. At that point Film4 seemed to have as much say and clout determining the content as Miramax. But in this case it was just like: well, sorry, we don\u2019t agree with Sony, but you\u2019ve got to take the credits out.\u201d\n\nSony declines to comment, but Film4\u2019s defence rests on the reminder that Winterbottom signed an agreement which \u201cstated that if any creative or business discussions reached a deadlock, Sony\u2019s view would prevail. Editorial discussions between partners are part and parcel of independent film-making and usually resolved in the cutting room. Film4 always back our film-makers and are very proud of the finished film of Greed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Catwalk king \u2026 Steve Coogan in Greed. Photograph: Sony Pictures\n\nStill, there\u2019s a troubling muddle here. It\u2019s true that the original script of Greed did not detail the content of these end cards, instead saying it would \u201cgo to a documentary sequence\u201d. \u201cWe talked about it,\u201d says Winterbottom, \u201cbut hadn\u2019t actually written down the facts and figures because they always change.\u201d\n\nAnd the entire pitch of the film is an upfront expos\u00e9 of wealth inequality that does name and shame real-life brand owners in a scene which was in the original script, when Coogan\u2019s character appears before a select committee.\n\nThe impact of the film was bigger when we were being more specific, more dynamic, more impactful, more clear\n\nWinterbottom has a platform to hammer home the facts: last month he read many of them out on stage after the film\u2019s Toronto premiere \u2013 attended, of course, by studio bigwigs. \u201cNo one died of shock,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one is going to be, like: \u2018Oh my God, Sony is releasing a film that mentions the fact Ortega is worth $60bn.\u2019 It\u2019s just public knowledge. In fact, it shows he\u2019s been a success.\u201d\n\nSo why whistleblow? Does he think Sony might reconsider? \u201cWell, that would be good. The impact of the film was bigger when we were being more specific, more dynamic, more impactful, more clear. But I\u2019m not expecting them to.\u201d\n\nI think Winterbottom feels compelled to spill the beans because what happened so offends his sense of justice. On principle, he says, a publicly owned and funded British company shouldn\u2019t sign over control of a British story to a multinational.\n\nHe\u2019s also exercised about what he sees as a betrayal of the tax credit system set up in 2007 to enable Film4, BBC Films and the BFI to support British independent film-makers. In the case of Greed, half those benefits have gone to Sony. \u201cThat seems to me to be wrong.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Festival favourite \u2026 Winterbottom with Rob Brydon, left, and Steve Coogan filming The Trip to Spain in 2016. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nThe consistent beat in Winterbottom\u2019s career \u2013 louder even than sex or pop or celebrity \u2013 is iconoclasm: banging the drum for the man morally wronged by an institution. It just so happens this is the first time he feels it\u2019s happened to him.\n\nBorn in Blackburn in 1961, Winterbottom\u2019s mother was a teacher, his father a draftsman in the factory where A Kind of Loving was shot. After university, he worked as an assistant for Lindsay Anderson (whose memoirs describe him as \u201cattractively cherubic\u201d). His debut proper was Butterfly Kiss, about lesbian serial killers on the M6, and accepted by the Berlin film festival - which gave him its top prize in 2003 for refugee docodrama In This World.\n\nThese days, the main question he says he\u2019s asked at festivals is when the next Trip is out. Six months after finishing Greed, Coogan and Winterbottom returned to Greece to shoot a fourth instalment of the comedy in which Coogan and Rob Brydon irritate each other over tasting menus. Winterbottom tells me gleefully about a scene involving the same real-life refugee who features in Greed (as a troublesome blight on the beach), and who, in The Trip to Greece, Coogan apparently fails to recognise.\n\nOur compartmentalisation of the plight of migrants mirrors our failure to engage with the realities of fast fashion, Winterbottom thinks. Both situations are solvable only by systemic change, but that shouldn\u2019t stop individual protest.\n\nI've met lots of very serious actors who are endorsing a watch. I find it a bit baffling. They don't need a free watch but they still want one\n\n\u201cWith refugees, it\u2019s a collective failure because government represents us. My mother had refugees and evacuees in her house during the second world war. Back then we assumed solidarity with people fleeing war. We would have never have said: let\u2019s not even rescue these people, let\u2019s let them drown. But we\u2019ve become a more selfish and atomised society and that\u2019s affected our sense of solidarity.\u201d\n\nBecause we\u2019re self-obsessed? Nope: market ideology has infected our psyche. \u201cEverything\u2019s become more financialised; it\u2019s all about how much cash you have.\u201d\n\nEven those with plenty of it \u2013 plus social conscience to burn \u2013 can\u2019t help themselves, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve met lots of very serious actors who are endorsing a watch. I find it a bit baffling. They don\u2019t need a free watch but they still want one. They see themselves as a brand, supporting another brand.\u201d\n\nGreed review \u2013 Steve Coogan gleams in knockabout satire of the mega-rich Read more\n\nA clutch of celebrities \u2013 Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Stephen Fry \u2013 give meta-cameos in Greed, paying grisly lip service to Coogan\u2019s mogul. This, says Winterbottom, was to highlight the symbiosis between the famous and the filthy rich; the glamour bestowed by association and the confusion this creates for the consumer, who\u2019ll think of an A-lister when buying a frock, rather than the woman in the mud hut who made it. (Winterbottom mutters darkly about the \u201cfemale empowerment\u201d message of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Topshop range \u2013 which she pulled after the allegations Green behaved inappropriately to his staff.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Launch of the Kate Moss for Topshop Collection in 2014 \u2026 from left, Suki Waterhouse, Philip Green, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images\n\nSuch stars were no more let off the hook in Greed\u2019s first cut than Persson or Ortega. Those pesky end captions, it emerges, also \u201coriginally pointed out that people like Beyonc\u00e9 and Stevie Wonder, Robbie Williams, Tom Jones, Jennifer Lopez and Destiny\u2019s Child have all been happy to take cash to go and play at Philip Green\u2019s parties\u201d. Guests, Winterbottom reminds me, have included Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gwyneth Paltrow and that beacon of eco-consciousness, Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nSony, unsurprisingly, said no to those too. Its refusal, says Winterbottom, fatally blunts a tale he made for its sting: \u201cYou want to make people feel angry and frustrated and to want change.\u201d\n\nHe zips up his cardie and heads back to his sabbatical, unfussed by the bridges burning behind him.\n\n\u2022 Greed opens in the UK in February; its European premiere is on 8 October at the London film festival.", "description": "His fashion tycoon send-up, starring Steve Coogan with alarming teeth, was meant to end with shocking figures about workers\u2019 pay.
