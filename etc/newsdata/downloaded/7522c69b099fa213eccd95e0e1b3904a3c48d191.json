Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont advocate a clean break not just from Mr. Trump but also from the party\u2019s past economic policies.\n\nMr. Biden is charting a different course, envisioning, as he put it in June, a \u201creordering\u201d of capitalism that \u201cdoesn\u2019t require some fundamental shift.\u201d\n\nThe Biden economic platform is a tricky balancing act, an attempt to bridge the big differences between the party\u2019s increasingly aggressive left wing and moderates turned off by the big-government proposals gaining traction in the nominating contest. His campaign is hoping to tap into the same progressive energy that animates activists\u2014offering to update the Clinton-Obama model he helped craft\u2014while reassuring centrists he\u2019ll preserve the party\u2019s structure, brain trust and core positions.\n\nMr. Biden addressed the Poor People\u2019s Moral Action Congress in Washington on June 17.

But his specifics are more modest: spending and taxing less than his leading rivals would and focused more on modifying programs rather than replacing them.\n\nMr. Biden would alter capital-gains taxes in a way that would raise an estimated $400 billion over a decade; Ms. Warren would tax wealth directly, claiming her plan would raise $2.75 trillion. Mr. Biden embraces a plan costing $750 billion over 10 years to expand the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders would spend at least $30 trillion to replace the ACA, known as Obamacare, and all private health insurance with government-run Medicare for All.\n\nBiden rivals say a platform promising a kind of third Obama term risks mimicking the failure of Hillary Clinton, offering incremental change to an increasingly agitated electorate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat Trump unless we can energize young people, people of color, working-class people,\u201d said Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver. \u201cThe problem with a candidate like Joe Biden is that he\u2019s not going to excite those people.\u201d\n\nMike Donilon, a campaign adviser who has worked with Mr. Biden since 1981, said the Biden platform represents \u201cas big and bold of a vision\u201d as any candidate\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre world that building on Obamacare has somehow become incremental and small.\u201d\n\nWhile primary opponents consult young, liberal economists new to the national stage, Mr. Biden turns to party stalwarts such as Bruce Reed, a leader of the Democratic Leadership Council that laid the groundwork for Bill Clinton \u2019s 1992 run and the architect of the Clinton welfare overhaul condemned by the left.\n\nMr. Biden has maintained ties to wealthy donors who funded the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama. Guests at the Carlyle fundraiser included prominent financiers some rivals shun, including former Goldman Sachs co-chairman and Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Roger Altman, a Clinton Treasury official and co-founder of investment advisory firm Evercore .\n\nMr. Biden appeals to the base by invoking tales of his working-class roots. For years, he was among the Senate\u2019s least-affluent members, repeatedly mortgaging his home to pay for his children\u2019s education. On the campaign trail, he refers to himself as \u201cMiddle Class Joe.\u201d\n\nAs a political gambit, his straddle seems to be working so far. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll published Tuesday showed him maintaining his lead over the Democratic pack, while other surveys find him beating Mr. Trump in a hypothetical matchup. The Journal poll also showed the Democratic electorate has strong enthusiasm for the Obama-Biden legacy\u2014more so than do the noisier leftists dominating social media. Biden aides also say he is best positioned to win over independents and swing states.\n\nThe tenor of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign echoes his nearly half-century in politics and an economic record placing him directly in the center of the Democratic Party. As a Delaware senator from 1973 to 2008, he accumulated an 86% lifetime Senate rating supporting legislation backed by the AFL-CIO and a 36% score from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both roughly average grades for Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThrough the 1990s, Mr. Biden was a faithful adherent of the Clinton agenda steering Democrats in a more market-oriented direction\u2014voting for a welfare overhaul that put new restrictions on beneficiaries, repealing Depression-Era bank regulations and supporting trade deals such as China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn the Obama years, he was a key player implementing an activist economic agenda that included a mammoth $800 billion stimulus bill, an auto-industry bailout, tougher Wall Street regulation and expanded government-funded health care.\n\nMr. Biden, then vice president, was introduced in 2010 by Roger Altman, a Treasury official in the Clinton administration and a co-founder of Evercore, a New York investment banking advisory firm.

He frames his vision in his personal experience as the son of a Chevrolet dealership manager who couldn\u2019t persuade a bank to lend the money to send Mr. Biden to an elite college.\n\n\u201cIn the Obama White House, Biden was the voice of the working man, sort of the executive branch\u2019s Bruce Springsteen, \u201d said Austan Goolsbee, who led the Obama Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHe told of an Oval Office debate over how financial-market moves would affect nearly all Americans through pensions or mutual funds: \u201cBiden raises his hand and says, \u2018I don\u2019t have any stock,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Goolsbee recalled.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s 2009 financial disclosure form shows him with modest stakes in about a half-dozen mutual funds at the time, each worth $15,000 or less. Mr. Biden\u2019s finances have improved since he left office. He and his wife, Jill, have reported earning $15.6 million over the past two years through books, teaching and speaking engagements.\n\nMr. Biden greeted supporters after launching his presidential campaign at a Teamsters Local\u2019s hall in Pittsburgh in late April. Photo: Justin Merriman/Bloomberg News\n\nMr. Biden gently berates elites in his party for focusing on the upper and lower classes but not those in the middle, a tendency he calls \u201cclass cluelessness.\u201d In the Obama administration, he dressed down officials as out of touch for proposing a child-care tax credit only for families making less than $75,000, and got them to raise the cutoff to $180,000, according to an aide involved.\n\nFor Mr. Biden, the middle class is linked closely to organized labor, and he has fostered deep ties with unions since his first Senate campaign in 1972. He launched his 2020 bid at a Pittsburgh Teamsters hall.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Can Joe Biden successfully appeal to his party\u2019s left wing and a general election audience at the same time? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn the Senate, he was a reliable sponsor for bills helping unions organize or raising the minimum wage. He was an early proponent of the $15 national minimum.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama praised a failing Rhode Island high school in March 2010 for firing all its teachers, Vice President Biden quietly quelled union protests by intervening to help get the teachers get their jobs back.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden was the person I vented to when we had conflicts with the Obama administration,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nIn contrast to rivals\u2019 grand themes\u2014Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cbig structural change,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019 \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d\u2014the Biden campaign focuses on nuts-and-bolts ways to ease middle-class economic anxieties. His proposals for health care and child care blend government funding with existing private-sector offerings, while other candidates lean more on government alternatives.\n\nSome would make four-year colleges free and wipe out existing student debt. Mr. Biden would triple funding for public schools in low-income areas and have the government fund education at two-year community colleges.\n\nThe Politics of Bigger Government Liberal proposals for more government taxing and spending are more popular with Democrats than the general electorate. All adults Democrats Medicare for all that want it, private health insurance remains an option GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA 70% 25% 90% 8% Medicare for all, replacing private health insurance GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA 41 54 64 31 Green New Deal GOOD IDEA GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA 63 32 86 8 Free tuition for public colleges/universities GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA 53 43 76 19 A new \u2018wealth tax\u2019 on the richest Americans GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA 62 34 88 9\n\nMore than other candidates, Mr. Biden remains concerned about government debt and deficits. He has at times over the years weighed solutions seen by fellow Democrats as taboo, periodically floating the idea of new restrictions on Social Security and Medicare. In 1995, he sided with Senate Republicans in their unsuccessful push for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\nBiden advisers say the campaign spends considerable time making sure his proposals are funded in ways that wouldn\u2019t increase the deficit. \u201cWe should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a mid-September debate. \u201cI lay out how I can pay.\u201d\n\nAn area where Mr. Biden has repeatedly broken with labor is in backing free-trade pacts, though he has tried to bridge the differences. He pushed Obama negotiators to sweeten the 2012 U.S.-Korea trade agreement for auto makers, winning a rare endorsement of the deal by the United Auto Workers.\n\nHe has long been skeptical about claims of economic gains from opening markets. But the onetime Foreign Relations Committee chairman has seen trade agreements as valuable tools for projecting American power and values. It was an argument he used in the unsuccessful push for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nIn the 2020 campaign, he straddles the TPP issue. He was asked during the July debate if he would rejoin the pact Mr. Trump abandoned. \u201cI\u2019d renegotiate\u201d for tougher labor and environmental rules, Mr. Biden said. Then he repeated a case he has long made for TPP: \u201cEither China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are.\u201d\n\nTrump backers see Mr. Biden\u2019s trade record as a vulnerability against a president who credits his political success in part to his attacks on the bipartisan establishment free-trade agenda. Mr. Biden is \u201cgoing to have to go into western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin defending a 40-year record of supporting globalization that\u2019s not defensible today,\u201d said former Trump aide Steve Bannon. \u201cTrump will fieldstrip him on this.\u201d\n\nLike most Democrats, Mr. Biden says he would seek to undo most of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, a move that would lead to higher rates for businesses and upper-income families. He has floated changes to capital-gains taxes\u2014raising the rate on households making over $1 million a year and, most significantly, ending heirs\u2019 ability to inherit assets without paying tax on gains accrued by the prior owner, known as \u201cstepped-up basis.\u201d\n\nHe is more restrained in his proposals than Mr. Sanders, who wants to tax a range of financial transactions, or Ms. Warren, who favors a wealth tax claiming 2% a year of individuals\u2019 assets above $50 million and a further 1% of assets above $1 billion.\n\nThat underscores a difference in how the candidates would address economic inequality. Mr. Biden focuses mainly on lifting the lower classes. Sens. Warren and Sanders see a need to do more to whack the upper class as well.\n\nSen.

Warren and Sanders, attacks \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d But he has a more complex approach to business. He represented what he calls \u201cthe corporate state,\u201d referring to Delaware laws making it the preferred location for incorporation. He wants to curb executives\u2019 shareholder focus by limiting stock buybacks. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan for big business goes much further. She would force large companies to let workers choose some directors and would break up Big Tech.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Biden broke with many fellow Democrats to champion an overhaul of bankruptcy laws to make it harder for debtors to wipe out their obligations. He said it was needed to curb abuse by debtors and keep interest rates low for middle-class families, and said he worked to soften the law for distressed households.\n\nMr. Biden promoted the bill over the objections of President Clinton, who vetoed it, and Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor leading a campaign against the measure. It later became law under President George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Biden took a tougher stance on the financial industry after the 2008 Lehman Brothers shock and financial crisis. He repudiated his 1999 vote to remove bank restrictions imposed by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act as \u201cthe worst vote I ever cast in my entire time in the U.S. Senate.\u201d He was a big supporter of Ms. Warren\u2019s successful push to create a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nHe also played an influential part in creating the Volcker rule restricting banks from speculative trading with their own money. \u201cIt could well have been labeled the Biden rule,\u201d former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said in 2016 while introducing a Biden speech.\n\nBiden supporters say that, unlike any of his rivals, he has a record of getting progressive policies implemented, albeit with significant compromises along the way. As vice president, Mr. Biden was regularly assigned to cut budget deals with congressional Republicans.\n\nLiberals bemoaned his concessions, such as expanding tax breaks on large estates. Biden aides cite measures they say he won in return, such as bigger middle-class tax breaks, higher income taxes on the rich and a budget framework that applied the same constraints to military spending as to domestic spending.\n\n\u201cI chose to work within the system, to make it better, to get things done for the least among us,\u201d Mr. Biden said during a July speech in Sumter, S.C.\n\n\u201cWas I wrong to do that?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nHow the Democratic Front-Runners Differ How candidates Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pledge to address major issues HEALTH CARE Biden: Expand Obamacare with Medicare-like public option.
