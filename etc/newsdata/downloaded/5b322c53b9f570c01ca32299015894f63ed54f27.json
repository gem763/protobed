So Why the Mystery?", "language": "en", "text": "October 3rd 2019 - Democratic presidential contender Senator Bernie Sanders hospitalized in Las Vegas, Nevada for treatment of a blocked artery. His campaign aides have said that he will appear at the next debate scheduled for October 15th. - File Photo by: zz/Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx 2016 6/23/16 Bernie Sanders gives his \"Where We Go From Here\" speech at \"A Future To Believe In\" rally at Town Hall in New York City. (NYC)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency will affect us,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a tweet from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday, hours after the 78-year-old Democratic candidate for president experienced one.\n\nSanders\u2019 emergency \u2014 the sudden onset of chest pain known as angina \u2014 is one that thousands of other Americans experience each year. Sanders\u2019 discomfort occurred at a campaign event Tuesday night. Because it signaled acute heart trouble, the senator went to the hospital where doctors implanted two stents in one of the coronary arteries that nourish the heart.\n\nDoctors often release patients who undergo such procedures in a day or two. Sanders remains in the hospital, and his campaign has closely guarded pertinent details about his heart condition and treatment, raising questions about the extent of his health issues.\n\nAmong other things, Sanders has not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate Oct. 15.\n\nWith respect to release of health information, President Donald Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d Closer to the 2016 election date, Trump\u2019s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient\u2019s health.\n\nIn 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president\u2019s medical files after The New York Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Trump in \u201cvery good health\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.\n\nThe health questions hang over Sanders in part because he would become the nation\u2019s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in U.S. hospitals, it is puzzling why he has not released more details. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues.\n\nNormally, \u201crecovery from stent placement is very quick,\u201d and patients usually go home a day or two after the procedure, said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms of office. Reiner is not involved in Sanders\u2019 care.\n\nOlder patients and those who experience complications like heart rhythm abnormalities, heart attacks or heart failure may remain in the hospital longer. A patient\u2019s condition usually determines the length of stay.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders\u2019 doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease.\n\nTuesday\u2019s episode of angina appears to be his first such incident. Doctors often refer to such heart issues as new onset, or unstable, angina and usually describe an event like Sanders\u2019 as acute coronary syndrome.\n\nSanders\u2019 status as a presidential candidate may influence his care and possibly lead to his staying in the hospital a bit longer than usual for patients with his ailment. Although doctors say they care for VIPs as they do any other patient, they may deviate from the norm out of caution or if complications occur. A danger in VIP care is a tendency to do too little or too much for a patient.\n\nIn cases like Sanders\u2019, doctors perform a standard procedure known as cardiac catheterization. In it, they thread thin tubes into chambers of the heart and inject a radio-opaque dye to produce X-rays outlining the coronary arteries. For Sanders, the procedure revealed blockage in one artery; he has not said which artery. Doctors would then remove the blockage, which is usually caused by deposits of fatty substances, by inflating a tiny balloon in a tube to squash them. Implanting the stents aims at preventing development of scar tissue and recurrence of the blockage.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- \"None of us know when a medical emergency will affect us,\" Sen.
