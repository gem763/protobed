I would basically pray for a common cold every year, so I could bunker down on the couch with Ribena and have mum feed me snacks all day which I watched the absolutely demented Australian TV shows that air during the day.\n\nThese days, kids have Netflix and Stan to keep them mentally stimulated on a sickie. We didn\u2019t have that luxury \u2013 we had free-to-air and maybe Foxtel if you had parents who weren\u2019t cheapskates (god, how long I begged for Foxtel).\n\nBecause of this, our options were limited to whatever TV stations felt stay-at-home mums felt like watching. Basically cooking shows, unhinged reality TV, soaps and talk shows. Here\u2019s the most memorable.\n\nPSA: when I say Australian TV shows I mean shows that aired in Australia when we were kids (not necessarily Aussie shows, of which there were only a few for daytime slots).\n\n1. Toddlers & Tiaras\n\nToddlers & Tiaras was FUCKED, you guys. We were basically watching a bunch of tiny kids being puppeteered by their parents so they could vicariously live through their fame. One most memorable episode I watched was when a twin, I think, was clearly being bullied by her OWN MUM, who favoured the other twin. In the end the bullied twin won the comp which was supremely satisfying. But also what became of her, you know? Nothing good, I assume.\n\nThis was one of those TLC shows on Foxtel that was re-run every hour on the hour through the day, and while in hindsight it was truly a terrible thing to be watching, it also had a lot of makeovers and fashion parades that drew my kid-brain in.\n\n2. Ready, Steady, Cook\n\nWait wait wait wait. Let\u2019s all just enjoy something for one second.\n\nSorry, I had to.\n\nAnyway, this was in my opinion THE best daytime TV show. It was an hour long, it was fucking exciting, and it involved watching food being made, a penchant I\u2019ve dragged into my adult life by watching re-runs of Man Vs. Food when I\u2019m hungover.\n\nI always wanted to be in the audience for this show and I never managed to convince Mum to let me.\n\n3. Huey\u2019s Cooking Adventures\n\nFuck all the fancy cooking shows, Huey (his name is Iain Hewitson if you weren\u2019t aware, which tickles me for some reason. Iain.) was all about exotic fare without the complicated recipes. He also liked to wear suspenders all the time which made him look like Food Santa.\n\n4. 19 Kids And Counting\n\nThis show, like other TLC beb Toddlers & Tiaras, saw no shortage of controversy. Let\u2019s start with this family that was just popping out kids willy nilly in a world that was, even back then, very aware of how unsustainable it was to have a massive amount of children.\n\nThen there was the incident in which one of the older brothers allegedly molested his younger sister.\n\nBut back when we were kids and that info wasn\u2019t made public, let alone on our radar, the fucked up yet \u201cwholesome\u201d Duggar family was primo sick day viewing. There was always some niche disaster or triumph each week, from another family with 4,000 kids coming over for a cookout to coverage of a date between one of the kids and some paramour, in which holding hands was the pinnacle of sexiness (cue creepy as fuck hand stroking, oh god get it out of my brain).\n\n5. Mornings With Kerri-Anne\n\nThese days she\u2019s known for being controversial and sexist/racist as fuck, but did you know in 2010 Kerri-Anne also came under fire for referring to women who socialised with footballers as \u201cstrays\u201d? This, by the way, was while discussing sexual assault allegations. Sigh.\n\nClearly she was always probbo, but if you had parents who watched 9\u2019s brekkie TV then you automatically ended up watching the unending infomercials and other boring shit on Kerri-Anne, usually because you CBF changing the station.\n\n6. Oprah\n\nOBVIOUSLY \u2013 every child off sick from school in Australia since the dawn of time (basically) has watched far too many hours of Oprah. Whether it was interviews with old person celebs you had NFI about or frankly didn\u2019t care for, or \u2013 in the weirdest episodes for kids \u2013 some deep dive on a self-help author\u2019s book, Oprah was on smack-bang at 1pm, primo lunch hour which meant Mum controlled the telly.\n\n7. Days Of Our Lives / Young & The Restless\n\nTwo shows that were so similar you could honestly be an avid viewer of one and still mistake the other for it, DOOL (as my mum called it, because she was a superfan) and Young & The Restless took up the 1-3pm daytime primetime slots with their inane drama.\n\nHonest to god, you have to watch these shows for a month for there to be ANY plot progression, and every episode has the characters giving so much information when they speak that you can wholly follow whatever drama is going down with ease. This made them perfect for sick day viewing \u2013 also the fact they were a bit spicy and kind of off-limits for kids.\n\nMy favourite moment was when Marlena was possessed by the devil.\n\n8. Landline\n\nThe most chaotic energy on a sick day was to wind up watching Landline, the report-based series from ABC that was literally just for rural based folks interested in local stories.\n\nI feel like every single episode was about cows, but I also exclusively watched this on sick days from the ages of 8-12.\n\n9. The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n\nEllen was like the cool-Oprah \u2013 more modern, more relevant celebs and just generally funnier. But you only got to watch Ellen when mum pissed off to the shops or whatever, because Mum\u2019s fave was Oprah.\n\n10. Judge Judy\n\nThe queen of daytime TV. Judge Judy was this insanely boring TV show you\u2019d watch in the arvo, which then dramatically became exciting when someone started screaming at their cheating spouse or telling their sister she was a ho.\n\nWho knew in our adult life Judy\u2019s disdain for all human beings would become such a personal mood?", "description": "Australian TV shows - by which we mean tv on in Oz - during the daytime hours is completely insane stuff, friends.
