He said he had attempted suicide a few times before first visiting the BraveHearts farm in 2016.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, a rocket struck Mr. Hedlund as he was walking down a mountain. He suffered a back injury from the attack that required him to temporarily use a wheelchair and cane. Mr. Hedlund was also going through a divorce as he recovered from his injuries.\n\nIn 2015, he was medically discharged from the Army, but struggled to transition back to civilian life.\n\nDue to his time in the military, Mr. Hedlund said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), isolating himself from others while drinking alcohol and abusing pills on a daily basis.\n\nIt was after his mother took him to visit the BraveHearts farm in Illinois that Mr. Hedlund started to recover.\n\n\u201cTo me, the horses were almost a stepping stone \u2014 communicating to them first before actually being able to communicate with people and interact appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me a purpose I took away from myself. They gave me a freedom I took away from myself.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Hedlund acknowledged equine therapy might not be for everyone, he said veterans should give it a try and ride horseback at least three times, and if riding horseback doesn\u2019t help, they should try something else instead, he said.\n\nKim Ruocco, vice president for suicide prevention for Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, said she is glad the Trail to Zero ride is bringing attention to alternative therapies for veterans and that participants in the campaign are acting as \u201cbeacons of hope\u201d for others.\n\nEquine therapy is just one of many types of therapies popping up to support veterans, Ms. Ruocco said. Aside from Veterans Affairs and local clinicians, she said there are veteran centers that offer private counseling, a national crisis line and peer-to-peer support lines, reunions for specific military units and intensive clinical treatment programs.\n\nMs. Ruocco said suicide rates among veterans are higher than the general population, noting rates among older veterans and those who served in the Vietnam era are especially high.\n\n\u201cI think awareness campaigns alone we have to be careful with,\u201d Ms. Ruocco said. \u201cIf we just talk about the numbers and how many people are dying, that could increase hopelessness and helplessness in those who are suffering. So we really have to balance the awareness of the problem with hope, healing and some good real examples of that.\u201d\n\nWilliam Mercurio, an instructor for BraveHearts and a Vietnam veteran who also participated in the Trail to Zero ride, said the 20 veterans lost to suicide each day is a \u201ctragedy that needs to be paid attention to.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, what we want to do is reduce that number to zero,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mercurio, who served as a combat engineer for the U.S. Army and lost his son to a fentanyl overdose a couple years ago, said he was \u201con the brink himself.\u201d\n\nBut horses saved him, he said, adding he is certain equine therapy can help others like him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never too far gone,\u201d Mr. Hedlund said, commenting on the vast number of times he had thought he had \u201cscraped the bottom of the barrel.\u201d\n\nThe District was just the first stop for the Trail to Zero campaign. Later this year veterans are scheduled to conduct 20-mile tours in New York City, Chicago and Houston.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
