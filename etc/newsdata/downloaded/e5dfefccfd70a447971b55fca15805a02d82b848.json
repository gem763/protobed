Facebook News will likely function differently in different markets around the world depending on regulation and user preferences.\n\nThe new tab will help Facebook on a number of fronts, including tackling the circulation of fake news by providing a separate area of the social media app for news from 200 approved publishers, such as The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. It is curated by both humans with a background in journalism and algorithms.\n\nBloomberg, which is participating in the product, reported Facebook is paying some publishers between $US1 million and $US3 million to put their articles in Facebook News, which may alleviate some of the tension between the social media giant and publishers. It is not known exactly which publishers were being paid or how much. Controversially, alt-right news website Breitbart, known for misleading stories in the US, is on Facebook's publisher list. A Facebook spokesperson told CNN Breitbart was not among the publishers being paid for its content.\n\n\"On a financial basis, this is going to be the first time we\u2019re forming long-term stable, relationships and partnerships with a lot of publishers,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.\n\nRobert Thomson, News Corp chief executive. AAP\n\n\"For the first time we\u2019re making multi-year financial commitments, and hopefully helping to make a long-term sustainable business model and way we can be in business together.\"\n\nMr Thomson has been an outspoken critic of Facebook and Google on a range of issues, but on Friday praised the new initiative.\n\n\"It is a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments. Of itself, it begins to change the terms of trade for quality journalism, both in establishing the principle of payment and in allowing news organisations a clearer opportunity to generate advertising revenue on their terms,\" Mr Thomson said.\n\n\"This announcement is an important step on the road, it\u2019s far from the end of the journey, but it\u2019s certainly a moment to ponder and recognise.\"\n\nFacebook's move comes as the Australian government mulls its response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry. One of the main gripes of Australian media companies articulated through the inquiry was the inability to build sustainable business models around Facebook and Google, which together account for the lion's share of digital advertising in Australia and the world.\n\nIn its submission to the Treasury last month, News Corp urged the government to establish a legal framework that would prohibit digital platforms from using any news publisher's content and collecting any data generated from its use \"unless all news publishers (or at least the major ones) have negotiated and entered into agreements with that digital platform\".", "description": "The social media giant has launched its News tab, and says internet platforms have a responsibility to help fund journalism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4898%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_483%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/38b4d710084f7e94e93ffa4d2d1810c01011a3c5", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
