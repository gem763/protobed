He went middle because I thought he was going to go high. Killed our day. I don\u2019t know. Should have run fourth probably. Instead 19th.\u201d\n\nSmithley was making his 12th start in the Cup series. He has one top five in 133 starts across the Xfinity and truck series, and Busch questioned his credentials for running in NASCAR\u2019s premier series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the top echelon of motorsports, and we\u2019ve got guys who have never won Late Model races running on the racetrack,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic. They don\u2019t know where to go. What else do you do?\u201d\n\nSmithley told NASCAR.com\u2019s Zack Albert after the race that Busch has \u201cnever been in the position we\u2019ve been in, so he doesn\u2019t know how that goes.\u201d Albert also talked with Joey Gase, whose 38th-place car (which was 18 laps down) also seemed to impede Busch in the closing laps.\n\nStory continues\n\nCaught up with Gase and Smithley in the garage after their late-race run-ins with Kyle Busch. Their response to hearing that Busch was critical of them: Full story/comments to come. #NASCAR | #NASCARPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/Ol51ODSOtb \u2014 Zack Albert (@zack_albert) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore speaking with Kligerman, Busch made a brief visit to a postrace media bullpen provided by NASCAR. The 2015 series champion tersely answered eight questions, capping it with a \u201cI\u2019m just here so I don\u2019t get fined\u201d in a tribute to NFL star Marshawn Lynch (who happened to be the honorary pace car driver Sunday).\n\nKyle Busch, obviously quite angry with the day, channeled his inner Marshawn Lynch \u2014 who he swapped helmets with earlier \u2014 said \u201cI\u2019m just here so I don\u2019t get fined.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Gluck (@jeff_gluck) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBusch, whose rebound came after taking a waveraound on a Lap 182 caution and then getting back on pit sequence because of a yellow on Lap 189, at least will carry a solid 36-point lead into Richmond Raceway, where he is the defending winner of the second race in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nBy virtue of winning the regular-season title, Busch has a 45-point playoff margin (15 points more than teammate Denny Hamlin) that he will carry throughout the playoffs. It makes Busch a virtual cinch to advance, though he hardly found solace in that Sunday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic to have to lean on insurance,\u201d Busch said. \u201cMy premiums are going to go up.\u201d\n\nHeld my line\u20262 cars got around \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/pZCRb4uFay \u2014 Garrett Smithley (@GarrettSmithley) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nTop tier drivers get hired by top tier teams. Try winning\u2026 a lot\u2026 and u have a better shot of getting hired. https://t.co/Vi9iPuckA9 \u2014 Kyle Busch (@KyleBusch) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAs long as there are \u201cunchartered\u201d teams, the model makes them strapped for cash and they cannot afford to pay an experienced guy what they\u2019re worth. They have to take anyone that can pass NASCAR\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d process and has enough to pay the tire bill for that week. \u2014 Corey LaJoie (@CoreyLaJoie) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely!! Agreed! On track awareness is the point. Some lapped cars are always a moving target. I was told the 52 was running high, so I went middle cause I couldn\u2019t follow the 24 when he went low cause u can\u2019t follow anyone in these cars! https://t.co/8lpLRrwQlw \u2014 Kyle Busch (@KyleBusch) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n", "description": "Joe Gibbs Racing driver angry with Garrett Smithley after late-race collision negates a top-five comeback at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aywfJ6EnDe_zoHhTt_xMDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Iao7IfkJ.2TWFggC1BlW_A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/18cc38beca14ee80c5acccd5eefbdfd6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
