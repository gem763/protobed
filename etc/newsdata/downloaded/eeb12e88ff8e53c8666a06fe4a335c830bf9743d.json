Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, about free speech \u2014 and it went pretty much as could be expected. Explaining the concept of American freedom of speech to a socialist is about as fruitful as commanding a brick wall to move.\n\nBut as far as teaching moments go, this is an important point in American politics.\n\nThe Zuckerberg-Ocasio-Cortez exchange, as captured by C-SPAN, shows how pervasive, and even persuasive, are the lies those on the left tell in order to bring about their leftist designs.\n\nThe setting was the House Financial Services Committee. The background was a discussion of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook\u2019s policing policy as it pertains to political posts and politician-tied advertising.\n\nBut the important portion of the Q&A began with this, from Ocasio-Cortez: \u201cUmm, you announced recently that the official policy of Facebook now allows politicians to pay to spread disinformation, umm, in 2020 elections and in the future. I just want to know how far I can push this, umm, in the next year.\u201d\n\nThis is Deceit Number One \u2014 that Facebook\u2019s political advertisement policy specifically allows for the spread of \u201cdisinformation.\u201d That\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s interpretation of ads she disagrees with \u2014 specifically, ads that paint the left in a negative light.\n\nFor the record, the actual Facebook policy allows for \u201cads about social issues, elections or politics.\u201d\n\nLet the Ocasio-Cortez theatrics begin.\n\n\u201cUnder your policy, you know, using Census data as well, could I pay to target predominantly black ZIP codes and advertise to them the incorrect election date?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nNo, congresswoman.\n\n\u201cBut you said you\u2019re not going to fact-check,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nNo, congresswoman \u2014 Facebook\u2019s policy prohibits ads that incite violence or that cause harm, such as voter suppression.\n\n\u201cSo there is some thresh-hold where you will fact-check political advertisements, is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d she asked.\n\nYes, congresswoman.\n\n\u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d she asked.\n\nOcasio-Cortez continued: \u201cI mean if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n\nOK, congresswoman.\n\n\u201cSo, you don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do that,\u201d she said. Pause for effect. Swoop hair and turn head, stern expression on face.\n\n\u201cUmm, do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\u201d she asked.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s response: \u201cWell congresswoman, I think lying is bad, and I think that if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That\u2019s different from it being \u2026 in our position the right thing to do to prevent your constituents \u2026 from seeing that you had lied.\u201d\n\nBeware, America. Zuckerberg is quite right here.\n\nPay attention to where Ocasio-Cortez is leading.\n\n\u201cSo we can \u2014 so you won\u2019t take down lies, or you will take down lies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a pretty simple yes or no. I\u2019m not talking about spin, I\u2019m talking about actual disinformation.\u201d\n\nAnd from Zuckerberg: \u201cIn a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for \u2026 and judge their character for themselves.\u201d\n\nAgain, Zuckerberg is right. It\u2019s transparency America needs \u2014 not government controls.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez interrupted: \u201cSo, you won\u2019t take them down. You may flag that it\u2019s wrong, but you won\u2019t take it down.\u201d\n\nAs if it were Facebook\u2019s job to censor political ads.\n\nAs if were Facebook\u2019s position in society to do the government\u2019s bidding and censor political ads. As if it were government\u2019s right to intrude on political speech of private companies and private citizens.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s questioning shows a chilling march toward government-sponsored, government-pressed, even government-mandated censorship of the First Amendment \u2014 and she\u2019s deftly going after Facebook, a company that\u2019s come under conservative fire, to accomplish this design. She\u2019s counting on conservative ire with Facebook to blind conservatives to the fact she\u2019s kinking the First Amendment.\n\nBut in the hearing of Zuckerberg versus Ocasio-Cortez, it\u2019s Zuckerberg who\u2019s right. Political advertisements are constitutionally protected forms of speech. The government has no business sticking its nose into this area.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, wide-eyed and with feigned-innocence, was simply laying a snare for Zuckerberg that would open the door for government control of political advertisements \u2014 of political speech \u2014 on social media.\n\nJust because she\u2019s set the snare doesn\u2019t mean the American people have to fall into it, though.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
