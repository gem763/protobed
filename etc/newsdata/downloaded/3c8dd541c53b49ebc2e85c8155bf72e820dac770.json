But when they did cut through it was first-phase, set-piece play that saw Adam Hasting dummy and slice through to dot down. It was foot on the gas from there.\n\nThe Glasgow fly-half was at the double minutes later. Sliding right, in the middle of the park, he dinked the ball through with the outside of his foot, chased, hacked it on again, and as Vasily Artemyev slipped as he chased across his own in-goal, the ten touched it down.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

George Horne\u2019s intercept try mere metres from the opposition line was a sure sign that the Russians were totally outmatched. The Bears go home with their heads held high having shown exemplary effort against Japan and Ireland. But they were completely physically overpowered.\n\nEvery time the Scots sent a raking kick into the 22, you could sense the Russians\u2019 power bar leaching further into the red.\n\nScotland were able to make changes too \u2013 not exactly laying up, but taking off Fraser Brown after 30 minutes for Magnus Bradbury.\n\nThe bonus-point score came a deep sigh into the second half, with a slaloming run from the effervescent wing Darcy Graham ending with the simplest of finishes for George Horne.\n\nThe numbers added up. The fifth try was George Turner\u2019s fifth in nine caps while Tommy Seymour got the sixth to take his international haul to 20, leapfrogging Stuart Hogg to sit in on the all-time try scorers list. Horne scampered in from distance for his hat-trick before the hour mark and had a fourth chopped off after a worldie of a move that started with Adam Hastings popping the ball from the deck to a charging WP Nel.\n\nCaptain for the day John Barclay nabbed a try under the posts, while squad captain Stuart McInally finished off a sweeping score in the corner.\n\nWith the gong already sounded, a galloping Tommy Seymour set Hastings free for what would have been his hat-trick score, but referee Wayne Barnes \u2013 a replacement for Mathieu Raynal, who had to pull out because of illness \u2013 chalked it off for a forward pass. The fly-half will be happy enough with his 26-point haul regardless. And only Chris Paterson has scored more conversions in a Scottish Test, with 11.\n\nHastings finished up as player of the match.\n\nThere will be a much sterner Test against Japan. Defeating the hosts and not allowing them to get a bonus point will see Scotland progress. However this has been a tournament of blips and enigmas, much to the joy of neutrals around the world.\n\nCan Japan repeat the heroics of their win against Ireland? With updates on that contest to come from World Rugby, Pool A is balanced on a knife edge.\n\nThere won\u2019t be many fingernails left when we finally wrap up the group stages.", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis still has its havoc to wreak on Japan\u00a0and it\u2019s World Cup\u00a0fixtures list, but Scotland\u00a0have kept themselves in the race going into the final match of Pool A after hammering Russia\u00a061-0 in Shizuoka.", "authors": ["Alan Dymock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/11/Scotland-rugby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
