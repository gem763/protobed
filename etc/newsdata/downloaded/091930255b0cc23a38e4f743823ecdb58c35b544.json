Without Smith around, that is just not going to happen.\n\nThis is not simply because Smith will no longer be the nearly-lone source of facts on a platform made up of mostly pro-Trump propaganda. His audience was not nearly large enough to make a significant difference in the outcome of Trump\u2019s coming impeachment trial.\n\nWhat is far more impactful about Smith leaving is that it removes an extremely important level of cover for anyone else at Fox News who might have had an inclination to buck the \u201cstate-run\u201d format there.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Ziegler", "Mediaite.Com Opinion Shepard-Smiths-Sudden-Departure-From-Fox-News-Is-Likely-A-Bigger-Deal-Than-You-Realize"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
