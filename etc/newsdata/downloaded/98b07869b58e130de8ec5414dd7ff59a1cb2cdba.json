Optimism that President Donald Trump\u2019s phase one trade deal with China would get completed, an extension to Brexit until January and better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings results have helped send risk assets higher, breaking the blue-chip index out of the holding pattern it had been in for the better part of the last three months.\n\nProspects of still-easier monetary policy have also given traders a reason to buy stocks. As of Tuesday morning, markets priced in a more than 96% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark interest rates a third time this year on Wednesday, the second session of their October rate-setting meeting.\n\n\u201cThe overall tone still looks positive, and perhaps a bit too much so, ahead of the FOMC decision tomorrow. Investors looking to climb aboard the rally train today and tomorrow will need to be aware of the poor performance of equities in the wake of Fed decisions this year, and with indicators like put/call ratios already close to \u2018greed\u2019 rather than \u2018fear\u2019 readings, a bout of volatility to the downside cannot be ruled out,\u201d Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cStill, as earnings season continues to deliver a healthy series of \u2018beats\u2019 any weakness still looks like a buying opportunity,\u201d he added.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, companies comprising just over half of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization had reported third-quarter results. These earnings have beaten expectations by 3.6%, and 71% of companies topped their own profit expectations, according to a report from Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Golub. This compares to 5.4% and 71%, respectively, over the past three years, he added.\n\nSTOCKS: Alphabet earnings disappoint, Boeing CEO heads to Capitol Hill\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted third-quarter profit that missed consensus expectations as increased spending to diversify the company\u2019s revenue streams outside of its key internet advertising business crimped margins. Earnings per share of $10.12 were short of expectations for $12.35, while revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $33.01 billion was ahead of the $32.72 billion consensus. Alphabet reported after market close Monday.\n\nWhile advertising still comprises more than 80% of total Google segment revenues, Alphabet has upped its investments into other initiatives like cloud computing and machine learning. The company\u2019s $13.8 billion in quarterly operating expenses were driven primarily by head count growth in research and development and sales, particularly in cloud, CFO Ruth Porat said during a call with analysts. Total headcount jumped 21% to about 114,100 over last year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) beat the Street\u2019s expectations for third-quarter earnings but posted disappointing guidance for the current quarter as the United Auto Workers\u2019 more than month-long strike took a toll on the automaker. GM said it expects adjusted EPS of as much as $4.80 for the full-year, down sharply from previous guidance for as much as $7. GM also underscored a $1.0 billion negative impact to GM North America\u2019s adjusted EBIT as a result of the strike during the quarter. About two weeks of vehicle production were lost during the period, GM said.\n\nDespite the headwinds, GM\u2019s profit during the third-quarter topped estimates. GM delivered adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share in the third quarter, or 41 cents ahead of expectations. Revenues of $35.5 billion were just short of Bloomberg-compiled estimates for $35.7 billion.", "description": "U.S. stocks retreated slightly after closing at record highs Monday, as investors searched for fresh catalysts to push equities higher.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.dypbjWMuyosJYDUjfEvgw--~B/aD00NDIyO3c9NjYzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/39bc45a0-fa48-11e9-b77a-36f826f445ad", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
