When he said he had no address, he was turned away.\n\n\"I told them that I have an address in Hokkaido [Japan's northern island, hundreds of miles from Tokyo], but they still denied me entry,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cleaning up in Kawasaki, Japan, after the typhoon\n\nThe man said he instead spent the night under an umbrella beneath the eaves of a building.\n\n\"I wanted them to allow me into the facility because the wind was strong and it was raining,\" he said.\n\nAnother homeless man was turned away later that afternoon.\n\nWhat was the reaction?\n\nAs news spread on social media, there was outrage at the shelter's decision.\n\n\"Is this a country that's going to host the Olympics in Tokyo? [in 2020]\" asked one Twitter user. \"People from abroad would see this and think this is a terrible country.\"\n\nThe San'ya Workers' Welfare Centre, a charity, responded by opening as a shelter on Saturday night.\n\nBut others were less sympathetic, suggesting \"smelly\" or \"mentally ill\" homeless people should only be allowed into shelters if there was a separate space.\n\n\"If you claim your rights, do your duties first,\" said one Twitter user. \"Can you sleep next to a stinking person?\" asked another.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Shinzo Abe speaking in parliament earlier this month\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe was asked about the case in parliament and said \"evacuation centres should let anyone in who has come to evacuate\".\n\n\"We will look into the facts and take appropriate measures,\" he added.\n\nThe Taito ward said it would review its procedures to help people without addresses in the ward.\n\n'A visible libertarian streak'\n\nAnalysis by Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo\n\nMost of 1,126 homeless people in Tokyo dwell in parks, on the streets, and by the river.\n\nRarely do they mingle with the rest of the population - but the typhoon brought them to the forefront of our consciousness.\n\nOn Saturday night, as the torrential rain and huge gusts of wind were coursing through Tokyo, word began to spread about the shelter in Taito.\n\nMany people were immediately outraged. On the other hand, some voiced concerns about hygiene, while others were concerned about the homeless people's mental condition.\n\nSome were simply scared to share the same space with them.\n\nSocial media also showed up the libertarian streak that has become quite visible in Japanese public opinion. Some said the homeless shouldn't benefit from public services because they don't pay taxes.\n\nMany rejected this - not just in terms of human decency - but also pragmatically, as the homeless do pay taxes when they buy something.\n\nHow many homeless people are there in Japan?\n\nAccording to a government survey in January, there were 4,555 homeless people (4,253 male, 171 female, 131 unknown) in Japan.\n\nThat was 422 people (8.5%) fewer than the previous fiscal year.\n\nAmong all the 47 prefectures, Tokyo had the most (1,126 people), Osaka was second (1,064), followed by Kanagawa (899).\n\nAccording to the Tokyo government survey from the same period, the Shinjuku ward had the most homeless people (117 people, seven fewer than a year before).\n\nThe Taito ward was second with 61 people (69 fewer than the previous year).", "description": "The case has caused huge debate in Japan - and now the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has weighed in.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qyh5g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
