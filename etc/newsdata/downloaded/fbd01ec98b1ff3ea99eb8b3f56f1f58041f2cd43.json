Stier said he told the FBI about the incident during Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, but the incident was not investigated.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should start \u201csuing people for libel,\u201d or the \u201cJustice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\nThe president added, \u201cWhen does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nTrump had earlier warned the \u201cLameStream Media\u201d had treated him horribly. \u201cThey want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201d\n\nReaction to the Times allegations was divided along party lines. Sunday morning, Democratic presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that she still opposed Kavanaugh and the process under which he was sworn in.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose him, based on his views on the executive power which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cMy concern here is that the process was a sham.\u201d\n\nShortly after Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in July 2018 to fill the post left by retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, allegations of sexual misconduct started to emerged. Christine Blasey Ford, a Palo Alto University professor of psychology, later testified in a Senate confirmation hearing that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a house party in the early 1980s when they were in high school. Ramirez and another woman came forward at that time.\n\nKavanaugh denied all allegations. The new allegation was the first made by a male student who witnessed the alleged misconduct.", "description": "The president said the Justice Department should come to the rescue of the high court judge after a NYT story about a new accusation of sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_94/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568554166/RTS26ADV_djv30w", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
