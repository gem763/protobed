Demographics are shifting, economies are evolving, and technology is advancing faster than ever before. These changes demand a shift in our way of thinking about work, particularly the role of education and skills development.\n\nAs of August 2019, more than 15 million men and women across the EU were unemployed, and the youth unemployment rate was above 14 percent[1]. In many cases, this is not due to a lack of job availability, but due in part to a lack of basic skills needed to acquire a job. While there is a growing demand for advanced skills in areas such as technology, the reality is that many workers lack the fundamental business and soft skills required in today\u2019s workplace. In fact, according to the OECD Skills for Jobs Database, after skills in technology, the greatest shortage in skills is in the \u201cjudgment and decision-making skills and communication and verbal abilities\u201d category[2]. Based on the importance of these skills in my own career journey and what I have witnessed throughout my time at McDonald\u2019s in Austria, Belgium, and France, this is something that particularly resonates with me. It is an area in which I believe companies like McDonald\u2019s can make a significant impact.\n\nIn Austria, our goal is to offer the best executive training program in the food service industry in the country and to double the number of apprenticeships we offer by 2025.\n\nI began my career at McDonald\u2019s as a restaurant trainee manager in France in 1985. Together with the restaurant manager, I was responsible for maintaining customer and employee satisfaction to ensure smooth operations. My time in the restaurant taught me many of the fundamental skills I believe are key to success in today\u2019s workplace, and in the workplace of the future. The problem solving, innovative thinking, communication, and leadership skills I built in the restaurant have supported me throughout my career, from restaurant manager to managing director of the Austrian market. Most importantly, my time in the restaurant taught me the joy of working with, and for, other people.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is a people business. Together with our franchisees, we have a longstanding commitment to providing training, education, and career opportunities. As we consider the skills needed to thrive in today\u2019s workforce and in the future of work, we are continuously improving the quality, methods, and focus of our training. In Austria, our goal is to offer the best executive training program in the food service industry in the country and to double the number of apprenticeships we offer by 2025. In turn, we\u2019ll attract the talent we need to run great restaurants.\n\nI am proud that today, we are joining our McDonald\u2019s colleagues in other European countries in a commitment to offer 45,000 apprenticeships by 2025. Last year, McDonald\u2019s Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiaries and participating franchisees in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the U.K. joined the European Alliance for Apprenticeships, led by the European Commission. This year, Austria is proud to stand with our colleagues in France and Denmark in joining the alliance.\n\nI am proud that today, we are joining our McDonald\u2019s colleagues in other European countries in a commitment to offer 45,000 apprenticeships by 2025.\n\nI believe apprenticeships can play a pivotal role in providing these fundamental business skills necessary for long-term success. By combining on-the-job training with formal study, apprentices can build the foundational skills that translate across industries and time. Apprenticeships also play a role in helping workforce transitions, bridging the gap between school and work for younger people, and offering upskilling and reskilling opportunities to support older and returning workers.\n\nIn our three-year Specialist in Foodservice Industry apprenticeship, for example, apprentices take extensive management and leadership courses to ensure they build the interpersonal skills necessary to progress, in McDonald\u2019s and beyond. These courses are supplemented by business classes on topics such as quality assurance, human resources, marketing, warehousing and logistics, and purchasing. An extended four-year apprenticeship also offers the opportunity to earn a high school diploma, all while maintaining a secure job and earning a fair wage.\n\nI believe so strongly in the power of apprenticeships to develop critical leadership skills, that we promise every McDonald\u2019s Austria apprentice they will have the opportunity to join management in three years.\n\nThrough ongoing training, focused competency management, and a clear commitment to recruitment from within, our goal is always to further our employees\u2019 careers. However, we know that McDonald\u2019s is often just the first stop on their career journey. That\u2019s why we offer a suite of learning resources to meet the needs of our employees at every stage of their career path and to ensure they are equipped for long-term success.\n\nI believe so strongly in the power of apprenticeships to develop critical leadership skills, that we promise every McDonald\u2019s Austria apprentice they will have the opportunity to join management in three years.\n\nIn Austria, restaurant employees are required to participate in ongoing training and can take advantage of additional learning opportunities, such as German language courses and a barista certification from the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe. We also offer courses in leadership, IT, recruiting, and process optimization, among others. As we consider the future of work, we believe it is important to help our employees develop a broad skillset, rooted in the fundamentals of dedication, ambition, and open-mindedness.\n\nAs a leader at McDonald\u2019s, my view is that just talking is not enough. True change requires action. If we continue to move forward and provide people with the opportunities and support needed to learn, grow, and develop, I am confident we can build positive, productive, and meaningful opportunities for all, and continue to shape the future leaders of McDonald\u2019s.\n\nAbout Isabelle: Isabelle Kuster has been managing director of McDonald\u2019s Austria since 2017.
