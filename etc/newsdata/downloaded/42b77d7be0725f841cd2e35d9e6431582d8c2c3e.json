According to the B\u00e9same Cosmetics founder, however, 1920s Hollywood propelled the United States from a culture of very little makeup to what would be the omnipresence of cosmetics and a billion-dollar market we see today.\n\n\u201cSo when we actually started making motion pictures in Hollywood and started to have actresses wearing makeup \u2026 then the looks that they were sporting, [and] wearing makeup, became a more popular, acceptable look,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cAnd that translated into being worn by more women.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nFlappers further influenced how women wore cosmetics with looks that included dark makeup around the eyes and a defined shape in the lips aptly called a \u201cCupid\u2019s Bow,\u201d according to Hernandez. She added that the look was characterized by a pointed upper lip and then a much smaller lip outline on the bottom.\n\nWhile makeup production decreased during World War II, cosmetics saw a major rebound in the 1950s. Hernandez told Fox News that it was due to the \u201ckind of explosion of women wanting to marry, be attractive to the opposite sex, and have kids when men got back from the war.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nHernandez explained that more cosmetics began to hit the market on the heels of World War II due to the prosperity of manufacturing. She added that the ultra-feminine makeup complemented soft pastel colors, the cinched-waist dresses, pointed bras, and big, flowy skirts.\n\n\u201cThe lips became more voluptuous and larger as we moved on into the 50s and the eyebrows also became thicker and more defined, as well as the eyeliner which became really more of the cat eyeliner, which was thicker and more pronounced,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on women to look a certain way, and to kind of never be really comfortable in yourself. You always had to be playing the role of the perfect wife so you couldn't really be off.\u201d\n\nTo learn how cosmetics transformed during the 60s and beyond, watch the interview above for more with B\u00e9same Cosmetics founder and makeup historian Gabriela Hernandez.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEmily DeCiccio is a video producer and reporter for Fox News Digital Originals.
