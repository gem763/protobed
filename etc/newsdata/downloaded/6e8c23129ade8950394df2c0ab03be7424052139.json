In the annual showdown in the Cotton Bowl between old, bitter rivals, the No. 5-ranked Sooners stuffed No. 11 Texas, winning 34-27. Oklahoma\u2019s defense was the difference in a game in which the Sooners were essentially dominant.\n\nYes, really.\n\nTexas was averaging 41.8 points and 484 yards. The Sooners held Texas to 310 yards \u2013 including an even 100 rushing \u2013 and sacked Sam Ehlinger nine times. It was more than enough to overcome an uneven offensive performance.\n\nOklahoma piled up yards but made several critical mistakes, too, preventing a rout from developing. Credit the Sooners, though, for responding each time Texas drew close. It\u2019s just possible Oklahoma is, in the words of those College Football Playoff selection committee chairmen, something like a \u201ccomplete\u201d team.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Oklahoma\u2019s victory against Texas:\n\n- Remember how we wondered what Oklahoma could be with an average defense? Well, what about with a good defense? During a soft early schedule, the Sooners had shown signs of defensive improvement. But Texas presented a significant upgrade.\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling Texas\u2019 production against another highly ranked opponent. A month earlier, the \u2018Horns lost to LSU \u2013 but put up 38 points and piled up 530 yards.\n\nNot against Oklahoma\u2019s defense, which dominated most of the way.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS:Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nBIG UPSET:South Carolina pulls stunner at No. 3 Georgia in two overtimes\n\nNEAR-COLLAPSE:No. 16 Michigan blows big lead before holding off Illinois\n\nUntil Roschon Johnson broke free up the middle for 57 yards midway through the third quarter (then followed with a 4-yard touchdown run to tie it at 10), Texas had 21 rushing yards on 22 carries. Even accounting for five sacks at that point, there was no room to run.\n\n- Jalen Hurts grabs the headlines, and he was good but not great Saturday. Meanwhile, Oklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb is the Sooners\u2019 best offensive player. The junior receiver was virtually unstoppable. After his catch-and-run for a 27-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, he had 10 catches, 171 yards and three scores.\n\nOn two of the TD catches, his skills after the catch were evident. He made three Texas defenders miss on a 51-yard TD catch off the flea-flicker. On the third score, he caught the ball crossing the middle, then tightroped the sidelines into the end zone.\n\n- After a pregame skirmish \u2013 it really wasn\u2019t quite that, more like a heated conversation \u2013 referee Mike Defee issued every player on both teams an unsportsmanlike conduct foul \u2013 putting every player on the knife\u2019s edge a half-hour before the game even started, since a second unsportsmanlike foul results in ejection.\n\nAt the coin toss, Defee told the team captains that \u201cunfortunately\u201d the unsportsmanlike fouls had been issued, and said:\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest rivalry in college football. I expect the game to be hard-fought and well-played. We\u2019re going to play this game with sportsmanship \u2013 is that clear?\u201d\n\nDuring that pregame melee, several Oklahoma players were seen flashing the \u201chorns down\u201d symbol, which has generated controversy in the Big 12 over whether Texas opponents would be flagged for doing it.", "description": "No. 5 Oklahoma used an aggressive defense and the big play by receiver of CeeDee Lamb to knock off No. 11 Texas  in the Cotton Bowl.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/12/USAT/d28c39ce-75e3-4518-9bbd-34f39263b2cb-USATSI_13501800.jpg?crop=3247,1826,x1,y414&width=2465&height=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
