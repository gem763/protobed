(AP) - For a team filled with young players at key spots, Arizona State has a knack at performing at its best in the toughest situations.\n\nEno Benjamin scored his third touchdown of the game on a 3-yard run with 4:41 remaining, and Arizona State beat No. 15 California 24-17 on Friday night for its second road win of the season against a ranked team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just growing,\u201d freshman quarterback Jayden Daniels said. \u201cWe like playing on the road, we like playing the tough teams. We like being the underdog team. People doubt us. \u2026 If you don\u2019t believe in us, we believe in ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Devils (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) bounced back from a 34-31 loss to Colorado in the conference opener last week thanks to a strong performance by Benjamin and the defense.\n\nBenjamin had 29 carries for 100 yards, also scoring on an 11-yard run in the first quarter and a 4-yarder in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be tough sledding but we kept trying to run it,\u201d coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give up on it and eventually we punched it in.\u201d\n\nDaniels added 174 yards passing and 84 more on the ground on an injured ankle as Arizona State picked up another road win against a ranked team after topping Michigan State 10-7 two weeks ago.\n\nThe Golden Bears (4-1, 1-1) lost their perfect record and quarterback Chase Garbers to a right shoulder injury, spoiling their highest ranking in a decade. The loss also left the Pac-12 with no undefeated teams before the end of September.\n\n\u201cThey outplayed us in every facet of the game,\u201d linebacker Evan Weaver said. \u201cCan\u2019t play very well and can\u2019t win games when you\u2019re not even making the simple plays, and we didn\u2019t today. That was it.\u201d\n\nGarbers threw a 16-yard TD pass to Trevon Clark in the first quarter before leaving with the shoulder injury late in the second quarter when he fell on his arm on a scramble. Garbers was in a splint for the second half and there was no word after the game on the extent of the injury.\n\nDevon Modster replaced him and struggled to move the ball through the air. Cal scored a TD in the third quarter on a 12-play drive that stayed on the ground, capped by a 1-yard run by Christopher Brown Jr.\n\nThe Bears then took a 17-14 lead when Joseph Ogunbanjo recovered a fumble by Daniels at the Arizona State 30 and Cal gained no yards before getting a 47-yard field goal from Greg Thomas.\n\nBut the Sun Devils answered with a 15-play, 75-yard drive capped by Benjamin\u2019s third TD and then forced a turnover on downs when Modster threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-3 from the Cal 29.\n\nCristian Zendejas kicked a 43-yard field goal to make it 24-17 and Cal was unable to get a first down.\n\n\u201cHonest I think I played terrible,\u201d Modster said. \u201cI could have played a lot better, just missing a lot of receivers.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArizona State: The Sun Devils won despite squandering several scoring opportunities in the first half. Zendejas missed a 37-yard field goal after an effective drive and then a 50-yarder after a deflected punt gave Arizona State the ball at the Cal 37. Then late in the half, Curtis Hodges dropped a pass when he was left alone in the middle of the field on a third-and-3 from the Cal 43, leading to a punt.\n\nCalifornia: The Bears struggled to generate anything in the passing game after Garbers got hurt, which doesn\u2019t bode well for the future. Modster finished 5 for 14 for 23 yards and threw an interception in the end zone to deny Cal a chance at a field goal at the end of the first half. Garbers was coming off his best game at Cal, throwing for 357 yards and four TDs in a win last week at Mississippi.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cIf guys aren\u2019t ready to work then I don\u2019t want them to be here. If they don\u2019t want to win the next game and win as many as we can they better not walk through this door on Monday. If people show up on Monday feeling down for themselves, feeling like they deserved to win this game . no one deserves to win anything. We didn\u2019t deserve to win this game because we didn\u2019t play well. They played better than us, they beat us.\u201d - Weaver.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona State: Host Washington State Oct. 12.\n\nCalifornia: Visit No. 13 Oregon next Saturday\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For a team filled with young players at key spots, Arizona State has a knack at performing at its best in the toughest situations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/arizona_state_california_football_90460_c0-388-6427-4135_s1770x1032.jpg?4fb23d647afef779a43770a896bfb411de5fc34f", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
