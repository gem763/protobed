This guy [Poite] doesn\u2019t think about the high-tackle framework and we get penalised.\n\n\u201cAs a former player, I\u2019m embarrassed about that,\u201d Cheika added. \u201cI don\u2019t know every directive, there\u2019s a fair few of them that come out.\n\n\u201cI think Poite may have said he [Kerevi] lifted his arm into the chest. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s legal or not. To be honest I don\u2019t know the rules anymore, I honestly don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCheika went a step further and hit out at the \u201cadministrators\u201d within the game that are causing referees to be \u201covercautious\u201d in all of their decision-making, and questioned how England centre Pier Francis was cleared of making a high-tackle when his own man was suspended for the rest of the pool stage.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand any more. They all seem spooked,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone seems worried about stuff so much, I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re worried. The players aren\u2019t worried. But then it\u2019s affecting everything else on the field as well like decisions on all types of crazy stuff.\n\n\u201cThen I heard that the English guy [Francis] got off at his suspension hearing, and I go \u2018wow\u2019.\n\n\u201cMaybe administrators are spooking the referees. Referees are worried about making the wrong decision. They\u2019re becoming ultra-cautious about everything but it\u2019s not inviting to the fans. Why should we be having booing out there at a game like that with those types of crowd. There shouldn\u2019t be people booing. They\u2019re not booing the players either. That shouldn\u2019t be happening.\n\n\u201cMaybe the lights going out at the end was a bit of a symbol.\u201d\n\nMichael Cheika claimed he was 'embarrassed' for rugby by the decision to punish Samu Kerevi (Getty)\n\nWallabies captain Michael Hooper engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with Poite about the decision, arguing that Kerevi only hit Patchell because his tackling technique was so poor \u2013which he later got a telling off for \u2013 but he said afterwards that not only are players unsure of how to tackle as Hodge admitted last week in his hearing, but that they are now questioning how to carry the ball into contact.\n\nHooper added: \u201cI can\u2019t remember word for word my discussion with him but I just don\u2019t know how to carry into another player, as a player. I\u2019m trying to make a dominant carry and he\u2019s used poor tackling technique and fallen back. I just don\u2019t know what Samu could\u2019ve done there.\u201d\n\nHooper faced his own TMO review when he hit starting fly-half Dan Biggar with a late tackle that saw Welsh fans baying for harsh punishment, with it remaining questionable if Hooper had made an attempt to wrap his arm at the point of contact. Poite elected to give a penalty-only to Wales, and Hooper admitted upon reflection it was probably fair.\n\nSamu Kerevi was punished by referee Romain Poite for leading with the arm (AFP/Getty)\n\n\u201cI knew I hit him low, I knew I didn\u2019t hit him in the head,\u201d Hooper added. \u201cIt was tough to pull out, that\u2019s the thing with slo-mo, it can make it look like anything, but I think that was probably fair in the end. I\u2019d have been surprised if had went any further, jeez. I\u2019d hope not, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland took a different approach to his antipodean rival though and refused to criticised the referees who already have enough on their plate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of criticism of the referees and I don\u2019t want to get involved in being a part of that. They\u2019ve got a tough job out there with thing they\u2019ve got to follow,\u201d the Wales head coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the judiciary take care of those things. That\u2019s how the decisions are made and we\u2019ve just got to abide by them.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWales see off Australia fightback to close in on World Cup last eight", "description": "Australia boss Michael Cheika said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by referee Romain Poite\u2019s decision to penalise Samu Kerevi during their thrilling 29-25 defeat against Wales, and claimed that he no longer understands the rules of rugby union.Kerevi found himself penalised following a TMO review when he ran into", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Z9dqz0eySQcQ3yYMTIOaAQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03MDI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y8gUNpq8jSCpAZBY2oEAeg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/79b7a1b066e8c6838b90308ce507e71c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
