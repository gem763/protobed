Throughout the fight, it sustained nearly 11,000 casualties,\" he said.\n\nBy comparison, he noted, only six US troops and two American civilians were killed in that campaign.\n\nTRUMP: US HELPED KURDS ENOUGH\n\nMr Trump has said he wants to end the US involvement in Syria and also explained that the US cannot do anything about a centuries-old hate between the Turks and Kurds.\n\nHe suggested that the United States has aided the Kurds enough.\n\n\"They are fighting for their land,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"They didn't help us with the Second World War. They didn't help us with Normandy, as an example.... We have spent tremendous amounts of money on helping the Kurds in terms of ammunition, in terms of weapons, in terms of money.\"\n\n\"With all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\" he added.\n\n'UPCOMING DISASTER'\n\nMark Hertling, the former commanding general of the US Army's European operations, said Mr Trump's decision \"presages an upcoming disaster for the US.\"\n\n\"Kurds of the SDF - our former reliable partners in the fight against ISIS - are being attacked by a Nato ally, Turkey. The repercussions for the US and Nato will be long-lasting and detrimental to security for Europe and the world,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nThe SDF took the lead in the major campaigns to dislodge Islamic State fighters from key cities in brutal sieges that they led.\n\nPentagon officials said they were better trained and focused to do the job compared to Turkish and Iraqi troops and other possible proxies in the war.\n\n\"When the Iraq army collapsed, the Kurds were the ones who took the full brunt of ISIS' attack on civilization, not us, not the Turks,\" said Ruben Gallego, an Iraq war veteran and Democratic congressman.\n\nPARALLELS IN US PAST\n\nSome are drawing a parallel to previous episodes in US wars abroad when an ally was left to fend for itself, including the governments of Laos and South Vietnam in the 1970s.\n\nSome are worried as well that after fighting the Taleban in Afghanistan for 18 years, US negotiations with the Islamist insurgents could lead to a deal that leaves the government in Kabul vulnerable to them.\n\nRepublican Senator Martha McSally, a former Air Force pilot who deployed to the Middle East six times, said that Mr Trump's decision to give way to Turkey \"is just wrong.\"\n\n\"The SDF, our Kurd allies, were the ones who paid a heavy price to fight that fight,\" she told Fox Radio.\n\n\"They're the ones that defeated the caliphate.\"\n\nNot all in the US military community were opposed to Mr Trump's move. Many support his desire to exit conflicts in the region after nearly two decades.\n\nDan Caldwell, a senior advisor at Concerned Veterans For America, said Mr Trump was putting US interests first.\n\n\"It is not in our national interest to be in the middle of a long-running conflict between Turkey and Syrian Kurds that predates the rise of ISIS and the Syrian Civil War,\" he told AFP.\n\nBut Mr Gallego stressed that Washington cannot assume other allies will trust the United States in the future.\n\n\"Outside of Israel, the strongest ally, and most consistent ally that we have had in the Middle East have been the Kurdish people... and we have just lost that,\" said Mr Gallego.\n\n\"Abandoning the Kurds is another stark reminder that 'America First' means 'America Alone,'\" he tweeted.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] President Donald Trump has come under angry criticism from US military veterans for abandoning Kurdish battlefield allies after greenlighting Turkey's assault on the Kurds in northeastern Syria. .
