unlawful\u201d.\n\nThe order has been condemned by the Green Party and Labour, with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott describing it as \u201ccompletely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest\u201d.\n\nHuman rights groups including Amnesty International and Liberty have also criticised the Metropolitan Police over the \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and \u201cchilling\u201d tactic.\n\nDeputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said the ban had been imposed following \u201ccontinued breaches\u201d of a previous order, which restricted protesters to Trafalgar Square.\n\nUnder the new order, any gathering of two or more people linked to XR\u2019s Autumn Uprising is deemed unlawful.\n\nBarrister Jo Maugham said the move was a \u201chuge overreach\u201d of police powers, while human rights lawyer Adam Wagner called it \u201ddraconian and extremely heavy-handed\u201d.\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, distanced himself from the police order and said he had asked senior officers to \"find a way for those who want to protest the climate emergency we face to be able to do so legally\".\n\nProtesters have vowed to defy the ban, with a rally planned for Trafalgar Square planned for Wednesday and a group of breastfeeding mothers and babies also demonstrating outside the offices of Google and YouTube.\n\nJulian Thompson, from XR, said: \u201cWe have been on the streets to demand that the government produces a plan to deal with the climate and ecological emergency.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s silence is deafening, with no mention of it in the Queen\u2019s Speech, which is their programme for government for the year.\n\n\u201cAt a time when it\u2019s more important than ever to peacefully assemble and protest on these emergencies, we are now at risk of being silenced by the authorities.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous precedent. We need more democracy, not less.\u201d\n\nA government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is already taking world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050.\n\n\u201cWhile we share people\u2019s concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people\u2019s day-to-day lives.\u201d", "description": "Greta Thunberg has called on Extinction Rebellion demonstrators to defy a police order banning them from protesting across London.
