The next week, seven hazing allegations were submitted against seven different fraternities within three days.\n\nAs a result, every member of the university's Interfraternity Council was suspended, the ACACIA and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternities were issued cease-and-desist letters, and the rest of the fraternities are waiting for the next five accused of hazing to be named. The next round of letters is expected to be sent within days.\n\nThe cease-and-desist letters did not specify what kind of hazing occurred, just noted that the \"health and safety\" of multiple students had been put at risk. Only fraternities were affected. Under the suspension, fraternities cannot hold meetings, host activities, or communicate as a group. No fraternities will take part in OU's Homecoming celebrations next week, but sororities will still participate as planned.\n\nIn a statement, OU's Dean of Students wrote, \"It is deeply troubling that seven of our Interfraternity Council (IFC) chapters have been or will be under investigation this semester for possible violations of the University's Student Code of Conduct.\"\n\nA Hazing Prevention Task Force had been formed the week before the suspensions, which were preceded by an alleged hazing death\n\nOhio University's Baker University Center, where the Sorority & Fraternity Life Office is located. Flicker/Hope Moore/C.C. by 3.0\n\nImmediately after the suspensions were announced, false reports that fraternity houses were being raided and that members were being arrested or forced to leave fraternity houses spread online. No direct action was taken against any student or fraternity besides the cease-and-desist letters, but no one was required to leave fraternity housing.\n\nA Hazing Prevention Task Force consisting of faculty and Greek Life students was formed by the Office of Student Affairs the week prior to the hazing allegation submissions. The group has met since but is waiting for the other five fraternity cease-and-desist letters to be sent before forming an action plan.\n\nA source who attended the Task Force meeting told Insider that the Sorority & Fraternity Life Office conveyed to Greek Life Council members that fraternities who were not named in the hazing complaints would be given an opportunity to come off suspension via steps that could resemble an exit interview, although those steps have not been made clear to Greek Life Council members yet. Members of Greek Life were also given a directive by OU faculty not to speak to members of the press.\n\nRead more: A fraternity is being investigated after video surfaced of members forcing a dog to do a keg stand\n\nIn April, the Sigma Pi fraternity was expelled from campus after it was found to have violated multiple OU policies concerning hazing and alcohol use. An 18-year-old student and alleged Sigma Pi pledge, Collin Wiant, died at an off-campus residence that served as an unofficial annex for the fraternity.\n\nWiant's family has alleged that he was the victim of hazing from Sigma Pi members. The national and local Sigma Pi chapter denied culpability, stating that Wiant was no longer considered a pledge at the time of his death. He died from asphyxiation due to nitrous-oxide consumption, known colloquially as \"whippets,\" The Athens News reported.\n\nThe day after Wiant's death, OU sent Sigma Pi a cease-and-desist. After a Student Code of Conduct investigation, the fraternity was found to have violated 10 statutes, including hazing through endangerment, brutality, coerced consumption, and coerced activity.\n\nOU has never suspended all fraternities at once, but Ohio State University suspended all 37 of its on-campus fraternities in 2017 after multiple hazing allegations. Fraternities that were not named at OSU were given steps to come off suspension, in a similar manner to what is expected to happen at OU.\n\nNeither Ohio University nor the Sorority & Fraternity Life Office at OU immediately responded to Insider's request for comment.", "description": "After OU sororities and fraternities held National Hazing Prevention Week events, 7 allegations against separate fraternities were brought forward.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9a5f5f695b581689624a34?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
