That probe brought an intense spotlight on the foreign dealings of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was a top adviser to Ukraine\u2019s then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, and played a key role in retaining Craig to write a report about the trial of Yanukovych\u2019s chief rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMueller\u2019s scrutiny of Manafort led prosecutors to dig into Craig\u2019s 2012 work and his responses to a Justice Department inquiry about whether he and his law firm at the time, Skadden Arps, needed to register as foreign agents for Ukraine in connection with the Tymoshenko project.\n\nIn April, a grand jury indicted Craig on two felony charges for allegedly misleading the department\u2019s Foreign Agent Registration Act unit about his Ukraine-related dealings. A judge dismissed one of those counts earlier this month, but ordered Craig to stand trial on a single charge of scheming to conceal material facts from federal officials.\n\nWithin minutes of being sworn in Wednesday, Craig, 74, denied the core allegation in the case: that he lied to and misled the head of the FARA unit, Heather Hunt.\n\n\u201cI did not lie to Ms. Hunt or the members of the FARA Unit,\u201d Craig said, under questioning from defense attorney William Taylor. \u201cI did not withhold or conceal any information from the FARA Unit.\u201d\n\nCraig, wearing a gray suit and blue tie, looked directly at the jury as he delivered the denials that kicked off his testimony. Jurors looked on intently, with one man leaning forward in his chair to get a good look at the defendant. Craig seemed a bit tense, but laughed on a couple of occasions, including when asked to spell his name, which has been ubiquitous at the trial.\n\nWhile Craig was adamant that he had not deceived Justice Department officials, later in his testimony he conceded that he relayed inaccurate information to Skadden colleagues regarding his dealings with journalists about the report.\n\nIn response to a September 2013 letter from Hunt stating that Skadden needed to register, Craig sent an email to the firm\u2019s general counsel, Larry Spiegel. The message, which opened with the phrase \u201cjust for the record,\u201d said three media outlets reached out to Skadden to get the report because they couldn\u2019t get it from the Ukrainian government. Craig\u2019s email also said he had not contacted the media.\n\nIn response to questions from Taylor, Craig said both answers were mistaken.\n\n\u201cIt was not fully accurate with respect to The New York Times, because we were contacting them and asking if they were interested,\u201d Craig said.\n\n\u201cDo you know why you got it wrong?\u201d Taylor asked.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d I get it wrong? I just muddled it up. I had not done a review of those emails,\u201d Craig said, referring to his contacts with journalists the previous December.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nCraig also acknowledged \u201cthe same kind of inaccuracies\u201d in a longer draft letter he prepared for the Justice Department. The firm decided not to send the letter and instead sought a meeting with the department.\n\nHowever, prosecutors say the email and the draft letter reflected the same false and misleading messages Craig had already sent to Hunt and would continue to deliver thereafter.\n\nMany of Taylor\u2019s questions seemed intended to take the sting out of Craig\u2019s anticipated cross-examination by the prosecution.\n\nThat inoculation effort was somewhat successful, but when prosecutor Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez took over, he seemed to put a significant dent in the defense\u2019s attempt to bolster Craig\u2019s upstanding reputation. The concerted defense case on that point featured four character witnesses on Tuesday who testified that, for decades, Craig\u2019s honesty and integrity have been impeccable.\n\nCampoamor quickly drew jurors\u2019 attention to a letter, contract and invoice signed by Craig in August 2012 that appeared to add $1.25 million to the token $12,000 that Ukraine\u2019s government originally agreed to pay for the Skadden work.\n\nThe prosecutor contended that not only did Craig include a series of falsehoods in the contracting documents, but that he did so to help Ukraine\u2019s government deal with swirling media questions about the funding for the Skadden report, which was secretly underwritten with $4.1 million from a Ukrainian steel magnate, Viktor Pinchuk.\n\n\u201cThis is about creating a new contract that will help Ukraine in its public relations nightmare that is the \u2018Skadden Stink,\u2019\u201d Campoamor said, referring to an unflattering editorial that had appeared on the subject in the English-language Kyiv Post.\n\nCraig maintained that the request for $1.25 million was to cover charges that were still piling up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about creating a new contract that will help the overrun in connection with expenses and fees,\u201d Craig said.\n\nBut Campoamor noted that Craig\u2019s letter referred to \u201cservices rendered\u201d and that Skadden still had money on hand from Pinchuk.\n\n\u201cSir, there were no outstanding payments due as of the date of this letter, correct?\u201d Campoamor asked.\n\n\u201cWe have not sent an invoice for outstanding \u2014 with a charge? No,\u201d Craig replied, adding later, \u201cAt that moment, there were not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet your letter on Skadden\u2019s letterhead says that there were. \u2026 That\u2019s a lie,\u201d Campoamor declared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Craig acknowledged.\n\nDuring opening statements two weeks ago, Taylor seemed to concede that Craig\u2019s actions surrounding the invoice \u2014 which was being sought by Manafort \u2014 were problematic.\n\n\u201cMr. Craig will be the first to tell you \u2026 he could be rightly criticized for signing it,\u201d Taylor said then, calling the funding request \u201cexaggerated.\u201d\n\nCraig spent about three hours being questioned by the defense before a nearly two-hour grilling by Campoamor. The defendant\u2019s cross-examination is expected to continue on Thursday morning, with closing statements not likely until after Labor Day.\n\nNear the outset of the prosecution\u2019s questioning on Tuesday, Campoamor pressed Craig about an October 2017 interview he did with lawyers and FBI agents from Mueller\u2019s team. Citing a so-called FBI 302 report on the interview, the prosecutor said Craig conceded there that he reached out to New York Times reporter David Sanger \u201cpursuant\u201d to a media plan prepared by Ukraine\u2019s public relations advisers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you with you, Mr. Campoamor, but that\u2019s not what the 302 says,\u201d Craig said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to read it, so everybody can see what it says,\u201d the prosecutor offered. However, FBI interview reports are typically not admissible and the judge would not permit it. The report, filed publicly with the court in June, says Craig admitted to contacting Sanger as indicated in the media plan, but does not say that was the reason he did it.\n\nIt also emerged during Craig\u2019s testimony that he had met a Russian-Ukrainian aide to Manafort suspected of ties to Russian intelligence, Konstantin Kilimnik, well before encountering Kilimnik in connection with the Tymoshenko project.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d met him a year or two before,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWe were pursuing another engagement in Ukraine, and Mr. Kilimnik was involved in trying to set up meetings with some government officials.\u201d He did not elaborate, although jurors were shown an email that Craig sent to Manafort calling Kilimnik \u201cwonderful.\u201d\n\nDuring the defense questioning earlier Wednesday, Taylor queried Craig on another issue that has been central to the trial: whether Craig and Skadden should have registered as foreign agents for Ukraine as a result of their work related to the report. Prosecutors say such a registration was required, but Craig is not directly charged in the case with failing to register.\n\nCraig insisted on Wednesday that his view was and is that he did not need to register because his contacts with the media were done to advance his and his law firm\u2019s interests, not Ukraine\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI did not think it crossed the line,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI did not think any of those contacts made me a press agent or agent for Ukraine. \u2026 I was defending the integrity of our report.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have shown jurors an email Craig sent to Sanger saying that Ukraine wanted him to get a first look at the report. Despite that, Craig claimed that in delivering the report to Sanger, he was not acting on behalf of the former Soviet republic.\n\n\u201cI made a point of saying \u2026 that Ukraine made that determination, not me,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI did not want David to think that I was looking for a favor here.\u201d\n\nCraig said he offered to drop the report off at The Times\u2019 Washington bureau, but Sanger suggested that Craig bring it to Sanger\u2019s home, which is near Craig\u2019s in Northwest Washington.\n\nTaylor asked Craig about testimony from a British public relations representative for Ukraine, Jonathan Hawker, that handing the report over to Sanger was intended to kick off a media and political outreach campaign aimed at burnishing the image of the Ukrainian government and undercutting criticism from Tymoshenko\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cIt may have been, but that was not the reason I was calling Mr. Sanger,\u201d Craig said. He did say he reached out to Sanger to head off Hawker doing the same, because he did not trust the FTI Consulting staffer to accurately characterize the report.\n\nProsecutors contend that Craig intentionally misled the Justice Department in a June 2013 letter when he mentioned contacts with the media one and two days after he delivered the report to Sanger. Drafts of the letter obtained from Skadden show that the dates at one point were changed to cover the date of actual delivery, Dec. 11, 2012, then changed back.\n\nThe prosecution says Craig was trying to conceal his delivery of the report to Sanger, but Craig said the dates were an error \u2014 one that he regrets.\n\n\u201cI think I used those dates because they referred to the dates of the articles,\u201d the longtime D.C. lawyer said. \u201cIt should have included the 11th. \u2026 Going back and reviewing it, I wish we\u2019d put December 11 in there rather than December 12.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have argued that Craig did not want to register because it could affect his career or those of others on his team. Under defense questioning, he acknowledged that concern, but also said that registering as an agent for Ukraine would have undercut perceptions that the Tymoshenko report was independent.\n\n\u201cI had been White House counsel. \u2026 If people had served as foreign agents, they had to wait two years before they could be considered for appointments in the administration. It was an attempt to reduce the perception that people were going in and out of government for their own benefit and their own profit,\u201d Craig explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had high positions in government and was less concerned about myself, although that policy would\u2019ve affected, but there were other people on my teams that would have been adversely affected if they had to register as foreign agents,\u201d the veteran Washington attorney said.\n\nCraig noted that two attorneys who worked on the report, Clifford Sloan and Allon Kedem, did later join the government.\n\nBefore detailing the career concerns, Craig said he worried that registering as foreign agents would also be a credibility problem for the report.\n\n\u201cIf we also registered as an agent for Ukraine at the same time we were writing this report, that was saying we could not do this independently,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a Catch-22. If you register, that means you\u2019re a foreign agent under the direction of a foreign sovereign.\u201d\n\nCraig seemed a bit stiff at the outset of defense questioning, but looked more comfortable as the process wore on. While lawyers argued privately at the bench, he left the witness stand and leaned against the courtroom wall not far from the jury.\n\nThe former White House official grew heated and emphatic at only one point: when Taylor asked him about a claim that the Skadden report found Tymoshenko produced no evidence to support her allegations that she was being persecuted. That assertion appeared in a \u201cmessaging\u201d document sent to him from Hawker, the British P.R. specialist, who testified earlier in the trial.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a flat-out lie about our report,\u201d Craig shouted. \u201cWe never said that. I was very angry.\u201d\n\nCraig then launched into an attack on Hawker. \u201cIf I suspected Jonathan Hawker would lie about this\u2026\u201d Craig said, stopping after the judge cut him off.\n\n\u201cI understand you have passionate feelings about all of this,\u201d the judge said, before telling Craig to wait for a question from Taylor rather than giving freeform statements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Honor,\u201d Craig said.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s probe targeted a variety of individuals in President Donald Trump\u2019s orbit, Craig is the only Democratic political appointee to face charges in a case stemming from the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nCraig is accused of lying to or misleading investigators about a variety of facts related to the Ukraine project, but the central focus has been on whether he sought to obscure his role in orchestrating initial press coverage of his report and, in particular, an initial New York Times story detailing the findings of the Skadden team.\n\nProsecutors say Craig\u2019s evasions were driven in part by his reluctance to expose the true cost of the Ukrainian report and the source of the money for that work, Pinchuk.\n\nHowever, emails shown at the trial indicate Craig favored disclosing Pinchuk\u2019s identity early in the project, even suggesting to Manafort that he \u201cout\u201d the wealthy Ukrainian with or without his consent.\n\nCraig\u2019s turn on the witness stand came after about two weeks of testimony, much of it from Craig\u2019s former colleagues at Skadden Arps and others who worked on a public relations plan for the rollout of the firm\u2019s report.\n\nManafort, who is serving a seven-and-a-half-year federal prison sentence for tax and bank fraud, as well as conspiring to evade the foreign-agent-registration law in connection with Craig\u2019s Ukraine project, did not testify at Craig\u2019s trial.\n\nHowever, Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man, Rick Gates, did testify, describing a few interactions with Craig about the report, including a rollout-related meeting that Manafort, Gates, Craig and others attended at the Harvard Club in New York in September 2012. Gates is cooperating with prosecutors as he awaits sentencing on conspiracy and false-statement charges brought by Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nCraig faces a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison if convicted, but most defendants are sentenced under federal guidelines that typically call for more lenient punishment, particularly for offenders with no prior criminal record.\n\nProbation is a possible sentence if the jury of nine men and three women convicts Craig, although other defendants who pleaded guilty to a similar charge in Mueller-related cases got short prison terms.\n\n", "description": "Within minutes of being sworn in Wednesday, Craig denied the core allegation in the case: that he lied to and misled the head of Justice\u2019s Foreign Agent Registration Act unit.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c6/4c/a3bd313e4ffda6ffef5e2e5550bd/190828-greg-craig-ap-773.jpg"}
