REUTERS/Toby Melville/Pool/File Photo\n\nPrincess Diana, who became one of the most photographed women on the planet after she married into the British royal family, died in a car crash in 1997 after being followed through the streets of Paris by photographers.\n\nEarlier this month Harry\u2019s wife, Meghan Markle, began legal action against a newspaper in response to what the couple described as \u201cbullying\u201d by some sections of the British media. At the time, Harry said the treatment of Markle was reminiscent of their approach to his mother.\n\n\u201cEverything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw every single day and that is not being me being paranoid. That is just me not wanting a repeat of the past,\u201d Harry told ITV in an interview that was filmed during a tour of Africa earlier this month and aired on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPart of this job ... means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need to do is focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are and standing up for what we believe in. I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\u201d\n\nHarry is also suing the publishers of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper and the Daily Mirror over allegations of phone-hacking.\n\nDescribing what happened to his mother as \u201ca wound that festers,\u201d Harry said: \u201cEvery single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back.\u201d\n\nAsked about newspaper reports of a rift with his older brother, William, Harry said, \u201cinevitably stuff happens\u201d as part of the role and the pressure the family is under.\n\n\u201cWe will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAs brothers you have good days you have bad days.\u201d\n\nMarkle\u2019s proceedings against the Mail on Sunday newspaper are over the publication of a private letter that her lawyers said was \u201cunlawful\u201d and part of a \u201ccampaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her.\u201d\n\nAsked during an interview for the same ITV documentary about how she had found the last year, the American former actress said it had been hard, and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t get it\u201d when British friends had warned her about tabloid newspapers when she had first met Harry.\n\n\u201cI never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that is the part that is really hard to reconcile,\u201d Markle said.\n\n\u201cWhen people are saying things that are just untrue and they have been told they are untrue, but they are allowed to still say them, I don\u2019t know anybody in the world that would feel like that is OK, and that is different from just scrutiny.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry has said the memory of his mother Diana's death more than two decades ago was still incredibly raw and he would not be bullied into \"playing the game\" with the media that he believes killed her.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443150220&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0RV", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
