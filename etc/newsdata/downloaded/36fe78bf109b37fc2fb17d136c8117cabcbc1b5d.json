It will be held on Nov 10.\n\nBut the rest of the day's ceremonies will go ahead, starting with rituals conducted behind closed doors in which Naruhito will \"report\" the proclamation to his ancestors in the ancient royal dynasty.\n\nHours later, he and his wife Empress Masako will appear at the main event in the Imperial Palace's most prestigious hall, the Pine Room.\n\nNaruhito, in a ceremonial outfit dominated by a voluminous draped outer robe in brown gold -- a color worn only by the emperor -- will declare his enthronement from the Takamikura throne.\n\nEmpress Masako, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, will wear an elaborate outfit known as junihitoe or many-layered robe, and be alongside the emperor on a slightly smaller throne.\n\nHer silk robes will be so heavy it will be difficult for her to move, and attendants will trail her adjusting her outfit.\n\nThe ceremony will be conducted in the presence of an ancient sword and jewel -- part of the imperial regalia said to have been handed down by a goddess and considered crucial evidence of an emperor's legitimacy.\n\nSome 2,500 guests, including foreign dignitaries and royalty from more than 190 countries will rise to drum beats before the proclamation.\n\nAfter it is complete, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will exclaim \"banzai\" (\"long live the Emperor\") three times, completing the process.\n\nWhile the parade has been put off, a banquet for foreign dignitaries and local government representatives will go ahead, along with an afternoon tea party at the imperial residence the following day.\n\nAbe will also host a banquet for 900 foreign leaders and delegates at a Tokyo hotel.\n\nThe foreign visitors will range from royalty including Britain's Prince Charles, to government officials including South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.\n\nOxford-educated Naruhito faces a delicate balancing act as emperor, seeking to continue his father's legacy of bringing the monarchy closer to the people, while upholding the centuries-old traditions of the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\nHe has spoken up to defend his wife, who struggled with the transition to cloistered royal life after leaving behind a promising diplomatic career to marry Naruhito.\n\nThe couple have one child, a 17-year-old daughter called Aiko, who cannot inherit the throne because she is female.\n\nWith Naruhito's ascension, his brother Akishino became crown prince. Akishino's son -- 13-year-old Hisahito -- is currently the only other remaining successor.\n\nThe dwindling ranks of male heirs in the royal family has rekindled debate about allowing female royals to ascend the throne, but so far there have been no formal moves to accommodate the possibility.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japan's new Emperor Naruhito will formally proclaim his ascension to the throne on Tuesday in a ritual-bound ceremony, but the after-effects of deadly typhoon will cast a shadow over proceedings.
