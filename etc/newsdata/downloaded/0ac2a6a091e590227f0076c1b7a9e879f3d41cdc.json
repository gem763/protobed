Trump appeared unfazed and continued waving. (Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\n\"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have taken to social media to respond to backlash to their disgust expressed on Monday's show with the way President Donald Trump was treated at Game 5 of the World Series Sunday night.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief and the first lady watched D.C.'s home team take on the Houston Astros at Nationals Park. In the fourth inning, some attendees began shouting \"lock him up,\" a reference to the motto that Trump supporters directed at Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump was also booed.\n\nBrzezinski shared a pair of photos with her co-host and husband to Instagram.\n\n\"It\u2019s one of those days when I feel the need to say how proud I am to be sharing this show (and life)with this man!!\" she wrote in the caption. \"Joe and I both feel strongly that our democracy is being challenged and even squandered every day by weak Republicans who cannot put country over party. It\u2019s why Joe left the party.\n\n\"He is still a conservative. He is still a constitutionalist and he is still a man who deeply loves this country,\" she continued. \"He fears the rise of illiberalism, wherever it comes from. And right now, that is Donald Trump. Joe and I agree with @michelleobama when they go low, we must strive to go high. Remember @repcummings Cumming\u2019s famous words, 'we are better than this'! #Morningjoe\"\n\nOn Twitter, she said, \"I understand the chanting at the game - But, I worry it is dangerous when it happens - On both sides. It\u2019s been a consistent concern on my part. Thank (you) for (your) opinions!!\"\n\nScarborough called out what he viewed as hypocrisy.\n\n\"So let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight: When crowds chant 'Lock her up' toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree),\" he tweeted. \"But when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred First Amendment rights. What hypocritical clowns.\"\n\n\"If you think that democracy is strengthened by calling for the arrest of political opponents, you\u2019re as ignorant and illiberal as Trump himself,\" he said in another tweet. \"Delete your account and read some civics. Stop embarrassing yourself.\"\n\n\"Republicans, look at the response to a very traditional view that in America, we do not call for the arrest of political opponents,\" he continued. \"And then understand that you reap what you sow.\"\n\nAddressing the chants on the show Monday, Scarborough called the behavior \"just un-American. It started with Donald Trump. In fact, he's made it a centerpiece of his campaign rallies.\"\n\n\"We find it sickening when it happens at his rallies,\" said Brzezinski.\n\nPresident Donald Trump greeted with boos at Game 5 of World Series, fans chant 'lock him up'\n\nOpinion: President Donald Trump's World Series visit may be his last \u2013 for good reason\n\n\"We are Americans and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant 'Lock him up' to this president or to any president.\" -- @JoeNBCpic.twitter.com/9IgMCETBdn \u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) October 28, 2019\n\n\"Of course, it's sickening,\" Scarborough concurred. \"We are Americans, and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant, 'Lock him up,' to this president or to any president.\"\n\n\"Let's hope, as we move forward, maybe this is one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use during chants \u2013 that you are going to actually imprison your political opponent,\" he added. \"So, let's leave that behind.\"\n\n\"Let's hope he gets it,\" Brzezinski said.\n\nThe segment inspired trending topics on Twitter Monday morning, including \"Mika,\" \"Morning Joe\" and \"Sorry Joe.\"\n\nSome on the social media site felt the game attendees' actions were more than acceptable.\n\n\"Get over yourself,\" wrote one user. \"The country can speak as they wish, it\u2019s the best thing about our country.\"\n\n\"Sorry Joe, the world wants to hear us saying that,\" posted another. \"And they are right. True Americans have stand up to what is happening and to what this man is doing to this country.\"\n\n\"This was democracy shining,\" a commenter tweeted.\n\nContributing: Scott Boeck\n\n'SNL': Alec Baldwin's Trump skit jabs zealous rallygoers \u2013 with a cameo by an ISIS escapee\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/28/trump-lock-him-up-chants-world-series-sickening-morning-joe/2484157001/", "description": "\"Morning Joe\" hosts\u00a0Joe Scarborough and\u00a0Mika Brzezinski expressed disgust after World Series attendees shouted \"Lock him up\" at President Trump.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
