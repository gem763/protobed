The UN says the summit is an attempt to motivate countries, companies, cities and civil society to achieve the objectives of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nYoung people to advise UK on hitting net zero emissions by 2050 Read more\n\nThe invitation sent to some summit guests from Bob Dudley, group chief executive of BP and chair of the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Schmitt, chair of the OGCI steering committee, described the 22 September meeting as an intimate gathering.\n\nDudley and Schmitt wrote in the invitation: \u201cThis will be an opportunity to speak personally with the CEOs and share your thoughts on OGCI\u2019s progress and commitments over the last year.\u201d\n\nThe men said the meeting would involve \u201cour most important stakeholders from across industry, academia, government and non-profits for this closed high level discussion\u201d.\n\nQuick guide Covering Climate Now: how more than 250 newsrooms are joining forces this week to spotlight the climate crisis Show Hide Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time: the climate emergency. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September \u2013 and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September \u2013 the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El Pa\u00eds, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations.

Mark Brownstein, senior vice-president of energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said: \u201cYou make progress by talking to people that you don\u2019t always agree with as well as people that you do agree with.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a global challenge and we cannot afford to marginalise anyone.\u201d\n\nBrownstein said he was using the access to the CEOs to push the oil and gas industry to rapidly cut methane emissions from the extraction and production of fossil fuel. He said: \u201cHuman-caused methane emissions are driving about 25% of the warming that our planet is experiencing now, and oil and gas production is responsible for one third of that as a consequence of their global operations.\n\n\u201cI am both pressurising them to address this issue and also engaging with them to develop the technologies and practices necessary to achieve the reduction.\u201d\n\nBrownstein said he hoped the industry would provide transparent data on their tactics to reduce emissions and their work so far at the forum.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a need for real field data made publicly available and it is laudable to aspire to significant reductions, but it is imperative that companies provide the real data \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen anything yet from them.\u201d\n\nThe National Resources Defense Council, the US-based environmental advocacy group, said it had been invited to the forum and was considering whether to attend.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe will be weighing the value of speaking directly to the people making the decisions against the undeserved positive glow that some companies may seek to reap from this event.\n\n\u201cSometimes there can be value in frank face-to-face communication directly with the people who run the companies most responsible for our climate pollution, telling them, without any filters, our concerns with their high-carbon investment decisions, their support for regulatory rollbacks, and their opposition to effective carbon policies.\u201d\n\nBut Extinction Rebellion, the sociopolitical movement against climate breakdown, condemned the OGCI gathering.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis is how lobbying and greenwash works: private meetings, on the sidelines, back door stuff, handpicked attendees.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to find industry-led, voluntary initiatives resulting in the changes needed because it is manifestly against the financial interests of oil companies to stop extracting the Earth\u2019s resources. These meetings do show that they are worried, and probably admit to themselves that the game\u2019s up \u2013 but there\u2019s still too much money to be made.\u201d\n\nSchmitt, chair of the OGCI executive committee, said: \u201cOur annual event during Climate Week NYC is part of OGCI member companies\u2019 joint efforts, with a broad range of stakeholders, to increase the speed and impact of our actions to support the Paris agreement. We see our work on reducing methane emissions, carbon intensity and development of a commercial carbon capture utilisation and storage industry as a necessity, not an option, in meeting the world\u2019s climate goals.\u201d", "description": "BP, Shell and Chevron representatives will be at event on sidelines of UN climate summit", "authors": ["Sandra Laville", "Jill Abramson", "Bernie Sanders", "Mark Jacobson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5739d58746507c10f60bb0811378780f86566e56/0_166_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c42838d935486ab3bd771d495201b6ff", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
