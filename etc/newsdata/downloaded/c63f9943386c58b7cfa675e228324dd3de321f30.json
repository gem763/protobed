Meanwhile, NBCUniversal also shuttered its Universal Games and Digital Platforms division on Thursday as a part of the overall restructuring, ending its two-year run in the mobile games market. The division released several mobile games based on company-owned franchises, including Minions, Jurassic World and How to Train Your Dragon.\n\n\"Given the realities of the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile games landscape, Universal Brand Development is shifting its investment and approach in games to opportunities that don\u2019t require mobile self-publishing,\" an NBCUniversal spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter. \"This will allow UBD to deepen their licensing and partnership opportunities across all gaming platforms.\"\n\nBerwick outlined the Lifestyle Group shakeup in a memo sent to staff on Thursday and obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"I\u2019m confident that this new structure, which creates multi-brand roles, will allow us to continue to grow the business and optimize our internal talent,\" she wrote. \"I realize that this is major change for us, but I believe this leadership team and new structure, along with the talented employees working across all these brands, will drive our continued success\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "NBCUniversal shuttered its gaming division while laying off 5 percent of the workforce at its lifestyle brand networks.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Beverly-Hills-Housewives-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
