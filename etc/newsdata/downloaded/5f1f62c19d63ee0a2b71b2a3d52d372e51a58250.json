According to Deadline, Jason Bateman is in talks to direct the movie, which he will \u201cdevelop\u201d a script for with Ryan Reynolds, who it was announced last year would be producing the project. It sounds like both men would also appear in the movie, but discussions are said to still be early. At the time Reynolds took up Clue, he had recently signed a multi-year producing deal with Fox, and his Deadpool writers, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, were assigned to the screenplay for the board game adaptation. Now all four men could be working on it together, with Bateman fresh off his upset Emmy win for direction. He beat out Game of Thrones for the trophy \u2014 to be more clear, he beat the three nominated Thrones episodes, including \u201cThe Long Night\u201d \u2014 which is a pretty big get for Bateman specifically and Ozark generally.", "description": "Jason Bateman is in talks to direct, and possibly star in, the new adaptation of the board game Clue, which is being produced by Ryan Reynolds, who might also star.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-bateman-emmy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
