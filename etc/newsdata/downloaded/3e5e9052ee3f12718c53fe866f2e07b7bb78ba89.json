But it\u2019s useful to put historical data in context.\n\nWhile having at least a bachelor\u2019s degree does reduce the likelihood of getting laid off, all college graduates are not treated the same by employers.\n\nYoung college graduates will likely be the first to receive pink slips in the next recession. That has been the case during the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, and during the 2001 recession which Americans endured for eight months.\n\nBrookings Institution economist Harry Holzer says newer college graduates are among the first to be targeted by employers in a recession, because they are the most marginal people in the workforce, having just entered it. \"Young people get hit the hardest during a recession and that will include young college grads. It will take them longer to find any job, and it will take longer for them to find the jobs they really like in terms of beginning a career,\" he says.\n\nYouth is a factor that tends to work against workers in a recession. People who have recently entered the labor market \u201care most vulnerable to economic shock, by comparison, to people who are more established in their careers,\u201d says Hamilton Project policy director Ryan Nunn. They \u201cmay have a more durable relationship with a particular employer and maybe can ride out the recession a little more easily.\u201d\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for workers aged 20 to 24 with a bachelor\u2019s degree rose from 5.4% in 2007 to 8.5% in 2009, according to the BLS. It was much lower for older college graduates with the same education during the financial crisis \u2013 it went from 2.2% in 2007 to 5.2% in 2009.\n\nAlthough the recession officially ended in June 2009, the unemployment rates for both groups were even higher in 2010. Unemployment for young college graduates was 9.2%, and 5.4% for older college graduates.\n\nGetty Images More\n\nPeople have cause to be a least a little concerned. A few signs have been bubbling up that suggest a less-than-rosy economic picture \u2013 both in the US and globally. U.S. manufacturer growth slowed to the lowest level in almost 10 years in August, according to results from IHS Markit data. And last week the Federal Reserve reported that manufacturing output fell 0.4% in July from a month earlier, and was 0.5% lower compared with a year ago.\n\nNot to mention a closely watched part of the yield curve inverted on Aug. 14. (The yield curve is a powerful predictor of an economic downturn, and an inversion has preceded each of the last seven recessions dating back to 1969.)\n\nThese factors have been fueling recession fears, and with it memories of the millions of layoffs that hit U.S. workers a decade ago during the Great Recession.\n\nWhenever a recession does hit, it\u2019s important to remember, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be like the last one in 2008. At its lowest point, in February 2010, U.S. employment had declined by 8.8 million jobs from its pre-recession peak, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Monthly job losses averaged 712,000 from October 2008 through March 2009 \u2013 the most severe six-month period of job losses since 1945.\n\nLingering impact of 2008 financial crisis\n\nThe 2008 recession wreaked havoc on the financial well-being of many workers by delaying the trajectory of their careers and costing them lost wages. Millennials who graduated into the recession faced \u201clarge, negative, and persistent effects on their incomes,\u201d according to a report by the Hamilton Project at Brookings Institution, \u201cThe Damage Done by Recessions and How to Respond.\u201d", "description": "How the recession will impact those who are most vulnerable to economic shock.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FlVa2JpVwCxnsy4Rtk9DhA--~B/aD01MDAwO3c9ODAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/10fd1d50-9914-11e9-bdff-5f2167228162", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
