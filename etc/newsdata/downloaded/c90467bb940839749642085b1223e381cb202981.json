Alphabet's Waymo and GM Cruise, backed by SoftBank Group's $100bn Vision Fund, already clocked more than 25,000 kilometres (15,534 miles) of hands-free rides last year, according to a 2018 report by a California government agency.\n\nRide-hailing firm Lyft Inc has also said it will invest heavily in self-driving cars, while German carmaker BMW and Chinese online gaming giant Tencent Holdings have teamed up to launch a computing centre in China.\n\nDrivers also seem primed for the revolution. Many drivers already factor whether a car has self-driving features into their buying decisions, the report by Adobe said, with more interest in connected cars than ever before, with support growing by over 35 percent in the last year.\n\nMillennials are the most accepting of electric, hybrid and connected vehicles. Many drivers want to enjoy more leisurely activities like enjoying their favourite podcast or catching up on their favourite TV show while their cars drive themselves.", "description": "A new survey shows acceptance of autonomous vehicles is growing in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/abf1285c0f0d410dab458a205f89a043_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
