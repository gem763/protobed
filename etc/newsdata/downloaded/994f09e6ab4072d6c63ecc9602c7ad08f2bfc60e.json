On June 8, her brother John Vargas, 29, arrived in town.\n\nCourt records state that Vargas was 'developmentally disabled' and easily persuaded.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nHe and Serbu bought a phone and a Verizon rechargeable card for it, which they used only for communicating with Sierra. Using the phone, Serbu arranged to pick Sierra up and pay him for assembling the bunk bed on July 7, 2016.\n\nTaking Vargas with her, she instead drove Sierra to the location, while confronting him about her daughter's accusation.\n\nNaples News reports the pair chased Sierra into some woods and it is believed the two men died while wrestling for 'one of Serbu's guns'.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nSierra was said to have received gunshot wounds from 'both guns', while Vargas was hit in the abdomen, killing him.\n\nThe Sun reports Sierra was chased down when he tried to escape and Sierra himself fired a gun six times after wrestling Vargas for it.\n\nSerbu was reportedly still at the scene when police arrived.\n\nOfficers allege she made a confession which showed no remorse, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. So I don\u2019t care, he raped my daughter \u2026 she told me everything that happened.\u201d", "description": "Connie Serbu allegedly murdered Xavier Sierra after accusing him of raping her child", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11096711.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GCP_CHP_010917Connie-Serbu-Xavier-Sierra-_726Connie-Serbu-Xavier-Sierra-JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
