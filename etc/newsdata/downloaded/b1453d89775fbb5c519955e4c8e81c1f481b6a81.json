Yet there are few options out there for asset-allocation ETFs\u2014ones that contain a mix of investments, like the familiar target-date or target-risk mutual funds in retirement accounts. And the asset-allocation options that are in the market now haven\u2019t drawn a lot of interest.\n\nWhy have asset-allocation funds been pretty much immune to the ETF fervor? The answer can be found in the nature of retirement accounts, where most of these asset-allocation funds are found.\n\nThe retirement advantage\n\nCollectively, traditional asset-allocation mutual funds\u2014which include target retirement-date funds, target-risk funds and balanced funds\u2014hold $1.3 trillion, according to Morningstar Direct. And those funds are a widespread option inside of retirement plans, including IRAs. They got a huge boost in 2006 with the Pension Protection Act, which mandated that 401(k) plans put participants in a qualified default investment alternative if they don\u2019t make an active choice. Often, that meant an asset-allocation vehicle.\n\nThe upshot is that when ETF companies tried to break into the asset-allocation world a few years ago, they found that the largest market was already dominated by mutual funds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the usual tax benefits of ETFs aren\u2019t as significant inside of retirement plans, because those accounts are tax-advantaged to begin with.\n\nSo, asset-allocation ETFs haven\u2019t found much of an audience. In fact, two of the earliest entrants into the ETF asset-allocation field, DWS and BlackRock , which offered suites of target-date products, closed those funds four and five years ago, respectively.\n\nThe persistent problem\n\nAccording to research firm CFRA, there are still only about 40 asset-allocation funds available as ETFs, primarily constructed as \u201cETFs of ETFs\u201d\u2014in other words, an ETF holding other ETFs. Asset-allocation ETFs manage just $7.5 billion in assets, with three iShares Core ETFs from BlackRock (Growth, Moderate, and Aggressive) each holding about $1 billion, and another (Conservative) at $535 million. Net expense ratios run from 0.2% to over 2%. ETFs have total assets of $4 trillion.\n\n\u201cETF issuers have rushed into a lot of areas, such as factor investing and thematics,\u201d says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research for CFRA in New York, \u201cbut allocation funds remain very small relative to the opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the retirement-plan problem, some experts and ETF executives argue that there is another reason for the lack of asset-allocation ETFs.\n\nThe Few, the Proud A sampling of asset-allocation ETFs ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (billions) FUND | TICKER NET EXPENSE RATIO 0.25% $1.30 iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF | AOR iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF | AOM 1.11 0.25 SPDR SSgA Global Allocation ETF | GAL 0.26 0.35 Principal Active Income ETF | YLD 0.49 0.25 ClearShares OCIO ETF | OCIO 0.67 0.11 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (billions) NET EXPENSE RATIO FUND | TICKER $1.30 0.25% iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF | AOR iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF | AOM 0.25 1.11 SPDR SSgA Global Allocation ETF | GAL 0.26 0.35 Principal Active Income ETF | YLD 0.49 0.25 ClearShares OCIO ETF | OCIO 0.67 0.11 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (billions) FUND | TICKER NET EXPENSE RATIO $1.30 0.25% iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF | AOR iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF | AOM 0.25 1.11 SPDR SSgA Global Allocation ETF | GAL 0.26 0.35 Principal Active Income ETF | YLD 0.49 0.25 ClearShares OCIO ETF | OCIO 0.67 0.11 Net expense ratio Assets under management (billions) FUND | TICKER iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF | AOR $1.30 0.25% iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF | AOM 0.25% $1.11 SPDR SSgA Global Allocation ETF | GAL $0.26 0.35% Principal Active Income ETF | YLD 0.49% $0.25 ClearShares OCIO ETF | OCIO 0.67% $0.11\n\nFund managers have been focused in recent years on selling ETF to, and through, financial advisers, says Rick Ferri of Ferri Investment Solutions. That means, he says, that many ETF companies don\u2019t want to introduce all-in-one products that compete with those advisers, who plan out portfolios for clients.\n\nSimilarly, he says, it may not be in the interest of financial advisers to push ETFs that do the asset allocation for investors. Mr. Ferri, who provides portfolio advice but doesn\u2019t manage client money, says advisers and asset managers can make investment solutions more complicated than they need to be to justify their fee. This includes frequent rebalancing. Balanced ETFs would eliminate this, which is why \u201cthose advisers are not fans.\u201d\n\n(Of course, the same is true of traditional asset-allocation mutual funds\u2014but they are buoyed by their massive advantage in retirement accounts and don\u2019t need strong support from financial advisers to thrive.)\n\nIn December 2014, Meb Faber, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management, was ready to \u201cdisrupt the traditional high-fee asset-allocation fund universe\u201d when his firm launched Cambria Global Asset Allocation ETF (GAA), the first of Cambria\u2019s three allocation ETFs. But breaking through has been a challenge.\n\n\u201cNo broker or adviser wants to put a client in just one fund,\u201d says Mr. Faber, who has put most of his publicly traded investments into his Cambria Trinity ETF (TRTY). Since its launch in September 2018, it has accumulated $35 million in assets.\n\nA guiding hand\n\nKostya Etus, portfolio manager, CLS Investments, a $9 billion investment manager in Omaha, disagrees that financial advisers shun broad ETFs out of self-interest. Rather, he says, financial advisers are able to assess investments for specific clients with specific needs, as opposed to the broadly generalized approach of an asset-allocation product. Advisers can also can choose the best ETFs, no matter who issues them\u2014which reduces bias. He attributes the advantage of conventional asset-allocation mutual funds largely to their entrenched position in retirement plans.\n\nDespite the obstacles, some of the largest ETF issuers are going ahead with the all-in-one ideas. Along with BlackRock, State Street Corp. \u2019s State Street Global Advisors and Invesco offer suites of allocation ETFs. Vanguard Group, which offers balanced mutual funds for as little at 0.07%, doesn\u2019t currently have an all-in-one ETF in the U.S., but has a handful of allocation ETFs in Canada. The products currently have assets of $2.1 billion Canadian (US$1.5 billion).\n\n\u201cThe traditional buyer of balanced funds hasn\u2019t shown up yet in the U.S. ETF market,\u201d says Rich Powers, head of ETF product management for Vanguard, \u201cbut we\u2019re still in the early innings.\u201d\n\nFactors to Consider When Buying An All-Inclusive ETF Underlying holdings: Most asset-allocation ETFs hold and rebalance using other ETFs, for simplicity, but a handful hold investments in stocks, bonds and commodity futures directly. Asset mix: An allocation of 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds is a long-established baseline for balanced investment funds. A higher share of stocks means more risk, but investments in commodities, real-estate investment trusts and high-yield bonds can bring other risks outside of stocks. Expense ratio: For ETFs of ETFs, look at the net expense ratio. This should include management fees and acquired fund fees. Some ETFs waive management fees or underlying fund fees, dependent upon the mix of securities in the portfolio. Investment strategy: Terms like growth, income and even balanced permeate these strategies. Some are actively managed and others are indexed, so be sure to read the prospectus. Tax efficiency: The ETF structure helps these funds stay tax-efficient when it comes to capital gains, whether they hold other ETFs or securities directly, but investing in bonds (or bond ETFs) means that some portion of the ETF distributions will be taxed as ordinary dividends.\n\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in Connecticut.
