The country needed Pence to keep himself clean, as Ford did, and instead\u2014whether out of raw ambition or some weak personal impulse to subservience\u2014Pence plunged into the deepest ooze of the mud. Maybe he struggled to keep his distance, maybe he obeyed only reluctantly, or maybe he eagerly volunteered to ingratiate himself with his crooked boss. That part of the story will all come out.\n\nFor now, all we need to say is that Pence betrayed his most important duty as vice president: Be ready to step into the nation\u2019s highest office should the need arise. He\u2019s as much a part of the problem as Trump is, and Pence\u2019s personal choices ensure that the scandal of the century will continue to rip apart U.S. politics even if the impeachment process somehow succeeds.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Frum", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Mike-Pences-Role-Ukraine-Scandal-Disgraceful"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
