After bringing baby Archie to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Wednesday, Prince Harry and Meghan went separate ways on Thursday.\n\nHarry was in Botswana, getting a firsthand look at conservation and wildlife preservation projects, while Meghan stayed in Cape Town, South Africa to visit with local women's groups.\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reported, Meghan was going solo for the next few days to host a number of private engagements. On Thursday it was a breakfast for women in public service, including politicians and community activists.\n\nPrince Harry was touring in neighboring Botswana \u2014 the country where he and Meghan fell in love. But it was no romantic getaway for the prince this time; he was there to see efforts in wildlife conservation, and he alluded to the fact that he wasn't the only person using some \"star power\" to highlight environmental issues.\n\n\"This last week, led by Greta, the world's children are striking,\" Harry said. \"There's an emergency, there's a race against time and one in which we are losing.\"\n\nGreta Thunberg on the \"advantage\" of Asperger's in fighting climate change: \"We need people who think outside the box\"\n\nBut Botswana may be one of the winners; the country has been seen as a shining example of African wildlife conservation because of its zero-tolerance policy to poaching.\n\nThe Duke also joined school children planting trees in the Chobe Forest Reserve, and then met a youth group who are part of his Sentebale Project.\n\nSentebale, which means \"Forget Me Not,\" is one of Harry's deepest passions. Co-founded by him in 2006, the organization improves the lives of those living with HIV and AIDS, and it continues the legacy of Harry's mother Princess Diana, who fought to de-stigmatize the virus.\n\nHarry spoke movingly about how Botswana helped him in the tough months after his mom's death, and the lifelong bond it created.\n\n\"I came here in '97, '98, straight after my mum died, so it was a nice place to get away from it all, but now I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa,\" Harry said.\n\nPatta said that connection will be even more firmly cemented on Friday, when Prince Harry travels to Angola and where he will literally walk in his mother's footsteps.\n\nBritain's Princess Diana wearing a heavy duty protection vest and face shield, is accompanied by a mine-clearing expert of the Halo Trust, January 15, 1997, during her visit to the mine fields near Huambo, where she watched mine-clearing operations in an area once on the frontline of the Angolan civil war.
