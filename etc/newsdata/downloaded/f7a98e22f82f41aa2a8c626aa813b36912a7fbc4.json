He says very clearly that the war cannot be compared at all to a game of chess, that war is a totally dirty detestable affair,\" Jacques Bechtold said.\n\nTolstoy once lived in Geneva in a villa which is now used by the United Nations.\n\nEstablished after World War Two, the UN aims to promote peace by working with all the world's nations, multilaterally.\n\nThe exhibition is also marking a centenary of multilateralism which began in 1919 with an array of peace treaties and the setting up of the League of Nations after the First World War.\n\n\"For us, it\u2019s really restoring the lessons of the past, that we have to work for peace, work on all levels, and the only possibility now to work for peace is new multilateralism,\" said Tatiana Valovaya, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva.\n\nThe excerpt is on display at the Martin Bodmer Foundation in Geneva until March.", "description": "It's widely regarded as one of the finest novels ever written on humankind\u2019s conflicting desires to fight and live together.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/88/46/1000x563_cmsv2_0d85890b-1275-5b58-aeb7-85ff52b35915-4208846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
