Curious how other countries compare to each other? From India to France and beyond, here is what therapy is like around the world.\n\nThe U.K.\n\nDaniel Limpi / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nThe mentality around therapy has shifted in recent years, according to John Kenny, a transformational and relationship coach in Hertfordshire, U.K., who has worked in private practice with the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service for the past 12 years.\n\n\u201cIn the U.K. there has been a stigma placed on therapy for many years as we have a culture of the \u2018stiff upper up\u2019 to \u2018just get on with things\u2019 \u2018deal with it yourself\u2019 and \u2018we are not a nation of moaners,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that the many people in the country are generally on the more private side and adhere to a \u201cwhat happens behind closed doors stays there\u201d mentality.\n\n\u201cTherapy has been seen as a weakness because of this, but this idea is slowly changing now that mental health issues are being seen as a major issue within the U.K.,\u201d Kenny said.\n\nSarah Floyd with No Panic Sheffield, a U.K. charity that provides mental health assistance to those with anxiety disorders, says therapy is definitely more acceptable. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d almost be inclined to say it\u2019s starting to become fashionable, just like having a personal trainer became fashionable eight to 10 years ago. Now it\u2019s all about having some kind of therapist,\u201d she said.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy tends to be the preferred therapy employed by the NHS \u201cdue to the fact you can get statistical data and quantify any success,\u201d Kenny said. This type of therapy encourages a patient to change their thinking and behavior patterns through exercises in sessions and outside of them.\n\n\u201cAccessing psychotherapy in the NHS is mostly through being referred by your general practitioner,\u201d said Patricia Hunt, a psychotherapist and international officer of the U.K. Council for Psychotherapy. This is mainly used to treat anxiety and mild depression. \u201cThe initial offer is usually six sessions of 50-60 minutes, and extended where needed to 12 sessions.\u201d\n\nPatients also have the option to seek out therapy through a private practitioner, which covers a much wider range of therapeutic approaches for people dealing with depression, relationship issues, trauma and more, Hunt said. These can also be offered on a short or long-term basis.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nKenny has seen a lot of people in the U.K. turn to mental health services to treat anxiety, depression and relationship issues.\n\n\u201cThe world is changing and us humans don\u2019t do well with change, hence the rise in people seeking out help [through therapy or life coaching],\u201d added Floyd.\n\nCosts\n\nThe NHS provides free therapy sessions to patients, however, they \u201ccurrently have waiting lists that can go on for over a year,\u201d according to Kenny.\n\nHunt said the cost of private psychotherapy typically ranges from 25 to 50 euros (around $27 to $55) per session, but many psychotherapists have a variable rate to make psychotherapy available to those who need it. She added that psychotherapy sessions are not typically covered by insurance in the U.K., but the U.K. Council for Psychotherapy has worked in collaboration with other psychotherapy and counseling organizations to encourage health insurance companies to include therapy in coverage.\n\nMexico\n\n\u00a9fitopardo.com via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nOver time, there has been a greater acceptance of therapy in Mexico, said Jaime Gonz\u00e1lez-Paullada, a psychologist with R&A Psic\u00f3logos. He noted that while you can still hear comments such as \u201cpsychotherapy is for crazy people\u201d or \u201ctherapy doesn\u2019t work,\u201d people are becoming more aware of what therapy represents and its importance.\n\n\u201cPsychotherapy is more distributed in urban than rural areas, and also in major cities,\u201d he said. There are also public institutions throughout the country that \u201coffer a very affordable service of psychotherapy for the population,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Paullada said.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nThere is typically a heavy focus on CBT in Mexico, said Claudia Vidal Ortiz, a family therapist in Mexico City.\n\nShe added that long-term therapy is typically more expensive and many people can\u2019t afford it. However, the public system does provide some psychological support in their clinics. Women\u2019s organizations also provide psychological support, particularly around issues of violence.\n\nCommon Issues\n\n\u201cSome people attend therapy due to a specific issue like depression ... others may go regularly like every week or sporadically like once a month just to check in or have some follow up with a few topics,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Paullada said.\n\nCosts\n\nInsurance companies don\u2019t cover therapy services in Mexico, nor do any government dependencies, Gonz\u00e1lez-Paullada said. \u201cSo every person attending therapy pays their own sessions from their pockets.\u201d\n\nHe added that there are several foundations, hospitals and colleges that offer therapy at a low cost (around 50 pesos, or about $2.50) as well as some private clinics. \u201cThe cost can range can vary from 300 to 2,000 pesos ($15 to $100). It depends on several factors like the zone or the specialization,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Paullada said.\n\nBrazil\n\nPakawat Thongcharoen via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\n\u201cTherapy still has a stigma here,\u201d said Desir\u00e9e Cassado, a psychologist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nCassado also noted that therapy is more common in urban areas like Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThe populations of these cities are richer and have more access to better professionals,\u201d she said.\n\nJuliana Helena Bruno Machado, a psychologist with S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s N\u00facleo Interface said at this point, \u201cpeople would rather talk to their pastors and priests\u201d rather than see a mental health professional.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\n\u201cMost of Brazilian psychologists tend to work with psychoanalysis and other humanistic approaches,\u201d Cassado said. (Psychoanalysis is essentially based on the thought that people are motivated by unrecognized wishes or desires that stem from your subconscious.)\n\nCommon Issues\n\nCassado noted that people tend to come for an appointment when they are experiencing major issues with depression, anxiety, divorce and other relationship issues. Usually patients come in through referrals. \u201cBrazil, especially S\u00e3o Paulo State, has one of the highest rates of depression and anxiety disorders,\u201d she said. And Brazilian patients tend to stay in therapy for somewhere between six to 18 months, she added.\n\nCosts\n\nCassado said psychotherapy is typically private and expensive. A few years ago, a law passed demanding the inclusion of therapy in private health insurance plans. \u201cThe state also offers therapy and some mental health assistance, but they tend to be insufficient for the high demand,\u201d she explained.\n\nAccording to Cassado, private therapy appointments can range from 87 to 501 Brazilian reals ($20 to $120), depending on the country\u2019s region and the expertise of the therapist. Machado explained that the public services for mental health provided in hospitals and psychiatry wards often have lengthy wait times for treatment, making private therapy, \u201ca high-cost treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome insurances cover part of the costs of the sessions, others have their own affiliated therapists,\u201d Cassado added. With coverage, people usually pay as little as 42 reals ($10) per session to the therapist and sessions are limited to 40 a year.\n\nFrance\n\nJacobs Stock Photography Ltd via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nThe popularity of therapy in France is very generational, said Anastasia Piatakhina Gir\u00e9, an integrative psychotherapist practicing in Paris. She noted that the country\u2019s older population still has a stigma around the practice.\n\n\u201cSo they would probably mostly go if there is a crisis like an illness or cancer,\u201d she said. The younger folks, however, are much more open to mental health treatments. \u201cThey don\u2019t wait until a crisis really happens. They maybe do more maintenance therapy,\u201d Gir\u00e9 said. \u201cThe French definitely do less therapy than Americans. That\u2019s for sure. But it\u2019s slowly catching on.\u201d\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nThe main type of therapy in France, according to Gir\u00e9, is psychoanalytical psychotherapy.\n\nThis is \u201ca psychotherapy approach rooted in psychoanalytical theory and tradition. The closest by American standards is probably psychodynamic psychotherapy,\u201d Anastasia said. The therapist will have the client acknowledge and understand any contradictory feelings and repressed emotions they may be experiencing. This type of approach is often used to treat depression.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nPeople go to therapy for many reasons, but the main struggles Gir\u00e9 has observed in her practice are relationship issues, anxiety, depression and an existential crisis. \u201cGoing through any kind of change, which can be age, retirement, losing a job or losing a family member, can also trigger a lot of new responses,\u201d she said.\n\nGir\u00e9\u2019s youngest clients are typically in their 30s, a generation she said that is embracing therapy much more than their predecessors. \u201cThis group comes in for a lot of work-related issues. Often there is some kind of relational difficulty or relational dynamic at work. And usually, there is also something in their private lives that reflects the same issue,\u201d she explained.\n\nCosts\n\nGir\u00e9 told HuffPost that people can see a psychiatrist for free through France\u2019s healthcare system. This is typically a 10-minute appointment that will simply involve the doctor prescribing them with a dose of medication.\n\nSome psychiatrists do therapy sessions through this program as well, however, these are harder to find. If a person is referred by their general practitioner for a specific ailment, like depression, they can see a psychologist for a limited number of sessions to treat those conditions. Most of the cost for these sessions may be covered by the public health care system, and private insurance, which can be offered by employers, can make up the difference.\n\nBecause of certain laws, some therapists \u2015 Gir\u00e9 is one of them \u2015 may not fall under this coverage umbrella. Anyone who wants to seek out private individual therapy with a psychotherapist in France must pay out of pocket to do so, Gir\u00e9 said.\n\n\u201cIf someone goes to a psycho-practitioner or psychotherapist, that\u2019s the private session where they can go to for anything like relationships, life issues and more of a daily maintenance. And those are out of their pocket, typically ranging from 70 to 120 euros ($77 to $132) per 50 minute session,\u201d she said.\n\nChina\n\nd3sign via Getty Images Beautiful Asian woman using mobile phone while crossing road in busy downtown city street at night\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nTherapy wasn\u2019t really acknowledged in China until a couple of decades ago, said Steven Vinay Gunther, a practicing psychotherapist in Shanghai. It\u2019s grown in popularity in the last 15 years or so, especially through psychological workshops.\n\n\u201cThere are people who get on the circuit and go from one workshop to the other,\u201d he said, adding that therapy in China is not completely developed as a profession yet. \u201cBut there\u2019s increasing interest, partly because of the increasing middle class with disposable incomes and common psychological problems that people no longer feel they have to suffer through but find there is something that they can do about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe practice is definitely more popular in the bigger cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai, said Titi Hill, a counselor and psychotherapist in Shanghai. Hill noted that \u201clarger urban areas have more services available to the public.\u201d\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nGunther has seen the most buzz around workshop structures (think group therapy-type settings). \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a wide range of people attend these workshops \u2015 housewives, business people, some professionals. I always get a mix at mine,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate therapy, he said, is much less common and caters to a very small number of people who are willing to do it and can afford it. \u201cIt\u2019s increasing, but still much smaller than the workshop market,\u201d he said.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nGunther said patients find therapy for a number of reasons. \u201cSome of the main sources of suffering are unaddressed trauma from the cultural revolution,\u201d he said, adding that the family-rearing practices and growing up without a main caregiver can also create problems.\n\nHe added that relationship problems are also common, particularly with having extended family play a role in an adult child\u2019s lifelong decisions, such as who the adult child will wed. He also treats patients for intimacy issues.\n\n\u201cStress also brings a lot of people in, because they are a hardworking and work long hours,\u201d Hill added.\n\nCosts\n\nWorkshops range in price. It depends on who it\u2019s with and things. It can be anywhere from 1,429 to 2,858 yuan, or $200 to $400, a day, Gunther said.\n\n\u201cI run smaller ones but often there are like 20 to 30 people in some of mine. Often there are 60 to 70 people, sometimes hundreds in these workshops though,\u201d he said.\n\nGunther added that a very small number of people, like some expats, might have some insurance, but typically private therapy is paid for out of pocket. Prices can range from $30 an hour for a local therapist to $400 an hour for a more credentialed expert.\n\nOther Parts Of Asia\n\nMatteo Colombo via Getty Images\n\nHill noted that therapy differs greatly across other parts of Asia. Japan, for instance, \u201cis very much a culture where people don\u2019t express on the outside what they feel on the inside. So that produces a very complex set of issues ... often people in Japan will have issues that they don\u2019t ever talk to anybody about,\u201d Gunther said.\n\nGunther said that group therapy tends to be the popular modality in Japan and estimated that sessions likely range from 4,250 to 21,252 yen ($40 to $200).\n\nIn Thailand, an outpatient therapy session would likely be a minimum of 1,500 baht ($49), said Reeya Chaicharas, head of marketing for The Dawn, a mental health services center in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nCanada\n\nKatrin Ray Shumakov via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nTherapy in Canada is widely accepted, especially in larger cities. \u201cDue to everyone having provincial health insurance, people are much more open and accepting of private pay therapy as it is one of the few things that they do have to pay for,\u201d said Andrew Sofin, president of the Canadian Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, who offers psychotherapy for couples in Montreal.\n\nSofin noted that the majority of Canadians who are experiencing something like depression or trauma will seek out some form of therapy either through the public or private system. \u201cThere is a subsection of the population, mainly in the urban areas, where people will also go to therapy for maintenance, vent about their day or just check in. This therapy is only available in the private pay system,\u201d he added.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nCanada offers a variety of therapy options, with approaches ranging from psychoanalysis, to music therapy, to art therapy, to sand play.\n\n\u201cWe all learn differently and the ways in which we express ourselves vary as well. The range of modalities available reflect these differences,\u201d explained Gord McLeod, president of the Canadian Association of Psychodynamic Therapy.\n\nCommon Issues\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes consider therapy as an option when life events stir up emotions and thoughts that interfere with one\u2019s normal day-to-day activities,\u201d McLeod said. He added that sometimes people recognize a pattern of behaviors that is not healthy but are unable to make the needed change and that people also seek therapy if they\u2019re experiencing more anxiety than normal.\n\nCosts\n\nIf you are accessing therapy through the provincial health care or social services system, it is free. If it is through a private pay provider, it can range from 60 to 300 CAD (around $45 to $224) depending on where you live and the expertise or popularity of the provider.\n\n\u201cIn most big cities it will range from 100 to 150 CAD, or $75 to $112, for an experienced therapist. Many providers, as well as private and partially publicly-funded agencies, will also offer a sliding fee scale based on the client\u2019s income,\u201d Sofin said.\n\nIndia\n\nphruetthiphong pawarachan via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nIn India, the concept of therapy itself is quite new and unfamiliar for most people, said Vandita Dubey, a clinical psychologist who practices in the Indian Himalayas and Gurgaon. \u201cWhen people seek therapy in India, they are typically seeking advice,\u201d she said.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nDubey said people are not well-versed with the different therapy modalities, so there isn\u2019t necessarily one preferred method. Psychotherapy, while popular in other countries, isn\u2019t totally well-known, either.\n\n\u201cThere is no regulatory body at the state or national level or licensing requirements in place,\u201d Dubey said. \u201cMany practitioners of therapy in India have no professional training or may have done a one-year distance program in counseling, at the most.\u201d\n\nInstead, therapy in India typically includes anything from past life regression (which focuses on hypnosis and guiding a patient back in time to face earlier memories) to NLP (neuro-linguistic programming, which incorporates language and sensory-based interventions and behavior-modification techniques). There are professionals who do use CBT, psychoanalysis and other research-backed methods as well.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nMost people who seek therapy expect a professional to provide life advice or help solve a problem, Dubrey said.\n\nShe added that people in India looking for help with depression or anxiety often expect to be prescribed medication of some sort when they see a professional. Families also typically want to know what\u2019s being discussed, which may impede progress.\n\n\u201cPeople also turn up looking for treatment for someone else who has not come to the therapist\u2019s office \u2015 a child, spouse, parent, etc. \u2015 and want the therapist to provide a diagnosis and prescribe some form of treatment for the absent person. In general, there is still a great deal of stigma associated with seeking therapy, even in the big cities,\u201d she explained.\n\nCosts\n\nThe clients typically pay out of pocket. Insurance almost never covers psychotherapy.\n\n\u201cHowever, a directive issued by the government in 2018 has asked insurance agencies to provide coverage for mental health \u2015 the time frame and details of coverage have not been specified,\u201d Dubey said.\n\n\u201cThe typical range of therapy rates in India is approximately $7 to $45 per therapy hour,\u201d she added.\n\nItaly\n\nPhoto by cuellar via Getty Images\n\nWhat Stigma Is Like\n\nTherapy in Italy has not been completely normalized quite yet, said Paolo Molino, a psychologist and psychotherapist in Florence.\n\n\u201cThe culture imposes that you have to have a problem to justify the fact that you are in a therapist\u2019s practice,\u201d he said, noting that it isn\u2019t generally understood that seeing a therapist supports for your overall well-being, but rather there\u2019s \u201ca culture of \u2018I have a damage, let me go and fix it,\u2019\u201d Molino said.\n\nBut Francesco-Maria Serino, founder of Doctors in Italy, a digital platform that connects patients to English-speaking doctors and therapists, noted that times are slowly changing and psychotherapy is becoming more accepted.\n\n\u201cIt is still difficult to find psychotherapists in small towns but, at the moment, all the biggest cities in Italy have a good number of psychotherapists working either in public services or private offices,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut despite the increasing number of psychotherapists, there is definitely still a stigma around seeking a therapist.\n\n\u201cPeople commonly believe that psychotherapy is only appropriate for very severe conditions, and they are reluctant to ask for psychological help even when it is direly needed,\u201d he said, adding that one of the reasons for this persisting stigma is that there is not enough media coverage on the importance of seeking out therapy.\n\nPopular Types Of Therapy\n\nThe most common types of therapy in Italy are psychodynamic therapy and CBT, Serino said. He added, however, that all other common approaches can be found in Italy.\n\n\u201cIndividual therapy is definitely more popular than group therapy, possibly also in connection with the stigma of seeking help and the desire to keep it as private as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nIn Italy, people seek out therapy in a private setting mostly for issues related to anxiety, depression, eating disorders and relationship conflicts.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorders with severe emotional dysregulation, the public services are usually primarily involved in the treatment,\u201d Serino said.\n\nPeople often start psychotherapy in private settings to tackle specific issues \u2015 like a recent panic attack, or the end of a relationship or a divorce \u2015 but then they realize that psychotherapy can also be a tool for growth and self-discovery, he added.\n\n\u201cPeople who have gone through psychotherapy find it easier to come back to seek further help also for other minor issues and in different phases of their life. It is unusual, however, to meet people who continue therapy for maintenance,\u201d Serino explained.\n\nCosts\n\nThe cost of a session in a private setting can vary from 50 euros to 150 euros ($55 to $165) and \u201cthe majority of people undergoing therapy in a private office have to pay out of pocket,\u201d Serino said.\n\nHe added that very few Italian insurances cover psychotherapy and mental health at the moment. People do have the option of using low-cost public psychotherapy services, but the downside to this is that there\u2019s often a waiting list and inflexible appointment times.", "description": "Examining how countries like France, Italy and Mexico view mental health can help us understand why people see therapists.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d728448230000330051260d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
