And it\u2019s now clearer than ever that this core material dimension must suffuse any serious invocation of the word.\n\nThe idea first emerged in the legal books of the ancient Roman Empire. When people held a debt in common, they were said to hold it \u201cin solidum.\u201d In other words, the state of being on the hook as a group was the basis of solidarity. If one individual faltered, the group had to step up\u2014meaning that its members would be either bailing one another out or defaulting together. Thus, from its genesis, solidarity had a financial component that raised the stakes. In this original formulation, solidarity is a common identity underpinned by collective indebtedness and obligation, shared responsibility and shared risk, a state of interdependence and mutual aid. Terms like \u201cbonds\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cmutual funds\u201d are now used by bankers to describe financial structures and agreements; solidarity turns such notions around to strengthen the ties among a community of debtors instead of affirming a contract with a creditor.\n\nUnlike identity, solidarity is not something you have, it is something you do\u2014a set of actions taken toward a common goal.\n\nAfter its brief appearance in ancient Roman law, solidarity was mostly forgotten until the modern age. In the 1700s, a reorganization began taking place across Europe. The question emerged: What would hold society together without God or King? As monarchy and religious orthodoxy came into question, how were people to refashion society under new norms?\n\nIn France, the concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity formed a trinity of values that would guide the revolution. But the conception of fraternity itself proved limited. It implied a blood kinship that was inadequate to the modern, pluralistic nation-state. The French politician L\u00e9on Bourgeois asked: Is solidarity \u201cjust a new word, a change of language? Or does this word express a truly new idea, and indicate an evolution in thought?\u201d It seemed that the idea of solidarity, while it resembled fraternity, was something quite different. Fraternity was believed to be natural, innate. Solidarity, by contrast, had to be cultivated: It was the practice of creating social ties, actively inventing collective identity.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the term became central to the fledgling labor movement. Craftsmen from an array of industries, who once saw themselves as separate, as cobblers or bricklayers, began to see themselves as sharing a larger, common character: They were all workers. With industrialization, this shared identity could be fostered on the factory floor. But it was through acts of resistance, especially militant strikes, that this common bond became a source of leverage, a force that could change the conditions under which one toils.\n\nAs the labor movement began gaining traction\u2014agitating along to the theme of the movement\u2019s anthem, \u201cSolidarity Forever\u201d\u2014the French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim also set out to discover what created solidarity and held societies together. Durkheim writes that solidarity is generated through a shared sense of the sacred. Every society, he observes, has a set of rituals around what its members consider sacred or profane. And these rituals\u2014these sets of collective actions\u2014knit us together. (The late\u2013nineteenth-century American socialist Edward Bellamy, author of the classic utopian novel Looking Backward, built on the same set of social assumptions in advancing his idea of a spiritually infused brand of American nationalism\u2014something he dubbed \u201cthe religion of solidarity.\u201d)\n\nBut these inchoate understandings of social belonging soon began to erode under the corrosive pressures of modern industrial life. Modernity made the individual sacred, producing a paradoxical effect that still hangs over us. We are held together by our recognition of individual rights\u2014yet our individualism is overpowering our sense of community and starting to eat away at the fabric of society.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the term \u201csolidarity\u201d became more frequently associated with efforts on behalf of one group to express a commitment to another. We see the term used increasingly in conjunction with international campaigns in support of communities that are resisting either oppressive governments, or the oppressive actions of their own governments upon others. The Central American Solidarity Movement emerged in the 1980s, and recruited citizens of the United States to support the people of Nicaragua and El Salvador, fighting together against U.S. interventions in Latin America. The International Solidarity Movement was created to support Palestinians in their fight for recognition and statehood. In these cases, solidarity was not an expression of empathy or benevolence, but the response required by an understanding of one\u2019s own unacceptable complicity.\n\nIn Poland, where the term is often associated with the movement \u201cSolidarnosc,\u201d solidarity was upheld as the thread knitting together workers, community members, and the Church. It denoted a concerted effort to bridge the many segments of society to create a movement against Soviet control of the state and for worker-led socialism. As J\u00f3zef Tischner, the movement chaplain, wrote, \u201cSolidarity means to carry one another\u2019s burden.\u201d Unfortunately, in Poland\u2019s effort to adopt this social ideal, the \u201cinternational community\u201d encouraged the movement\u2019s leaders to pursue a neoliberal approach to economic development\u2014and ultimately, that initiative undermined the transformative potential of the movement.\n\nWhether in Poland or here in the United States, the neoliberal model promotes the market as the solution to our political ills, the path to efficiency, prosperity, and individual freedom. Under capitalism more generally, our daily rituals of buying and selling and trying to get ahead become the only practices that unite us. And this has meant that, instead of solidarity connecting us across difference, the language of exchange, of spending and investing, has increasingly become our common tongue. Whereas the revolutionary ideal of democracy sought a way to connect us as citizens, now the market ties us together as consumers\u2014and simultaneously pushes us apart. Profit is sacred. Poverty is profane. Solidarity disappears.\n\nThat is, of course, precisely the point. Political and economic elites fear nothing more than the plebs of the world uniting to challenge their rule, which is what sublime solidarity aims to do. Marx and Engels movingly envisioned a form of class solidarity extending across borders and nationalities, yoking together strangers alienated and exploited by the same economic forces. Sadly, this exalted, transformative version of solidarity has only fitfully manifested and proved difficult to maintain, in large part because plutocrats and politicians have mastered a strategy of divide and conquer.\n\nThe quote often attributed to robber baron Jay Gould\u2014\u201cI can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half\u201d\u2014may never have been uttered by the man, but the basic sentiment holds. Fearing the power of solidarity, employers foment divisions among their workers, typically along racial, ethnic, and gendered lines. (In his excellent 2011 book Carbon Democracy, historian Timothy Mitchell describes how oil companies at the dawn of the twentieth century encouraged ethnic and racial conflict among their labor force in order to weaken it, creating \u201cseparate racial groups, with managers, skilled workers and unskilled workers housed and treated separately\u201d in order to keep wages low and revenue high.) As Asad Haider argues in his 2018 study Mistaken Identity, racism\u2019s primary function is to divide the exploited, producing hierarchies of privilege and redirecting anger away from employers, and the capitalist class more broadly, toward other social groups, who are seen as competitors and threats instead of potential comrades.\n\nSolidarity is the antidote to this sort of division; its practice permits otherwise isolated political actors to transcend their own limited personal experiences and build coalitions. But precisely because these coalitions are what the powerful fear most, they have taken extraordinary steps to make solidarity illegal. The limit-case of this strategy was 1947\u2019s Taft-Hartley Act, which rolled back many of the basic collective-bargaining provisions secured during the heyday of the New Deal. Indeed, when the act was signed into law, Businessweek heralded it as nothing less than a \u201cNew Deal for America\u2019s Employers.\u201d Among its other provisions, the law prohibited jurisdictional and wildcat strikes as well as secondary boycotts or pickets\u2014in other words, it drastically curtailed the right of workers to engage in solidarity action. \u201cThe law\u2019s ban on secondary boycotts and strikes undermined local solidarity, especially in metropolitan settings where smaller, place-based locals had historically engaged in mutual strategic and political support,\u201d historian Colin Gordon explains. Union members found themselves legally bound to fight only for themselves, which defies one of the foundational tenets of union membership: that an injury to one is an injury to all. Today, the Supreme Court is positioned to advance the right\u2019s war on solidarity through further attacks on labor unions, following the recent Janus decision, which took aim at the ability of unions to collect dues. (Meanwhile, in the U.K., the Labour Party is pushing a proposal to allow sympathy strikes, so that domestic workers can agitate on behalf of workers abroad.)\n\nIn the absence of any coherent social ethos of solidarity, the rich will always ask why they should have to \u201cgive\u201d to undeserving others, and balk at having to pay their fair share.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only collective, organized manifestations of solidarity that are imperiled. Even private, spontaneous gestures of kindness must be squelched. Across Europe and in the United States, voluntary action to help migrants, including those on the brink of death, is forbidden. A French farmer was tried in 2017 for housing migrants (though the court later ruled that his action was legitimate on the basis of \u201cfraternity\u201d), while a Swedish journalist was dubbed a \u201chuman trafficker\u201d and fined for helping a 15-year-old Syrian get to Sweden in 2014. In the United States, meanwhile, a government lawyer in Marfa, Texas, was arrested in February 2019 for giving a ride to three siblings, including an ill teenager, that she saw on the side of the road, and an Arizona activist faced 20 years in prison for providing clothing and shelter to those in need\u2014\u201charboring certain aliens\u201d in the dehumanizing language of the law. (His trial resulted in a hung jury.) Many Western societies now treat it as a crime to answer the call of one\u2019s conscience\u2014and have enacted draconian penalties for committing an act of solidarity.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given its original coinage within the ancient Roman credit systems, solidarity reemerged in eighteenth-century political discourse in conjunction with questions of debt. But this time around, the focus broadened beyond specific lending arrangements to ask: Who owes what to whom?\n\nIn 1900, a conference in France addressed the political ideal. Stephen Lukes, the British political theorist and biographer of \u00c9mile Durkheim, writes, \u201cThe Congress concluded with a resolution stating the meaning and implications of the notion of solidarit\u00e9\u2014the idea of justice as the repayment of a \u2018social debt\u2019 by the privileged to the underprivileged, assuming mutual interdependence and quasi-contractual obligations between all citizens and implying a programme of public education, social insurance, and labour and welfare legislation.\u201d In 1895, L\u00e9on Bourgeois wrote, \u201cMan is born a debtor to humanity.\u201d From the moment we enter the world, Bourgeois notes, we are bound into webs of relationships\u2014past and future. And solidarity, he argues, is the expression of the intrinsic debts we have to one another.\n\nSolidarity was central to arguments justifying the creation of social safety nets, as well as to the idea that taxes are how we pay the social debts we are all born owing. And at the level of direct organizing, solidarity furnished the framework for the grassroots movements\u2014which preached the need for solidarity and practiced it in deed\u2014that successfully fought for such entitlements from below.\n\nThe modern welfare state was a massive breakthrough. Unfortunately, however, today\u2019s social services are run more on the model of charity\u2014invoked via a far less democratic and accountable social ideal of liberal beneficence\u2014than radical solidarity. In the absence of any coherent social ethos of solidarity, the rich will always ask why they should have to \u201cgive\u201d to undeserving others, and balk at having to pay their fair share. And then there is the problem of how the state operates once it is fully funded. Currently, the state is set up as a provider of services, a dispenser of welfare to recipients, as opposed to something that grants regular people any direct stake in its operations or ownership. In popular mythology, the government is portrayed as a monster, seizing private property through taxation, or as a smothering mother, the infamous nanny state.\n\nThese guiding tropes are all in play in the emerging debate over the Green New Deal. Solidarity, the building of bonds and diverse coalitions, will be essential to the struggle for a more ecologically sustainable and economically just world. At the same time, of course, the powerful forces heavily invested in the status quo will push back with all their might, pitting us against one another and buying off the relatively privileged, who may delusively believe they can weather the gathering storm alone.\n\nBut solidarity should infuse not just the fight but our understanding of what we are fighting for. Where the original New Deal brought Americans the welfare state, including services such as Social Security and unemployment insurance, the Green New Deal could usher in the era of what we might call the solidarity state\u2014a state that not only redistributes resources to \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d but also democratizes control over how those resources are produced, allocated, and managed. A solidarity state demands both shared sacrifice and shared reward.\n\nAnd this is the enormous challenge ahead: The Green New Deal we need will not be charity granted from on high by enlightened rulers, but something won through a determined campaign of collective self-liberation. Like the debtors in Rome 2,000 years ago, we must bail one another out, this time as the sea levels continue rising around us.
