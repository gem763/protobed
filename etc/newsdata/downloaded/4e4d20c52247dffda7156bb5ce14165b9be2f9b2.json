I\u2019m not going to storm anything, certainly not involving a military base\u2026\u201d\n\nAt 54, Thompson, the lycanthropic visionary at the heart of alt-rock legends and proto-grunge pioneers Pixies, seems an unapologetic realist. The sci-fi nut who took the alien\u2019s eye view on \u201cPlanet of Sound\u201d and \u201cMotorway To Roswell\u201d and raced to meet the mothership landing on the Vegas Strip in \u201cThe Happening\u201d in the early Nineties has clearly matured out of his sky-watching ways. Any talk of witchcraft, reincarnation and death curses that appear on Pixies new seventh album Beneath The Eyrie he dismisses as \u201ctheatrical affectation\u201d, the biblical bawler of classic early albums Surfer Rosa and Doolittle stepping back from his dark art.\n\nHe\u2019s reluctant to talk politics, too. \u201cLife is short and I need to choose my battles,\u201d he says when I bring up Trump. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? Do I really need to say the guy seems like he\u2019s a f***in\u2019 piece of work? What the hell can I possibly say that\u2019s gonna illuminate anyone about anything to do with this subject?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWell, the (seminal, Nirvana-influencing) full-length debut Surfer Rosa was full of songs in tune with Latin American culture, the very people that Potus is now demonising.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been like that,\u201d Thompson argues. \u201cI\u2019m not saying every president has done that, but there\u2019s a president or a king or a leader somewhere in the world right now that\u2019s demonising some other group of people that aren\u2019t from their particular part of the map for whatever the reason, because they\u2019re racist or xenophobic or they have some sort of political or economic agenda they\u2019re trying to drive. That goes on every year somewhere in the world. Now there\u2019s some guy who is the president who seems to say a lot of things via his bombastic Twitter feed, oh great, we\u2019re already doing enough bombast on people\u2019s Twitter feeds and social media these days, goddamn it all, now the actual president of a country is utilising it too. I suppose it would make sense that that would happen, but it is sort of like \u2018oh brother, the world really is going to hell in a hand basket.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s equally pragmatic about those people who claim Pixies just aren\u2019t Pixies without their original bassist Kim Deal, who quit the reformed band in 2013, reportedly reluctant to taint their legacy with new albums.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say if that\u2019s how they view it, I\u2019m perfectly OK with that,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of other records to listen to and lots of other bands to follow. They don\u2019t need to keep following the Pixies if they think it\u2019s dead and over without a particular member, I get it. I suppose there are bands out there that I like that maybe I liked certain versions of the band better than other versions of the band, shall we say? But there are also bands I like \u2013 for example, the band Love from the Sixties, they\u2019ve always got the same frontman but the backing band changes. People talk about certain earlier records that they made that have the quintessential line-up, a particular guitar player or whomever, and that is \u2018the good stuff\u2019 \u2013 I would argue that that may be for you, but for me as a listener a couple of their later records are my favourite records. If they only like a certain period of the band, great, I\u2019m glad that they like some of it, they don\u2019t have to like it all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Team Kim are set to miss out big time. The Pixies of 2019 are making some of the best, most evocative music of their career, steeped in the macabre spirit of their formative records. Take Thompson\u2019s new guitar. A jet-black, customised guitar strung with just four strings like a diabolic banjo. And there in the headstock, set in resin, a human tooth streaming roots.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, I had lost my very first adult tooth,\u201d Thomspon says, intoning like a fireside storytelling reading from a book of terror tales. \u201cA very large molar. I received the tooth from the dentist intact, with all its roots. So I went to the guitar maker and said, \u2018can you build me this customised four-string guitar, let\u2019s do it in black. But I asked him to embed the tooth in the guitar, so he floated it in resin in the headstock. So this guitar has a kind of a vibe.\u201d\n\nEver since they emerged from the Boston underground in 1987 with their flamenco-infused songs of mania, melody and menace, Pixies have been masters of the malevolent \u201cvibe\u201d. The moniker itself was a stroke of Guillermo del Toro genius \u2013 the sweet and playful turned sordid, supernatural, sinister \u2013 and their records were steeped in art house atmospherics. The deviant sex, deformity, religion, incest and exotic travelogues of 1988\u2019s Surfer Rosa came awash with a seamy Latin American heat-haze and a south-of-the-border lawlessness. The 1989 million-selling Doolittle was danker still, all myth and mutilation played out like the world\u2019s most tuneful death cult. The more sci-fi albums of Pixies\u2019 first incarnation \u2013 1990\u2019s Bossanova and 1991\u2019s Trompe Le Monde \u2013 created craterous planets of sound, by turns Plan 9 From Outer Space and a Starship Troopers battle scene. Before the band imploded from in-fighting in 1992 \u2013 drummer Dave Lovering and Deal were notified that they were out of a job by fax in January 1993 \u2013 they seemed to exist in a series of colourfully creepy worlds entirely their own.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 40 best albums to listen to before you die Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 40 best albums to listen to before you die 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH\n\nTwo fantastic comeback albums consolidated their 2004 reunion, imagining what sort of band they\u2019d be after a couple of decades stranded on the \u201cPlanet of Sound\u201d for 2014\u2019s wonderfully erratic Indie Cindy and then reconnecting with their grimy punk roots on Head Carrier in 2016. But it\u2019s only now that the reunited Pixies have once more submerged themselves in a \u201cvibe\u201d. With half an album written in rehearsals near Charles\u2019 home in Massachusetts and, as usual, no plan, they holed up in Dreamland Recording Studios, a converted church deep in the woods of upstate New York, there to commune with ancient American spirits.\n\n\u201cWe were there in the winter before Christmas,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWoodstock is a very moody place in the winter, it\u2019s very spooky, the studio we recorded at was an old church with a one-armed cross missing all the other limbs and lots of animals scurrying around in the walls of all the buildings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like \u2018the Pixies are out in Woodstock making a record in this church and they live in this cabin, broo-ha-ha!\u2019\u201d adds bassist Paz Lenchantin.\n\nSounds like there might\u2019ve been some Blair Witch moments during recording.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt should\u2019ve been really spooky because every single element of the studio was totally Headless Horseman, Ichabod Crane.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight in back of the church in the woods there was an old train track from the 1800s that was all grown in,\u201d recalls Lovering. \u201cWhen you walk to the train track you can get a glint of a giant eagle\u2019s nest, a bald eagle\u2019s nest. It\u2019s huge, quite a sight.\u201d\n\nThe nest gave Pixies\u2019 seventh album its title and the studio environs gave it its vibe: American gothic. \u201cWhen I arrived there for the session that was the vibe that we talked about, gothic,\u201d Thompson explains. \u201cSo whatever suggested that in the songwriting, we totally let it hang out. \u2018Make a record, and your improv word of the record is gothic, go!\u2019 We allowed that to flourish \u2013 to harken back to the so-called dark stories of the early Pixies repertoire, maybe there was something that felt a little bit gothic but felt right, like, \u2018we do that pretty good\u2019. There was a little bit of a sense of \u2018gothic is probably gonna be our friend in this batch of songs, so without trying too hard let\u2019s allow it to be there when it shows up, and if it does show up, let it fly.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe result is a record that feels like a yellowed storybook of 19th-century Americana, a compendium of fur-trader folklore, mid-western mythology and mountainfolk magick. Lenchantin\u2019s lyrics for first single \u201cOn Graveyard Hill\u201d concern a witch casting a curse over some wayward lover. \u201cSilver Bullet\u201d is the Byronesque tale of a condemned man wandering the night in search of a duel. The loping ragtime noir \u201cThis Is My Fate\u201d, a sozzled cousin of Doolittle\u2019s \u201cMr Grieves\u201d, is about an alcoholic mule train driver working out in Death Valley, hooked on mandrake root. \u201cThere\u2019s a Borax works out in the middle of Death Valley called Harmony, and these mule trains of 50 mules a day, they pull out,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cI wanted to intermingle with the spirit world, with life and death and with the mystical and a more surreal landscape.\u201d\n\nThe record is populated with dark fairy tales, from the \u201cselkie bride\u201d of \u201cSt Nazaire\u201d (\u201cThat\u2019s Gaelic folklore for the seal woman,\u201d Thompson explains, \u201ca man falls in love with her and she removes her seal coat and takes on human form \u2013 as long as her seal coat is preserved she can don it again and return to the sea\u201d) to the story of single of the year frontrunner \u201cCatfish Kate\u201d. The equal of any Pixies tune, it recounts an epic river battle between woman and catfish up in the mountains of South Dakota, as told by her boyfriend Black Jack Hooligan.\n\n\u201cI think the pedigree goes back to Scotland or whatever, the tales of Black Jack Hooligan. When I was a kid I\u2019d hear stories, and I\u2019m sure a lot of them were made up on the spot by my father, but there\u2019s a few it seemed like he\u2019d heard from somewhere and I\u2019ve carried them through. I was kinda stuck on a lyric and I just spontaneously said \u2018y\u2019know what, I don\u2019t know what people are gonna think about this but I\u2019m going to tell the story of Catfish Kate\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdd a spot of reincarnation into the mix in the form of the gorgeously spectral \u201cDaniel Boone\u201d, inspired by Thompson\u2019s near-collision with a deer en route to the studio, and one might start wondering if he has been dabbling in the supernatural himself of late.\n\n\u201cFor me, music and performing music is a theatrical kind of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWitches and ghosts and things like that are good enough for Shakespeare, so they\u2019re good enough for me. Doesn\u2019t everyone want to hear a spooky story, right? It\u2019s not a question of whether I believe in something or not. All you\u2019ve got to do is put on a history programme and ancient Brits and hear about what they believed and not be caught up in like, \u2018oh how interesting, they thought that blah-bladdy-blah blah blah blah blah\u2019. How could you not be attracted to that information? If you\u2019re writing something, then you\u2019re prone to incorporate that into your stew because how could you not? They\u2019re the human belief systems, it\u2019s not about what I believe.\u201d\n\nThe most telling autobiographical elements of Beneath The Eyrie are subliminal. Behind the album\u2019s scenes, Thompson was undergoing a marital breakdown, which unwittingly seeped into tracks such as \u201cIn the Arms of Mrs Mark of Cain\u201d and \u201cBird of Prey\u201d (\u201cYou\u2019ve stolen my tomorrow so I come for it today, you stole it when you stole my yesterday\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t even like I knew that that seemed to be happening in my life at the time,\u201d he confesses. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been performing a lot of these songs on the last tour we\u2019ve been on, it feels like, \u2018oh yeah, now I realise what this song is about\u2019. Even though it\u2019s maybe darker or sad or represents unhappy things in one\u2019s life, it feels very grounded because it\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019ve earned this, I\u2019ve earned the right to sing what I\u2019m singing\u2019.\u201d\n\nListen closely and you might even discern a little Morricone-inspired freshness in guitarist Joey Santiago\u2019s trademark wails and snarls, since he completed a rehab course in 2016.\u201cIt was kind of a different person [who made Head Carrier],\u201d Santiago says, \u201cbut someone who went back in his shoes more comfortably instead of running away and trying to find something different I just said \u2018f*** it, this is what I am, I can\u2019t really do anything else, it\u2019s a good problem so stop whining, you\u2019ve done this so long and people like it!\u2019 I put a lot into this record, I delved into it more than any other record and it was fun, probably the most relaxed I\u2019ve been on a record. I was trying to be more in the moment, more present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re drinking it isn\u2019t necessarily bad,\u201d Thompson adds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was all this unexpected stuff that happened, musically. To his credit, whether he was a drinker or now as a non-drinker, while that may have a lot of effect on your personal life, Joey has always been very good about showing up to do the work, whatever was going on in his life. Whatever was different or difficult or challenging or new was really about him and his relationship to alcohol, as opposed to completely changing the dynamic of the band. The dynamic of the band feels exactly the same, it\u2019s just better.\u201d\n\nAll four Pixies speak enthusiastically about the solid, family feel of the band in 2019 \u2013 of their relaxed and creative studio bond with each other and their new regular producer Tom Dalgety and of Lenchantin\u2019s invaluable contribution since she became the fully paid-up replacement for Kim Deal.\n\n\u201cBack of my head,\u201d Santiago says, \u201cI always wanna have a band out there that are \u2018branded\u2019 and have been around for so long \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even saying we\u2019ve been around for 30 years \u2013 for a band to come out, have a break-up and do records later on, I just hope we\u2019re one of those bands that makes that record and \u2018a comeback\u2019. They have such things going against them \u2013 the old fans, we lost an original, highly regarded member, to go against all the odds and make a great record. This is what it is and hopefully people will put aside their prejudices and give this a listen. It is good, but I hope people embrace it without this \u2018oh no, they\u2019re not gonna be the same\u2019... but with \u2018let\u2019s listen to it anyway\u2019.\u201d\n\nAre you in competition with your own legacy? \u201cOf course we are, but that\u2019s the gig,\u201d Thompson argues. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. We can\u2019t be considered a band with a legacy and also, as the band continues over the decades, not expect any \u2018hmm, well now I have to compete with my previous successes\u2019. It\u2019s like \u2018no! I want to have success then and I want to have success now, with no challenges whatsoever and no one questioning my station!\u2019 Doesn\u2019t that kinda take the fun out of it?\n\n\u201cI was trying to explain it to my daughter who did very well in a kung fu competition the other day. She was afraid she was going to lose because there was a lot of competition there. That\u2019s a normal enough feeling to have, but I did try to put it in a context to her and say \u2018look, if everyone at the kung fu competition just sucked and you were the star student and you were gonna hands-down win, no questions asked, because you were good and they were all terrible, that wouldn\u2019t be very much fun, probably. If it didn\u2019t have that sense of competition you probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in participating in it whatsoever\u2019.\n\n\u201cI guess I feel the same way in my own music, whether I\u2019m competing against other people or against myself or my past, all right, it is what it is, I\u2019m not complaining about it. There\u2019s gotta be some parameters, there\u2019s gotta be some challenges, otherwise I might as well stick VR glasses on my head and put a feeding tube into my arm. That\u2019s all part of being an artist, you can\u2019t constantly be afraid of failing. It\u2019s impressive those artists that never seem to fail, but some of my favourite artists, they fail.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the high bar of his own history that Thompson\u2019s up against, though. As a band that\u2019s pulled off one of rock\u2019s finest comebacks, both on record and at their ferocious fire-and-brimstone live shows, and stand alongside descendants such as Idles and Wolf Alice in the latest wave of guitar rock revivalism, it must be frustrating that streaming has turned the singles charts into a closed shop for alternative music?\n\nThompson is philosophical on the matter. \u201cEvery band and every musician has its challenge in order to exist in the world and to compete in the world of showbiz. Every generation of musicians has its own particular challenges. Now, if you\u2019re white and you\u2019re male and you\u2019re from the UK or America, I\u2019m just gonna call bulls*** on any of your challenges. What\u2019s this band that\u2019s getting a lot of publicity now from Beirut [Mashrou\u2019 Leila]? They\u2019ve got the gay singer, have death threats, get their gigs cancelled \u2013 that\u2019s a f***in\u2019 challenge, that\u2019s someone trying to shut you down, that\u2019s someone trying to stop you in a very heavy, violent kind of way. All right, you\u2019re not getting any radio exposure because of streaming or whatever, you\u2019re competing with the internet, you\u2019re competing with all these people that have short attention spans and smartphones, they\u2019re not putting you up on a f***in\u2019 pedestal like they were 30 years ago. Oh well, boo-hoo, welcome to showbiz.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 30 best album covers - ranked Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 30 best album covers - ranked 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album\u2019s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact. 3/30 28) David Bowie \u2013 Aladdin Sane It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned \u2013 Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead\u2019s house in Manchester. Jones didn\u2019t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead\u2019s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones\u2019s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. \u201cYeah, global dominance,\u201d he said. Soon after the album\u2019s release, that\u2019s exactly what happened. 7/30 24) Rolling Stones \u2013 Sticky Fingers Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger. 8/30 23) Miles Davis \u2013 Bitches Brew German painter Mati Klarwein \u2013 who also created Santana\u2019s artwork for Abraxas \u2013 was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis\u2019s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself; challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love. 9/30 22) AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black Back in Black\u2019s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, AC/DC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren\u2019t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history. 10/30 21) Blondie \u2013 Parallel Lines Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines\u2019 cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d her stance seems to say. \u201cTry harder.\u201d 11/30 20) Bob Dylan \u2013 The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: \u201cHe wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\u201d Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin\u2019 Time, also noted the cover\u2019s significance, how it \u201cinfluenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility\u201d. 12/30 19) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin couldn\u2019t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It\u2019s an easy tactic \u2013 using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music. 13/30 18) Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols. They\u2019d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word \u201cbollocks\u201d on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley \u2013 a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes. 24/30 7) The Beatles \u2013 Abbey Road Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it\u2019s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road\u2019s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision. 25/30 6) Grace Jones \u2013 Island Life Before he tried to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones\u2019s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose; it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history. 26/30 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico \u2013 The Velvet Underground and Nico Like the working zipper of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to \u201cPeel slowly and see\u201d, upon which they\u2019d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It\u2019s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover. 27/30 4) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures The cover art for Joy Division\u2019s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester\u2019s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 \u2013 from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. \u201cThe duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,\u201d Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. \u201cIts white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will. 28/30 3) Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind This is one of the most recognisable album covers of all time, and makes a fierce, mocking statement about the value western society places on chasing wealth \u2013 and the way it passes that message onto future generations. Record label Geffen were concerned by the appearance of three-month old Spencer Elden's penis on the cover, but Kurt Cobain would only accept a censor sticker over the image if it read: \u201cIf you're offended by this, you must be a closet paedophile.\u201d 29/30 2) The Beatles \u2013 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, \u201cyou also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for\u201d. 30/30 1) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder. \u201cThe only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,\u201d Smith told NPR in 2010. \u201cI got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, 'I got it'.\u201d 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album\u2019s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact. 3/30 28) David Bowie \u2013 Aladdin Sane It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned \u2013 Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead\u2019s house in Manchester. Jones didn\u2019t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead\u2019s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones\u2019s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. \u201cYeah, global dominance,\u201d he said. Soon after the album\u2019s release, that\u2019s exactly what happened. 7/30 24) Rolling Stones \u2013 Sticky Fingers Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger. 8/30 23) Miles Davis \u2013 Bitches Brew German painter Mati Klarwein \u2013 who also created Santana\u2019s artwork for Abraxas \u2013 was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis\u2019s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself; challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love. 9/30 22) AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black Back in Black\u2019s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, AC/DC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren\u2019t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history. 10/30 21) Blondie \u2013 Parallel Lines Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines\u2019 cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d her stance seems to say. \u201cTry harder.\u201d 11/30 20) Bob Dylan \u2013 The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: \u201cHe wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\u201d Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin\u2019 Time, also noted the cover\u2019s significance, how it \u201cinfluenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility\u201d. 12/30 19) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin couldn\u2019t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It\u2019s an easy tactic \u2013 using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music. 13/30 18) Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols. They\u2019d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word \u201cbollocks\u201d on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones w", "description": "Would I storm Area 51?\u201d Black Francis, aka Charles Thompson IV, ponders. \u201cOnly in terms of reading about it from the safety of a fine coffee shop. I\u2019m not going to storm anything, certainly not involving a military base\u2026\u201d", "authors": ["Mark Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/12/pixies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
