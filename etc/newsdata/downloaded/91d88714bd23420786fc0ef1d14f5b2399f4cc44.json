It\u2019s no longer about a popular movement, protests, health and employment demands, corruption,\u201d he said, questioning how protesters were funding their movement. Nasrallah called on his supporters not to engage demonstrators, after several were hurt in scuffles.\n\nAs his speech ended, groups of apparent Hezbollah supporters who had been arguing and fighting with protesters began to leave the main centers. However, in the southern suburbs of Beirut -- Hezbollah\u2019s stronghold -- and the city of Tyre, large numbers of people on motorbikes took to the streets in his support.\n\nHezbollah\u2019s show of strength and the appearance of party flags is a turning point in Lebanon\u2019s uprising, which had transcended for the first time the sectarian and party divisions that tend to dominate Lebanese politics.\n\nHezbollah, which has both political and military wings, performed well in the last elections and is part of the largest coalition in parliament and in the government. A Shi\u2019ite Muslim movement supported by Iran, it led for years the fight against Israel\u2019s occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended in 2000, and later fought a war against it in 2006. The group also dispatched fighters to neighboring Syria to defend President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran and its Lebanese proxy, during that country\u2019s eight-year-old civil conflict.\n\nSaudi Arabia Isn\u2019t Rushing to Bail Out Beirut Because of Iran\n\nNasrallah called on the so-far leaderless street movement to name its representatives and answer the president\u2019s invitation Thursday for a dialogue to end the crisis that has paralyzed the country. Main thoroughfares have been blocked by demonstrators and banks and schools have been shut since the revolt broke out last week over proposed tax increases.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun\u2019s first address to the nation since the protests was met with disappointment on the streets where many were calling for concrete measures.\n\nNasrallah urged the Lebanese public not to dismiss the government\u2019s zero-tax reform plan unveiled earlier this week to address key economic demands and avert a financial crisis. He has opposed calls for the government to resign and hold early elections, saying the economic situation was too fragile.\n\n\u201cA vacuum will lead to chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nLebanon Pledges Bank Tax as Part of Sweeping Drive to End Unrest\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Lin Noueihed in Beirut at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net;Dana Khraiche in Beirut at dkhraiche@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Followers of Lebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed Hezbollah took to the streets Friday, waving the armed movement\u2019s yellow flags and defending its leader against criticism after nine days of nationwide protests demanding the ouster of the political elite.In a televised speech, Hassan Nasrallah said", "authors": ["Lin Noueihed", "Dana Khraiche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
