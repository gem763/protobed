This day was amazing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Bound for Chile \u2013\n\nThunberg\u2019s stop in Colorado came amid a highly publicized journey from her hometown of Stockholm in which she traversed the Atlantic on a zero-emission sailboat before making an appearance at a United Nations climate summit.\n\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she thundered at world leaders gathered in New York, accusing them of handing younger generations a world of rising seas and increasingly severe weather.\n\nThat refrain \u2014 emphatically repeated by Thunberg in her UN speech \u2014 could be seen on several cardboard signs carried by crowd members in Denver.\n\n\u201cShe helped voice the opinions that I didn\u2019t know how to word. She said everything that I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d said Dante Lanthier, 16, one of many high school students who attended the event.\n\nStudents have been among the most receptive of audiences for Thunberg, who first rose to prominence in August 2018 when she started skipping school to sit outside the Swedish parliament with her \u201cSchool Strike for the Climate\u201d sign, to criticize government inaction on climate change.\n\nStudents across the world then began emulating her academic disobedience, leading to organized school walkouts and the rise of the \u201cFridays for Future\u201d movement, which organized the event in Denver.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you can\u2019t vote, you can\u2019t see the way to make changes,\u201d said Molly Ring, 18, a high schooler who recently participated in her first climate strike.\n\n\u201cHaving her\u2026 is really inspiring.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Fire and ice \u2013\n\nThunberg, who is heading by electric vehicle to Santiago, Chile in time for another UN climate conference in December, arrived in Denver on a day so cold that local media reported it broke a record set in 1946.\n\nHundreds of miles away, wildfires tore through southern California, forcing tens of thousands to evacuate.\n\nBoth are seen as symptomatic of the climate disaster Thunberg warns against.\n\n\u201cWith hotter summers, and earlier, colder winters, we need this message,\u201d 74-year-old Kate Hilsenbeck said of Thunberg\u2019s activism, as she waited for the young Swede to appear.\n\nThunberg has already won Amnesty International\u2019s top human rights prize and the Swedish Right Livelihood Award, often presented as an alternative Nobel.\n\nShe\u2019s also earned adoration from fans, some of whom shouted \u201cwe love you, Greta!\u201d as she left the venue following a speech that lasted just under 10 minutes.\n\nThat a Nobel Prize had eluded Thunberg this year seemed to worry her audience little.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s got lots of years to win all the prizes,\u201d said Denver resident Laurence Larrick, 67. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has to worry about that.\u201d", "description": "Denver (AFP) \u2013 Hours after judges passed her up for the Nobel Peace Prize, Greta Thunberg stood before a cheering throng, insisting once again that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/257331_swedish-environment-activist-greta-thunberg-speaks-fridaysforfuture-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
