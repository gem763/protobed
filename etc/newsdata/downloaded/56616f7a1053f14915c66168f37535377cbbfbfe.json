How would that affect business? Join the conversation below.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he would sign the bill, which is likely to upend the business model of companies that rely on \u201cgig workers,\u201d forcing them to reclassify many as full-time employees.\n\nUber and Lyft have spent much of the year pushing lawmakers to alter the bill or exempt them. That effort has failed against opposition from labor unions and a large Democratic majority in Sacramento.\n\nThe companies have argued the bill would introduce new costs and logistical challenges that would be bad for them and many of their employees, who prefer job flexibility. If the measure becomes law, it is expected to have national repercussions given California\u2019s economic importance and history of creating precedent-setting business regulations.\n\n\u201cWhat California does here is being watched by the rest of the nation,\u201d said Ken Jacobs, chair of the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhat happens here is likely to affect what other states do and\u2014depending on what happens in the upcoming elections\u2014what Congress does.\u201d\n\nWhile Uber and Lyft have been the bill\u2019s most active opponents, the measure also could force the reclassification of workers in other industries from trucking to janitorial services to music workers, according to Dr. Jacobs and business representatives.\n\nDemocratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez introduced the bill last December to codify a 2018 California Supreme Court decision that set new standards for classifying people previously considered independent contractors as employees. Activists and some lawmakers seized on the decision, which sprang from a case that began in 2005, as an opportunity to tackle fast-growing tech companies that relied on large pools of contractors.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has kind of looked the other way as this industry blew up, shame on us for not addressing this sooner,\u201d Ms. Gonzalez said.\n\nAs employees, ride-share drivers would be entitled to benefits such as a minimum hourly wage and workers compensation.\n\nBut the companies have argued the bill would take away much of the flexibility of drivers, who now work whenever they want and can earn more when demand jumps.\n\nLyft in particular has said that the bulk of its roughly 325,000 California drivers\u2014most of whom are part time\u2014would no longer be able to drive for the company if they were employees, because it would need to start scheduling shifts. \u201cThe vast majority of job opportunities would go away under an employment model,\u201d a Lyft spokesman said. \u201cCosts would also be higher on the passenger side.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which would take effect Jan. 1, has drawn the support of several Democratic presidential candidates, including U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe bill has been pushed by the state\u2019s most powerful unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the Teamsters. Uber and Lyft initially tried to engage with those organizations to carve out exemptions for themselves by offering things such as wage guarantees, funds for benefits and some ability to bargain with the companies.\n\nBut with the unions confident that the bill could pass in its original form, the talks fizzled over the summer, people with knowledge of the discussions said.\n\nSince then, the companies have gone directly to lawmakers in Sacramento, shuffling between legislators\u2019 offices and those of the governor over the past few weeks. Top executives making the case have included John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president, and Tony West, Uber\u2019s general counsel and the brother-in-law of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nLast month, Lyft and Uber made public their proposals to address labor\u2019s concerns without passing the law in its current form. Together with food delivery company DoorDash Inc., they also threatened that if the bill became law in its current form, they would spend $90 million on a ballot measure next year to try to exempt themselves.\n\nAides to Mr. Newsom helped facilitate talks between the companies, unions and lawmakers, but on Labor Day, four days after the ballot-measure threat, he announced for the first time that he would sign the bill if it passed.\n\nWith prospects dim for a last-minute deal, Uber and Lyft are also pushing lawmakers to consider new legislation in their next session, which begins in January. The companies are proposing a series of financial concessions and a way to give unions a way to represent drivers in negotiations even if the workers aren\u2019t classified as full-time employees.\n\n\u201cLabor leaders have a historic opportunity to dramatically improve the quality and security of independent work,\u201d an Uber spokesman said.\n\nSome gig-economy executives have also indicated they may challenge the bill in court if it becomes law.\n\nOn Monday, Uber and Lyft drivers in favor of the bill for ride-hailing companies filled the rotunda of the California capitol and chanted in support of the bill and a union.\n\n\u201cThey call us a partner, but I am anything but a partner,\u201d said Jeff Perry, who said he has driven for Uber in Sacramento for four years. \u201cEvery aspect of what I do other than signing in and out of the app is controlled by them.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com and Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com", "description": "The proposed bill would force ride-sharing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft to reclassify many drivers as full-time employees, likely upending their business model.", "authors": ["Alejandro Lazo", "Eliot Brown", "Alejandro.Lazo Wsj.Com", "Eliot.Brown Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105497/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
