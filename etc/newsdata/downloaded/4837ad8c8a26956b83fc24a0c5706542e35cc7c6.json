We've had BHS, we've had Carillion, we've had Patisserie Valerie and now we have Thomas Cook.\n\n'How many more do we need before your industry opens its eyes and recognises that you're complicit in all of this?'\n\nRival swoops in on holidaymakers On The Beach is spending more on advertising after Thomas Cook's collapse. In a trading update ahead of full-year results next month, the package holiday provider said its rival's downfall was an 'exciting' opportunity to win a bigger travel market share and that it has boosted its marketing budget. Although On The Beach is making hay now, it was initially stung by Thomas Cook's liquidation in late September as it had to rebook flights for around 225,000 people. Analysts have predicted this will cost On The Beach up to \u00a37million. Around one in five shorthaul beach holidays booked online are done through On The Beach.\n\nThe committee heard more details of the lucrative relationship PwC and EY had with Thomas Cook.\n\nPwC received around \u00a321million in consultancy and advisory fees between 2007 and 2016 on top of \u00a324.8million for auditing accounts.\n\nHemione Hudson, PwC's head of audit said it had backed the controversial decision to link bonuses to an underlying profit figure which stripped out 'exceptional items'.\n\nThese amounted to \u00a31.8billion over eight years and meant that despite severe financial problems, directors were awarded around \u00a320million in bonuses in five years.\n\nReeves said it created 'conflicts of interest' for an auditor to provide this type of advice. Hudson said PwC would stop doing extra work for big companies it audits.\n\nBut Reeves said this was only because PwC was 'implicated in the collapse of Carillion', as it had acted as the construction giant's pension consultant. Reeves said: 'The industry never is proactive, it always waits for legislation rather than doing the right thing.'\n\nEY said it generated around \u00a32.4million in 'non-audit' fees but stressed that this was for work auditors were required to carry out, such as vetting documents ahead of a bond issue at the end of 2017.", "description": "The extraordinary gravy train enjoyed by PwC and EY while they audited the doomed tour operator Thomas Cook's accounts was laid bare in the Commons yesterday.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
