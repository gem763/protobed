So far no injuries related to the latest wildfires have been reported.\n\nIn a separate spate of fires earlier this month at least one person was confirmed to have died following in the San Fernando valley.\n\nThe fires are also accompanied by intentional power cuts, causing further disruption to residents. The shutdowns are designed to prevent fierce winds from hurling branches into power lines or toppling them, sparking further wildfires.\n\nSupplier Southern California Edison, which cut power to more than 31,000 customers on Thursday, said it was considering additional outages likely to affect about 386,000 customers.\n\nDamaged power lines may have led to an outbreak of fire in Geyserville, with the state\u2019s largest power firm PG&E saying it was investigating after a 230,000-volt transmission line malfunctioned minutes before the blaze began.\n\nPG&E chief executive Bill Johnson said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment started the fire, while authorities are yet to confirm the cause of any of the outbreaks across the state.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nScientists create sticky fluid that can prevent wildfires", "description": "As many as 50,000 Californians have been told to evacuate their homes as wildfires spread across the state \u2013 with the latest blaze towering over Santa Clarita and the canyons north of Los Angeles.Spurred on by the dry 55mph gusts of the Santa Ana winds the flames have pushed through to LA-area neighbourhoods", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F7DSgupu5iLRrMYPYtN__A--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/63f2cd93c1a45eb3951bae88faa12c31", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
