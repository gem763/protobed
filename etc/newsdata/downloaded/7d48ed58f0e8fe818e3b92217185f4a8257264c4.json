He is being held in jail without bond on charges that include first-degree murder. It is not clear from court records whether he has retained an attorney.\n\nNoble has previous convictions for robbery, first-degree assault and probation violation, according to online court records. He has lived in Rockville and Frederick in recent years.\n\nJust after 6 p.m. Sunday, Montgomery patrol officers were called about an injured person near a hotel along Milestone Center Drive in Germantown. They found Efrain Arias, 31, stabbed. Arias died at the scene.\n\n\n\nKyle M. Noble (Montgomery County Police)\n\nAccording to court records, Arias had arrived in the hotel parking lot in a Mercedes driven by a woman. Arias got out and was approached by a man who reportedly chased him into a nearby field.\n\n\u201cThe victim was found shortly after by a witness, bleeding profusely,\u201d detectives wrote in the affidavit. \u201cThe suspect left the scene prior to police arrival.\u201d\n\nInvestigators used phone records to link Arias with the Mercedes driver, whom they asked to come to police headquarters to answer questions. The investigators did not name the woman in court records but identified her as \u201cWitness 1\u201d and described her as an ex-girlfriend of the suspect.\n\n\u201cWitness 1 stated on the day in question, her and the victim arrived on the parking lot\u201d of the hotel, \u201cand the victim exited her vehicle,\u201d detectives wrote. \u201cWitness 1 stated the suspect, her ex-boyfriend, then approached the vehicle and attempted to punch the victim in the face. The victim screamed and ran down toward the field with the suspect giving chase. The suspect returned shortly thereafter and Witness 1 observed blood on the suspect\u2019s face and body. The suspect approached Witness 1\u2019s vehicle and then told Witness 1 \u2018If you call the police, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 The suspect then left the scene and Witness 1 drove off.\u201d\n\nDetectives also alleged that the woman they had contacted arrived at the police headquarters in a Mercedes on which they found blood stains on the trunk\u2019s exterior.\n\nIn one of Noble\u2019s previous cases, he pleaded guilty in Frederick County to a first-degree assault in connection to a stabbing outside a liquor store, according to court records and the Frederick News Post. Another man also pleaded guilty in the case, and Noble\u2019s defense attorney told the News Post the victim could not identify who stabbed him.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Police in Maryland charged Kyle Martin Noble, 27, in a fatal stabbing outside a Germantown hotel.", "authors": ["Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ef7qExMGvsaFME0NoCdsuhKwjjc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63WVB7XYQAI6PGXXUUF4GMAAII.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
