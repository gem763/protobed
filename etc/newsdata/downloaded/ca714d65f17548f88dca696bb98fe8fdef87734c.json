But considered especially egregious were Trump\u2019s remarks about the number and route of the commando\u2019s helicopters.\n\n\u201cI always get a little bit nervous when people without knowledge of operations start describing operations,\u201d said Michael Nagata, a retired Army lieutenant general who was the senior special operations commander in the Middle East during the early stages of the anti-ISIS campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story, and I can understand the impulse to tell a good story. Telling it can have positive benefits. But the benefits are unpredictable and marginal, whereas the harm could be more substantial.\u201d\n\nTaken together, some of the details Trump revealed could help terrorist groups piece together new information about how U.S. counterterrorism forces gather intelligence and execute such dangerous missions, said veterans of previous operations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he went into that level of granularity,\u201d said a former senior military officer who has commanded troops in the region and like some others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
