But that\u2019s [the American flag] the one thing that kind of puts us together. That\u2019s what unites us.\"\n\nPaul said he collects \"out-of-service\" fire hoses and that they\u2019re also given to him by other departments. He recycles the old fire hoses by turning them into American flags and selling them.\n\n\u201cI used to make them a lot bigger. So each stripe was each piece of hose but now I kind of paint it to make them smaller and people like a smaller size,\u201d Paul said.\n\nFIREFIGHTER SAVES AMERICAN FLAG FROM VIETNAM VETERAN'S BURNING HOME\n\nCLEVELAND FIREFIGHTER ISSUED SAME BADGE AS FATHER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY\n\nPaul said that a fire hose typically lasts for several years and that it only takes a couple of hours to make the flag, which comes in a wooden frame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK that you have a difference of opinion from me or from you, but when it comes to the flag, that\u2019s what brings us together,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPaul, who served as a first responder in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, started his craft in 2015, making one as a decoration for his firehouse. Then it became popular, being displayed all over the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe\u2019s made more than 100 flags so far--one is displayed at a local restaurant.", "description": "A Florida firefighter who has put a patriotic spin on discarded fire hoses told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d\u00a0Monday that he makes the flags because he \u201cloves his country.\u201d", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-11.50.21-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
