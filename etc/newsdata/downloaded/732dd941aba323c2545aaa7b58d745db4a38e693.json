Another man, 49, was shot in the right arm. Another person received a minor injury in the leg as they tried to flee the scene.\n\nWorried locals were seen waiting nearby and loved ones were pictured sobbing after receiving news of who was inside.\n\nPolice received reports of gunshots fired around 6.55am and firefighters initially responded to the scene at 7.06am.\n\nCops recovered a 9mm handgun and revolver at the scene.
