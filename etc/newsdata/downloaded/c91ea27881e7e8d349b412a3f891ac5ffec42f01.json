Within \u201cseconds,\u201d the 12-year-old said, she was pushed down, her hands held behind her back as the boys called her names and cut off patches of her \u201cugly, nappy\u201d dreadlocks.\n\n\u201cOne of the boys put his hand over my mouth so I wouldn\u2019t scream while they used scissors on my hair,\u201d she recalled to The Daily Beast on Thursday. \"They were all laughing, calling me ugly, and saying I should have never been born.\u201d\n\nThe alleged assault only lasted \u201ca minute or two\u201d before the bell rang to signal the end of recess, the sixth grader said. The three boys took off running to go into their math class while Amari stayed on the slide, trying to collect herself before following behind.\n\n\u201cThey ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there,\u201d the soft-spoken teenager said. \u201cI\u2019m hurt that it happened. All I want to ask them is, Why?\u201d\n\nThe Monday afternoon racist attack at the private Immanuel Christian School\u2014an already controversial school where Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, teaches art class part-time\u2014has \u201cdestroyed\u201d the Allen family, and they are now seeking legal and administrative retributions.\n\nCourtesy of Cynthia Allen More\n\nAmari\u2019s mother, Cynthia Allen, told The Daily Beast that the family met with school officials on Thursday morning to demand the three boys be removed and updated policies be put into place to ensure \u201cthis doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Allen also said Amari filed a police report.\n\n\u201cWe take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse. We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can,\u201d the school said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I am asking for is this to be resolved, if they can\u2019t leave school, then I will,\u201d Amari said. Her mother agreed, adding, \u201cShe\u2019s in real pain but she wants justice.\u201d\n\nThe 53-year-old mom said it took two days for Amari to finally admit the attack even happened. At first, the 12-year-old told her mother that the missing parts of her hair were the result of playing \u201cbeauty salon\u201d with another friend.\n\n\u201cWe continued to press her on it because it just didn\u2019t sound like something she would do,\u201d Cynthia Allen said. \u201cThen she started breaking down crying, trembling, and shaking before telling us what happened.\u201d\n\nAmari said she \u201cinstantly felt better\u201d when she told her family about how the three sixth-grade boys pinned her down on the playground. She said while one boy covered her mouth, a second boy put her hands behind her back, and a third boy cut her dreadlocks while calling her names.\n\n\u201cThey called her \u2018ugly,\u2019 told her she was an \u2018attention seeker,\u2019 called her hair \u2018nappy,\u2019 all of these horrible things,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAnd when they ran away laughing, she just had to sit there and get herself together.\u201d\n\nAmari admitted she initially denied that anyone cut her hair out of fear of retaliation. The three boys\u2014including one that used to be her friend\u2014are in six of her classes and she said she was afraid they \u201cwould come after me.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Courtesy Cynthia AllenAmari Allen was about to use the slide at the Immanuel Christian School playground on Monday when three white classmates appeared.
