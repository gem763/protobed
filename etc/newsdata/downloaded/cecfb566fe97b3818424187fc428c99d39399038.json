For Renee Zellweger, getting under her skin was like falling in love.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Cast member Renee Zellweger attends the premiere for the film \"Judy\" in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nZellweger, 50, has won rave reviews for her heartbreaking portrait of Garland in \u201cJudy,\u201d out in U.S. movie theaters on Friday, and awards pundits are already predicting a fourth Oscar nomination.\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d focuses on the period when Garland struggled with alcohol, prescription drug use and her broken finances on a trip to London in late 1968 for a series of concerts. The \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d star died at age 47 of an accidental drug overdose in June 1969.\n\nZellweger took voice lessons for a year before filming started and worked with a choreographer to capture Garland\u2019s mannerisms in the final year of her life.\n\n\u201cI put the music on and then I started digging for the books and I ordered the books and then I dug around on the Internet every day and I just took in very greedily everything I could find. I was just in love and I got more and more greedy,\u201d Zellweger told Reuters Television.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be away from it,\u201d she added.\n\nZellweger\u2019s transformation from the blond actress who played British singleton \u201cBridget Jones,\u201d sang in movie musical \u201cChicago\u201d and won a supporting actress Oscar for drama \u201cCold Mountain\u201d has been called a career best performance by critics.\n\nWhile the actress \u201chardly seems like a natural doppelganger for Garland, she subsumes herself completely in the role, without ever tipping over into some kind of gestural Judy drag,\u201d wrote Entertainment Weekly.\n\nZellweger\u2019s co-stars were also amazed.\n\n\u201cShe was rarely not Judy. She had so much to do. She was often working before I got there and she was still working after I left. I rarely saw her outside of the character and so I kind of forgot who Renee was,\u201d said Finn Wittrock, who plays Garland\u2019s fifth and last husband Mickey Deans.\n\nWhile Garland\u2019s children - Liza Minnelli, Lorna Luft and Joey Luft - were not involved in the making of the film, Zellweger hopes they will see that \u201cour intention to celebrate her is evident.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you understand what it is that she was able to overcome in order to continue to deliver and continue to perform for her audiences, and connect with people and move them in the way that she did, is to then really understand how extraordinary she was,\u201d she said.", "description": "How do you play a Hollywood icon like Judy Garland?
