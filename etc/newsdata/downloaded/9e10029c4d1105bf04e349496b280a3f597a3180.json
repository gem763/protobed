Ingvar Kamprad, then 17 years old, was Member No. 4,014 of Swedish Socialist Unity, the country\u2019s leading far-right party during the war. Sweden\u2019s general security service had apparently kept him under surveillance for at least eight months, confiscating and reading his correspondence.\u201d\n\nThe author notes that \u201cno one so far has managed\u201d to determine when Kamprad left the Swedish Nazi Party, noting that his involvement with the fascist and anti-Semitic movements in his country continued after World War II. \u201cHe invited comrades from the movement to his home in Elmtaryd and was regarded as their benefactor,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere are letters where he is asked to donate or thanked for the latest contribution. Kamprad also acted as publisher for one of the fascist leader Per Engdahl\u2019s books. The two had become close friends and called each other \u2018BB\u2019: best brother. Engdahl was invited to Kamprad\u2019s first wedding in 1951, a quiet affair in a church outside Stockholm, at which he gave a beautiful speech.\u201d\n\nWhen \u00c5sbrink published a book in 2011 with her findings about Kamprad\u2019s Nazi ties, it took IKEA a month to respond, but the company ultimately made a $51 million donation to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, the single-largest donation in the history of the organization. But, as she notes in her book, Swedish citizens still haven\u2019t been able to reconcile what IKEA means for their country and who Ingvar Kamprad actually was.\n\n\u201cHow could he remain loyal to the fascist leader and Holocaust denier Per Engdahl, belong to a Nazi party and, at the same time, be so fond of his Jewish friend, Otto Ullman? Otto, whose parents were murdered in Auschwitz?\u201d she writes. \u201cWhen I repeatedly asked Mr. Kamprad for an answer in my interview with him in 2010, I finally received a shocking reply: \u2018There\u2019s no contradiction as far as I\u2019m concerned. Per Engdahl was a great man, and I\u2019ll maintain that as long as I live.'\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Lithub", "description": "In her new book, Swedish journalist Elisabeth \u00c5sbrink recalls her 2010 interview with IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad about his far-right ties.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-911383438.jpg?fit=1024%2C687", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
