I don't know what restrictions they will have internally,\" Esper said.\n\n\"The White House has a say on the release of documents as well. There are a number of things that play into this.\"\n\nDemocrats obtained a string of text messages between US diplomats that showed the Trump administration's effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son Hunter, and that some diplomats in the text chain expressed concern that such actions were inappropriate.\n\n- 'Absolutely illegal' -\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent senior Democrats an eight-page letter declaring the inquiry illegitimate. The letter has been rejected by experts as having little legal basis.\n\nThe Democrats' subpoenas focus in part is on Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA released rough transcript of the call shows the two leaders discussed Zelensky's desire to receive the military aid, followed by Trump responding that \"I would like you to do us a favor though,\" and then bringing up Biden.\n\nEsper was asked by Fox News if Trump had explained why he held up the aid, against the guidance of the Pentagon, and replied: \"I have nothing to share with you on this.\"\n\nDetails of the call emerged last month in an explosive whistleblower complaint by an unidentified intelligence official.\n\nThe scandal is unusual in that the conduct in question -- Trump soliciting an investigation of a potential 2020 election rival from a foreign country -- is acknowledged by both sides.\n\nAt dispute is whether the phone call constituted a crime or an impeachable offense.\n\nFederal Election Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub has declined to discuss the specifics of Trump's case.\n\nBut she told MSNBC earlier this month that \"the law is pretty clear... It is absolutely illegal for anyone to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with any election in the United States.\"\n\nSunday's morning talk shows, in a repeat of last week, were notable for the absence of key administration officials willing to publicly defend Trump's actions.\n\nFormer Ohio governor John Kasich told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that his fellow Republicans needed to \"look in the mirror\" and speak out on the Ukraine call.\n\n\"Figure out how you want to be remembered later... There's nothing wrong with telling the truth and sharing your real feelings,\" he said.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, the evidence is there to impeach Trump,\" Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, told ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nBut he added that the \"real issue\" is whether top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell will \"do the right thing\" if Trump is impeached, setting the stage for a trial in the US legislature's upper house.\n\n\"I am nervous that McConnell will put party in front of country,\" Sanders said.", "description": "US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday the Pentagon would cooperate with the congressional impeachment inquiry -- in an apparent break with President Donald Trump's policy to thwart the probe.
