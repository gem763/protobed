(Heidi Eisenhuth)\n\nDavid Tindall, a sociology professor at the University of British Columbia who studies social movements, said protests like this \u201ccould backfire a little bit\u201d in the short term because they annoy people instead of winning them over.\n\nIn Edmonton, some drivers took to yelling at the protesters on Monday when they were blocked from using the Walterdale Bridge.\n\n\"I think there are definitely channels that would be more suited to doing this and not interrupting people's lives,\" said Jack Haworth, who\u2019d been waiting in his car for an hour to get through.\n\nBut Harmony said she thinks it\u2019s worth disrupting lives in order to get the message across.\n\n\u201cThe good outweighs the harm,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother possible drawback to the Extinction Rebellion message? It\u2019s very gloomy, Tindall said.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, when things are framed that way, it kind of leads to inaction,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to give people some good news\u201d so they don\u2019t give up.\n\nBut Harmony doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\nExtinction is a \u201cpretty strong word, but I think it best fits with what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that the word \u201crebellion\u201d is in the name, too, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the rebellion of extinction, so I think there\u2019s positivity in that.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, Tindall said, having protesters \u201cdoing disruptive stuff\u201d can help in the push for change because it forces political leaders to pay attention to what the more moderate protesters are saying.\n\n\u201cThese more radical groups sometimes put the pressure on governments to take more action than they otherwise would,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, doing disruptive stuff can have consequences \u2014 such as getting arrested.\n\nExtinction Rebellion relies on a protest style called \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d to get its point across.\n\nThat means group members are willing to break some laws in the name of their cause and accept the consequences \u2014 as long as their actions aren\u2019t violent.\n\nHarmony said she has chosen not to engage in any civil disobedience in her role with Extinction Rebellion because \u201cI think my mom would have my head,\u201d she said.\n\nHarmony said she tries to participate in other ways, including doing speeches and working behind the scenes.\n\nWith files from CBC News", "description": "A look at the pros and cons of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s #BridgeOut protest including the perspective of a 17-year-old protester in Victoria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/ERThumb2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
