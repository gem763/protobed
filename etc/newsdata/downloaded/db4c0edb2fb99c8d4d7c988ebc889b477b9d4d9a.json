Down a set and a break and twice a point away from falling a double break behind, Murray rallied in the most dramatic fashion and beat a fellow three-time Grand Slam champion 3-6 6-4 6-4.\n\nThis is Murray\u2019s first ATP Tour singles title since winning at Dubai in March 2017.\n\nStan Wawrinka was in good form (Picture: AP)\n\nAt the start of the year, Murray was in sheer agony even when attempting menial tasks such as putting his socks on but he is now pain free and thriving. Hope for the future is bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is now no need to question whether he can resurrect his career. It\u2019s alive. How high he can climb in 2020 will be a source of wonder for sports fans around the globe.\n\nThis title may not be as prestigious a win as a Grand Slam but this will surely rank among the most special victories in Murray\u2019s illustrious career. From where he was at the start of the season, it\u2019s scarcely believable.\n\nFor much of this battle in Antwerp, Wawrinka was the superior player.\n\nHis weaponry was firing on all cylinders, with Murray just keeping himself within touching distance in the hope that his level dipped.\n\nMurray was pushed hard by Wawrinka (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe moment it did, Murray pounced. First to recover from a break down in the second set before pinching it, then on two separate occasions in a tense decider.\n\n\u2018It means a lot. Last few years have been extremely difficult,\u2019 an emotional Murray said after the match.\n\n\u2018Both me and Stan have had a lot of injury problems in the last couple of years.\n\nMurray was clearly emotional after the match (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing to be back, playing against him in the final like that. I think it was a great match.\n\n\u2018Stan was playing unbelievable. I just managed to hang in a bit at the end of the second set and the third set was extremely close again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to be in this position at all. I\u2019m happy, very happy.\u2019\n\nMORE: Roger Federer will play French Open as well as Olympics as Andy Murray casts doubts over doubles in Tokyo", "description": "Nine months after being retired on court by his peers, nine months after hip surgery, Andy Murray is once again an ATP champion after defeating Stan Wawrinka to win the...", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177191359_1571590692.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
