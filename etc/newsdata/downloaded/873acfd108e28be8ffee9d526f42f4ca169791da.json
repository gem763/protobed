The way in which Van Dijk quickly stamped his mark on the Liverpool team did little to suggest otherwise.\n\nMourinho made Jerome Boateng his preferred target, but a move never materalised and the manager was given the boot last December after a heavy defeat against Liverpool.\n\nUnited's manhunt for an ideal alternative began in earnest this summer after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer concurred with Mourinho they were a defender light.\n\nThere was no one of the ilk of Van Dijk available, leaving United with few options but to succumb to Leicester's world-record \u00a380m demands to sign Maguire.\n\nThe England defender had long been on the radar and there was a sense among high-ranking officials at the club that they had finally atoned for that mistake a year-and-a-half ago - albeit having to pay through the teeth to do it.\n\nBut as Maguire and Van Dijk - the world's most expensive defenders - prepare to go head-to-head at Old Trafford on Sunday, the overwhelming feeling now will still be that they signed the wrong man.\n\nGary Neville admitted he hoped Maguire would have an immediate impact similar to what Van Dijk had at Liverpool.\n\nHe said back in August: 'The hope here in Manchester is that Harry Maguire doesn't just do his job but he is a catalyst for strengthening the whole team.\n\n'It's wrong to sit here and say that Harry Maguire is going to make that Van Dijk type of difference but what I would say is there's a chance, because he's got that quality.'\n\nMaguire has somewhat shored up United's defence this season - although performances have been far from spectacular - but as for emulating the Van Dijk effect? A resounding no so far.\n\nAt this stage last season, United had conceded 14 goals in comparison to the eight they have let in this term.\n\nOnly Liverpool, Sheffield United and Leicester have conceded fewer. So, there has been some improvements defensively despite Solskjaer's men managing just two wins from eight league games.\n\nMaguire has been a rare constant in a forever chop-and-changing United team, but while he has brought some stability to their defence, performances on the whole have declined and results have worsened.\n\nStatistically, Maguire is not performing as well as he was last season at Leicester either.\n\nHis aerial success is down by five per cent, while his tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes is also currently lower than last season - but he is being dribbled past less and his passing accuracy has increased.\n\nLiverpool signed Van Dijk in January 2018 and has gone on to be the best defender in the world\n\nIt only needs a quick glance at Van Dijk's numbers this season though to see that Maguire's are stark in comparison.\n\nThe Liverpool defender has registered more tackles, interceptions, blocks and clearances, and has a significantly better aerial success rate than Maguire.\n\nEven comparing their Premier League career stats, it is Van Dijk who comes out on top - the Dutchman wins more aerial battles, duels, is harder to take on and has a better passing accuracy.\n\nCredit for Liverpool's transformation from unlucky also-rans to Champions League winners can not all go to Van Dijk.\n\nBut the way in which he has organised their defence, improved other players around him - namely Joel Matip, who has benefited immensely from Van Dijk's calm presence at the back - cannot be understated.\n\nMaguire became the world's most expensive defender in the summer after signing for United\n\nHe is the focal point of this brilliant Liverpool team and his superb consistency last season was recognised in the form of the PFA Player of the Year and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards.\n\nMaguire has not been a United player for long. He has only played eight times for the club, and it's bound to take some time before he starts showing his best form.\n\nNo one is saying that United's dismal start is down to him, but fans would have hoped an \u00a380m defender, who is often described as the leader-of-men type, would have been able to galvanise the squad.\n\nBut so far, no dice. Maguire is still United's best centre back at present, but in hindsight, had they been given their chance again, you wonder who United would have rather signed.", "description": "THE NUMBERS GAME - JORDAN SEWARD: Manchester United would have felt as though a wrong was righted when they signed Harry Maguire this summer.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19887900-0-image-a-4_1571409154271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
