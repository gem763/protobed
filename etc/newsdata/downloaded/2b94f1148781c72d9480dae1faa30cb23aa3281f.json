They consulted with various experts like doctors, astronaut trainers, pilots, shoe designers, engineers, and future astronauts.\n\n\u201cVirgin Galactic gave us an exciting challenge to build the world\u2019s first commercial spacesuit,\u201d Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank said. \u201cInnovation is at the core of everything we do and our team delivered a unique twist on the classic spacesuit utilizing both existing and new UA technologies to define space gear for the future.\u201d\n\nThe spacewear has been tested in labs and will be used by Virgin Galactic test crews ahead of its commercial flights, which could start in 2020, according to the company.\n\nSpacesuits will be tailored for each astronaut and personalized with flags and name badges, as well as a transparent pocket for photos of loved ones.\n\n\u201cI love the way the spacewear looks and I love the way it feels,\u201d Branson said. \u201cI also love the fact that the next time I put it on, I will be on my way to space.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nVirgin Galactic is preparing to take passengers on flights to the edge of space aboard a spacecraft it calls SpaceShipTwo.
