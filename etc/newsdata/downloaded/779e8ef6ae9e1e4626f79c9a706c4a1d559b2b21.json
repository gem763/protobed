Sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Delisle was jailed for 20 years in 2013 but released on parole in 2018.\n\nCanadian officials told a sentencing hearing in 2013 that allies had threatened to withhold intelligence from Canada unless it tightened security procedures.\n\nLucki said Ortis - who joined the RCMP in 2007 - had been director general of the RCMP's National Intelligence Coordination Center, with broad access to information.\n\nThe RCMP did not say to whom the information was leaked.\n\nOrtis has a doctorate in international relations from the University of British Columbia in western Canada, where he worked with Professor Paul Evans.\n\n\"Nothing in my experience with Cameron would lead me to suspect he would be any way involved in activities that would lead to such charges,\" Evans said in an email to Reuters.\n\n\"Like others who know him well, I was shocked by the news of the arrest of a very fine Canadian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa,; Editing by Dan Grebler and Matthew Lewis)", "description": "The arrest of a top Canadian police officer on charges of leaking secret information could hurt intelligence operations by allied nations, the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Monday.
