We\u2019re investing in our product and service,\u201d says Mr Griffiths.\n\nDubai Airports has another, much newer airport, in the desert about 30 miles away.\n\nDubai World Central (DWC) is already in use by a small number of airlines. It was originally planned to take over from DXB as the main hub for Emirates, which is the dominant airline.\n\nBut Mr Griffiths says the current throughput at the original airport could increase by one third, with no additional runways beyond the existing two.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to try and increase the capacity potential beyond the current 90 million that we\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cWith the right investment in the right projects we could get this airport to about 120 million. That gives us another 10 to 15 years growth.\u201d\n\nThe airport is currently very busy during the three daily banks of flights. Three times a day, hundreds of aircraft fly in, unload and reload, with passengers connecting between the UK and Australia or between India and the US.\n\nTo accommodate more passengers, the airport and Emirates are working to \u201cde-peak\u201d the schedules \u2013 spreading arrivals and departures more evenly across the day.\n\nAn additional challenge to growth is that Emirates is already planning to stop flying the Airbus A380.\n\nThe Dubai-based airline is the world\u2019s biggest operator of the superjumbo, but is progressively switching to smaller planes including the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X.\n\nBut the boss of Dubai Airports says the reduction in average plane size will be more than made up by increasing frequency.\n\n\u201cInstead of having maybe two A380s that are you could end up on four different choices of departure by during the course of the day.\n\n\u201cWe know that that gives greater connecting opportunities and perhaps faster journey times.\u201d\n\nWhile DXB is expanding, development at DWC will pause while traveller behaviour and airline preferences are assessed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last decade a massive leap forward. There was interim technology and everyone was going to have self-service check-in machines.\n\n\u201cBut now what\u2019s happening is people saying we don\u2019t want the machines at all, let\u2019s come completely rethink the entire check-in process.\n\n\u201cSo about a year ago we came up with a strategy to say if we were Google or we were Uber, how would we re-imagine the entire airport experience?\n\n\u201cThen do we build DWC phase 2, which clearly we\u2019ve got to because we are geographically limited here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll end up with a genuine airport fit for the 22nd century that will have state-of-the-art facilities.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring back the romance of travel and make the whole experience more personalised \u2013 which I think the aim of putting in the right technology will actually help us achieve.\u201d\n\nDubai International will celebrate its 60th birthday next year.
