It draws support mainly from urban voters upset by the PiS\u2019s divisive politics, controversial judicial reforms and graft scandals.\n\nThe PiS lost control of the senate, or upper house, taking 48 of the 100 seats, something analysts said would provide a check on the party\u2019s legislative drives.\n\n\u2013 Presidential election \u2013\n\nThe PiS is expected to continue welfare spending, including a popular new child allowance along with pension hikes as it eyes the May 2020 presidential election, according to Warsaw University political analyst Stanislaw Mocek.\n\n\u201cThey will leave the most controversial reforms (judicial, media) for after the presidential election,\u201d he said, referring to court reforms that risk undermining judicial independence and the rule of law, something likely to further antagonise Brussels.\n\nCondemning the PiS\u2019s anti-LGBT drive and close church ties, but sharing its welfare goals, the left returned to parliament after a four-year hiatus with 12.56 percent of the vote and 49 seats.\n\nConfederation, a new far-right libertarian coalition known for its anti-EU views, also made it over the five percent threshold to enter parliament with 6.81 percent for 11 seats.\n\nThe PSL farmers/Kukiz 15 alliance took 8.55 percent of the vote for 27 seats.\n\n\u2013 Welfare state \u2013\n\nIn office since 2015, Kaczynski\u2019s PiS has focussed on poorer rural voters, coupling family values with the introduction of welfare state spending, tax breaks for low-income earners and hikes to pensions and the minimum wage.\n\nKaczynski has tapped into a populist backlash against liberal elites, similar to trends in Western Europe and the US.\n\nHis party\u2019s bid to build a welfare state appeals to Poles who felt left behind amid the explosive growth and unfettered free-market drive after communism fell in 1989.\n\n\u201cUnder the PiS government I retired earlier, at 60, I received an extra 13th pension payment,\u201d a 62-year-old Warsaw pensioner who only identified herself as Magdalena, told AFP on Monday, hailing the populist victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation for pensioners will evolve, perhaps medicine will become cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sovereignty vs. federalism \u2013\n\nKaczynski has also stoked deep social division by attacking sexual minorities and rejecting Western liberal values, all with the tacit blessing of Poland\u2019s influential Catholic Church which holds sway over rural voters.\n\nHe is among several populist leaders in the European Union seeking greater national sovereignty over the federalism championed by France and Germany.\n\nThe PiS has also sought favour with the Trump administration in a bid to reinforce Poland\u2019s security withing the NATO alliance and as a bulwark against Russia, its Soviet-era master with whom tensions still run high.\n\nCritics attribute strong economic growth under the PiS to favourable external factors.\n\nA tight labour market in the EU country of 38 million people saw it become the world\u2019s top temporary migrant labour destination in 2017, according to the OECD.\n\nTurnout for Sunday\u2019s election tallied at 61.74 percent, the highest since Poland shed communism in 1989.", "description": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Poland\u2019s governing right-wing populist party won a weekend election, full official results showed on Monday, retaining a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/20ad23_pis-party-leader-jaroslaw-kaczynski-we-obtained-mandate-continue-our-good-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
