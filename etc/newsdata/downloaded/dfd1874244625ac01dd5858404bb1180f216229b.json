REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank left policy unchanged as expected on Thursday but kept the door open to even more stimulus as the euro zone economy continues to suffer from the fallout of broader global turmoil.\n\nWith economic growth barely holding in positive territory and inflation at less than half of its target, the ECB unleashed a massive stimulus package last month, cutting rates deeper into negative territory and relaunching a recently shuttered bond purchase scheme.\n\nIn Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting as ECB boss, policymakers are likely to reaffirm this package, arguing that a dismal string of data since September justified the stimulus, despite noisy opposition from policy hawks.\n\nWith Christine Lagarde coming in to lead the bank from Nov. 1, policy is likely to be on auto-pilot for months to come, giving the bank\u2019s new boss time and space to launch a promised review of the ECB\u2019s policy framework.\n\n\u201cThe Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAttention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s final news conference at 1230 GMT, where he is likely to emphasise downside risks to the economy.\n\nWith Thursday\u2019s decision, the ECB\u2019s rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at a record low of -0.50%.\n\nThe main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00% while the rate on the marginal lending facility \u2014 the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks \u2014 remains at 0.25%.\n\nStarting next month, the ECB will also start purchasing bonds, mostly government debt, at a rate of 20 billion euros a month.", "description": "The European Central Bank left policy unchanged as expected on Thursday but kept the door open to even more stimulus as the euro zone economy continues to suffer from the fallout of broader global turmoil.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444484968&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N101", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
