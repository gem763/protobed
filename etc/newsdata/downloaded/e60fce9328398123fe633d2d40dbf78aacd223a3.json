I've never met Maya. I've never met her in my life. I swear to God, I've never met her in my life.\"\n\nThe heartthrob, who won the affection of Love Island fans for his chilled attitude and humour, added: \"They did filming for the very last [Love Island] Aftersun, which was at the villa, where she was there with two other talents and the whole cast we'd sort of shot - I think it was like a promo.\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for ASO)\n\n\"You know, she was standing outside a door but, no, never met her in my life.\"\n\nA representative for Maya, who recently split from grime star Stormzy, denied the allegations as well.\n\n\"They've never met so there's no truth to this,\" they said.\n\nOvie's still dating India Reynolds, who he met in the villa.

Obviously, I love fashion, I do love TV, I love the whole entertainment world, I find it pretty cool.\n\n\"I would say everything I do now is just things that I've thought through and they're just true to me.\"", "description": "Ovie was on JD Sports' podcast when he dismissed rumours of a romance between him and Maya, saying that he's never even met her", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Dave Benett Getty Images For Aso", "Colin Hawkins Photography Lovehoney", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20080803.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_ASOS-Presents-National-Ovie-Day.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
