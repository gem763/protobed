But not as we know it: Celebrity version launches this month", "language": "en", "text": "Every judge on a TV talent show is looking for that Susan Boyle moment, the one where the performance on stage is so unexpected that jaws drop to the floor.\n\nNicole Scherzinger seems to have experienced it with the new series of The X Factor, which is a celebrity version rather than a parade of complete unknowns.\n\nThe contestants who captured her attention are rugby players Thom Evans, Ben Foden and Levi Davis, who teamed up in the auditions to form a boy band.\n\nOiled chests were de rigueur, by all accounts, and it sounds like Nicole gave them full marks. \u2018I love the rugby boys,\u2019 she admits during a break in filming today.\n\n\u2018I love them! Who doesn\u2019t love a bit of rugby boys having a stab at this singing thing? It was like a Magic Mike routine. It got everyone\u2019s attention!\u2019\n\nNicole reunites with Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh (pictured) for The X Factor Celebrity\n\nNicole, pictured, revealed the contestants who captured her attention are rugby players Thom Evans, Ben Foden and Levi Davis, who teamed up in the auditions to form a boy band\n\nOther acts have left her swooning too.\n\nThe celebrity inclusion that surprised her most was none other than journalist Martin Bashir.\n\nThe man who scooped that TV interview with Princess Diana has gone on to establish himself as one of TV\u2019s heavyweight news operators, yet he put himself forward for The X Factor.\n\nHas the world gone mad? Does he get his torso out too?\n\nAlas, all Nicole will confirm is that she was shellshocked to even see him there.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s the kind of person people are not used to seeing in this light, and the way he spoke about why he did it, his voice, and his performance... well, he was the biggest surprise to me, for sure.\u2019\n\nThe idea of a special celeb series was Simon Cowell\u2019s brainchild.\n\nHe wanted a tweak to the format that would get everyone talking, and tuning in.\n\nEver wondered what Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Brendan Cole and Jeremy Edwards (pictured) from Hollyoaks would sound like together? No, us neither, but they\u2019re doing a duet\n\nThe full line-up is eyebrow-raising and includes actors, soap stars and social media influencers. Chat show host Rikki Lake is in there, as is David Hasselhoff\u2019s daughter Hayley and TOWIE\u2019s Megan McKenna.\n\nActor Kevin McHale is stepping up to the mic (he\u2019s been in Glee, so his singing credentials are a given), so too is Jenny Ryan, better known as one of the Chasers on The Chase. (Can she sing? She certainly can.)\n\nSome acts offer up a celeb double-hit. Ever wondered what Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Brendan Cole and Jeremy Edwards from Hollyoaks would sound like together?\n\nNo, us neither, but they\u2019re doing a duet.\n\nThe contestants are stars in their own field, so their careers aren\u2019t depending on it. 'It will be a fun season. But there is proper singing talent there. A couple of people blew me away\n\nThere\u2019s a band made up of Love Island stars \u2013 contestants Nicole puts in that bracket of \u2018the ones you wouldn\u2019t expect to be great, but are\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s the groups \u2013 surely the ultimate in manufactured pop \u2013 that are interesting, she says.\n\n\u2018Audiences will know them individually then as a group, so there\u2019s a connection there already.\n\n'But there\u2019s an advantage and a disadvantage, because maybe some of the people aren\u2019t as strong; that might hurt the group.\u2019\n\nSimon knows only too well how putting individual stars together, with a song sheet, can surprise. His big breakthrough was when he, then a lowly record company exec, convinced two actors to team up and bring out a record.\n\nThe result was Robson & Jerome \u2013 who shifted more records than the established pop stars of the day. Can this be recreated? Well, he hopes so \u2013 the prize this year is a recording contract.\n\nThe celebrity inclusion that surprised Nicole most was none other than journalist Martin Bashir, pictured. The man who scooped that TV interview with Princess Diana has gone on to establish himself as one of TV\u2019s heavyweight news operators, yet he put himself forward\n\nIt\u2019s all quite mad, but when we catch up with Nicole to find out how the early stages of filming have been going, it sounds like the judges are having a blast.\n\nThis year sees her return to the panel, along with Simon and another old hand, Louis Walsh. \u2018Simon trusts us and knows what he\u2019ll get with us,\u2019 she explains.\n\nShe says it\u2019s more relaxed because the judges aren\u2019t sitting there knowing someone\u2019s entire career depends on their call.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a little less pressure. They\u2019re stars in their own field, so their careers aren\u2019t depending on it.\n\nI sleep well on a plane, it\u2019s a blessing. My team think I\u2019m crazy, but I\u2019m trying to embrace the madness\n\n'It will be a fun season. But there is proper singing talent there. A couple of people blew me away.\u2019\n\nWhat a gig to get.\n\nThe early auditions were filmed at Simon Cowell\u2019s new \u00a320 million home in Malibu, which is more of a compound than a holiday cottage.\n\nOverlooking the Pacific Ocean, the house has seven bedrooms, staff quarters and a guest suite. Filming took place in the back garden, where there\u2019s a swimming pool, a spa and a koi carp pool.\n\nSo has Nicole been lounging about, cocktail in hand? Definitely not.\n\nShe sounds more exhausted than anyone in this setting should. It turns out she\u2019s been juggling filming this show with jobs as a judge on Australia\u2019s Got Talent and also the US talent show The Masked Singer, in which celebrities compete in full costume and face masks.\n\nAt peak madness, she was flying between LA and Sydney every single day.\n\nNicole's Instagram is full of pictures of her in Lycra (pictured), doing impossible yoga poses or lifting weights. Those abs, she admits, have not shaped themselves\n\n\u2018I sleep well on a plane, it\u2019s a blessing. My team think I\u2019m crazy, but I\u2019m trying to embrace the madness.\n\n'Coping with it is about a frame of mind. When you have to land and work, and do two shows back-to-back, there\u2019s no time to complain or think about being tired.\u2019\n\nA conversation with Nicole, 41, doesn\u2019t half make you feel lazy.\n\nShe might have been born in Honolulu, Hawaii \u2013 surely the most chilled out place \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing laidback about her attitude.\n\nI go through phases. Like with the gym, I will go for weeks without working out, but then I\u2019ll say, 'OK, I\u2019d better get back into it.'\n\n\u2018I go through phases,\u2019 she admits. \u2018Like with the gym, I will go for weeks without working out, but then I\u2019ll say, \u201cOK, I\u2019d better get back into it.\u201d\n\n'I fluctuate, like a lot of women, and it\u2019s nice to take a break sometimes. But when you\u2019re wired like me, it\u2019s often the other way.\u2019\n\nHer Instagram is full of pictures of her in Lycra, doing impossible yoga poses or lifting weights. Those abs, she admits, have not shaped themselves.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m constantly working on myself,\u2019 she says. \u2018On my body. If you want a good body you have to work on it, but for me exercise is as much about my mental state too.\n\n'I need it to burn off steam. It\u2019s about frame of mind, maybe even more so than about the physical side.\u2019\n\nNicole started as a singer herself. She sold 54 million records as part of The Pussycat Dolls, and 16 million as a solo singer.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Weber arranged for her to join the cast of Cats on Broadway after a run in the show in the West End, but things went horribly awry when Nicole pulled out at the last minute, choosing to go with The X Factor. Pictured, Nicole on stage on the West End\n\nPresumably, signing up as a TV judge was partly to do with upping her profile and selling more records? She laughs. \u2018I\u2019d love to be able to say that, but with my terrible history I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever released a song off the back of these damn shows.\u2019\n\nYet look at how many of \u2018these damn shows\u2019 there have been. She\u2019s appeared on both the US and UK versions of The X Factor as well as Australia\u2019s Got Talent, and she\u2019s clocked up stints as a contestant on Dancing With The Stars (she won, naturally) and I Can Do That, in which the contestants have to master a new skill (yep, she won that too).\n\nThis year she will appear on five different shows, across the world. \u2018I am doing a lot this year \u2013 five shows \u2013 but next year I will take a break and focus more on the music. But it\u2019s not as if I sought out all these shows in different countries.\n\nThere\u2019ll always be an industry. People still go to see Paul McCartney. I went to see Sade recently, and I love the idea of, in my 60s or 70s, singing with a little jazz band or doing a musical.\n\n'I\u2019m just grateful to be asked. If an opportunity comes along, I will seize it.\u2019\n\nThere have been rumours that The Pussycat Dolls are about to reform. No confirmation of that now, but she does admit she misses touring, and the music side of her career. \u2018It\u2019s my first love, where my talent truly lies,\u2019 she admits.\n\n\u2018I put a lot of hard work and heart into whatever I do, but a lot of people can do that. What separates me is the music. I feel as if I\u2019m just beginning with the music.\n\n'There\u2019ll always be an industry. People still go to see Paul McCartney. I went to see Sade recently, and I love the idea of, in my 60s or 70s, singing with a little jazz band or doing a musical.\u2019\n\nShe has allied herself with, and been mentored by, two of the biggest names in entertainment.\n\nDo Simon Cowell and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who convinced her into musical theatre in Cats, have much in common personality-wise?\n\nNicole credits family with helping to keep her calm and grounded. Pictured, with sister Keala\n\n\u2018They are very different,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s like two parts of the brain. Simon is more business, Andrew is more creative, he\u2019s a master at music.\u2019\n\nHe was once her greatest cheerleader. At a time when some dismissed her as a pop singer, Andrew identified her as a future great of musical theatre.\n\nHe arranged for her to join the cast of Cats on Broadway after a run in the show in the West End, but things went horribly awry when Nicole pulled out at the last minute, choosing to go with The X Factor.\n\nAndrew was livid, and said so.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m furious \u2013 I really believe she\u2019s the most fantastically talented girl and I went out on a limb to get her for the London Palladium, and it makes me look like an absolute twot with them all,\u2019 he said.\n\nI had a lot of struggles with self-esteem and a lot of insecurities later on that resulted in me having eating disorders because of my body dysmorphia\n\n\u2018But never mind, there\u2019ll be another girl on Broadway and Nicole will not get her Tony award.\u2019\n\nOuch! \u2018It\u2019s OK. He had every right to feel that way,\u2019 she says today.\n\n\u2018He fought for me, and I always said I would make it up to him. That relationship means a lot to me because he believed in me from the start, when others didn\u2019t.\n\n'Andrew and his family have been nothing but good to me. It was such a passionate reaction from him, but you can\u2019t knock someone for that.\u2019\n\nBut by her own admission, singing is what she\u2019s best at. Was it not a mistake turning down a Broadway role?\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to have regrets,\u2019 she says. \u2018You can\u2019t go back in time. But Andrew and I have rekindled our friendship and I look forward to other projects.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s much chat today of embracing spirituality, not being too hard on herself and \u2018learning to be kinder\u2019.\n\nNicole Sherzinger has judged on previous X factors with Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh. She is pictured here in the 2017 series of the programme\n\nAll this is at odds with her schedule, which suggests she\u2019s one of the toughest cookies in showbiz. Her journey through the industry has been turbulent, though.\n\nAfter she left The Pussycat Dolls she admitted she\u2019d suffered from an eating disorder at the peak of their fame. Insecurities have always haunted her, she admits.\n\nWhen did it start?\n\n\u2018I\u2019d always felt that way. I had a lot of struggles with self-esteem and a lot of insecurities later on that resulted in me having eating disorders because of my body dysmorphia.\n\n'I was just really hard on myself growing up and I didn\u2019t like myself very much.\n\nIf you want to have a good body you have to work on your body, and if you want a good mental state you have to work on it too. It\u2019s a battle out there\n\n'My 20s were when it was most raging. We had so much success with the Dolls, but I was not as balanced, let\u2019s just say. I\u2019ve had to work on that.\u2019\n\nWas the problem with her, or the industry she was in?\n\n\u2018Oh, definitely me. You have to take responsibility, although being a part of the industry doesn\u2019t make it any easier. I was hard on myself because I chose to be hard on myself.\n\n'I was a perfectionist, insatiable, nothing ever seemed enough. I was never good enough. But what I\u2019ve learned is that you do have a choice. You have to fight it.\u2019\n\nIs it an ongoing fight, or in the past?\n\n\u2018Oh, an ongoing fight. I am very spiritual so I like things to be in peace and alignment. The way the world is wired is not spiritual. We have to battle to keep ourselves in peace.\u2019\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound as if she enjoyed her 20s, and she admits she wishes she could have them over again.\n\nThe Islanders: Who are they? (L-R) Wes Nelson, Zara McDermott, Eyal Booker and Samira Mighty all appeared on series four of reality dating show Love Island\n\n\u2018I do. I really do. That\u2019s why I want to be positive now, and seek any positivity because time goes by so fast, and it tries to steal it from you. It\u2019s like a thief in the night, stealing joy, and you don\u2019t want your joy to be stolen.\u2019\n\nI ask if there was a specific moment she found she was happy, and she says, \u2018No, I\u2019m still searching. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s happiness we should be looking for, it\u2019s more the search for meaning.\n\n'I\u2019m constantly in search of that. Happiness is more of a choice.\u2019 Hard work, though. \u2018Yes. If you want to have a good body you have to work on your body, and if you want a good mental state you have to work on it too. It\u2019s a battle out there.\u2019\n\nSo how does she keep her mental health in tip-top condition? \u2018Counselling, yoga, church, life coaches, psychiatrists, meditation, prayer, running, dancing, family, my nieces... everything.\u2019\n\nYou need someone that lifts you up and supports you, someone who understands the ambition\n\nHer personal life is a bit of a closed book. She famously dated Formula 1 champ Lewis Hamilton and more recently Bulgarian tennis ace Grigor Dimitrov, but in August she let slip that she was single on Australia\u2019s Got Talent. So is she?\n\n\u2018We\u2019re so fortunate to live in a world where women are more encouraged and celebrated for having a career and ambition,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Of course, that comes with an element of compromise when it comes to your personal life. You need someone that lifts you up and supports you, someone who understands the ambition.\n\n'But that commitment, along with schedules, travel, distance and time, is always something that is going to be challenging, and I\u2019ve had to deal with these difficulties.\u2019\n\nRealistically, she can\u2019t have much time for a private life.\n\nTry Star: Who are they? Three-piece made up of former sportsmen Thom Evans (L) Levi Davis (C) Ben Foden (R). They will compete on The X Factor: Celebrity\n\nShe managed to get back home to Hawaii for her birthday this year and spent time with her sister and nieces, which cheered her up. \u2018She\u2019s my only sister, the yin to my yang. She\u2019s the better half of me,\u2019 she says of Keala.\n\nShe admits her mum (\u2018the biggest influence in my life\u2019) does want her to settle down and have kids too.\n\n\u2018All parents do. They just want happiness and family for their children. It is tough for my mum because she sees how hard I work. She wants me to not have to do so much, but she also knows that this is how her daughter is wired.\u2019\n\nDoes she want children? \u2018I definitely want a family and kids, but I always say, \u201cIn God\u2019s timing\u201d. My mum had two children so I guess I always thought I\u2019d have as many as my mum.\u2019\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to be married, or even in a relationship, to have kids these days, but she baulks at the idea of going it alone. \u2018No, I\u2019m quite traditional.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s also traditional in that she goes to church every week, which will surprise some. \u2018I have to. I pray every day. I don\u2019t really know how I would be able to get on if I didn\u2019t believe in a higher power than myself. We are flawed as human beings. My faith is everything that is good about me. It keeps me solid, on purpose.\u2019\n\nQuite what they\u2019d make in her church of the rugby boy band and their oiled torsos is unclear, but since they\u2019ve made her smile, we reckon they\u2019d approve.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity begins on Saturday 12 October on ITV", "description": "Nicole Scherzinger discussed returning to British screens for X Factor: Celebrity.
