Most of them like and respect her for her service and still smart over her 2016 loss to Donald Trump. But the sentiment that her time has passed is one shared by moderates and liberals alike.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good for her,\u201d said Montana Sen. Jon Tester. \u201cShe\u2019s been through this war once. The Republicans have made a target out of her for 30 years and she\u2019s still going to [be] that same target. I just think it would be tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be a mistake,\u201d said Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. Asked to expound, he repeated: \u201cThat would be a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\n\nPhilippe Reines, Clinton\u2019s longtime aide and adviser, doesn\u2019t see things that way. On Fox News this week, he declined to rule out a Clinton bid and said that \u201cthere might be a reason that she\u2019d be the best person\u201d to take on Trump and govern in the aftermath. But he also acknowledged she\u2019d have to win a crowded primary, a difficult endeavor.\n\nClinton herself invited the scrutiny, jokingly replying, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d when Trump tweeted that Clinton should take on Sen. Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic nomination. Meeting the fundraising and polling thresholds to qualify for the debates likely wouldn\u2019t be a problem. And she's already shown a willingness to mix it up with at least one other candidate \u2014 having swiped at Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting the Hawaii lawmaker is being backed by the Russians.\n\nBut most of her Democratic allies don\u2019t take the buzz seriously and say they are happy with the field as it is, despite griping by some in the establishment about the current roster of Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of really fantastic candidates out there already. Let's leave it at that,\u201d said Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono.\n\nDemocrats also don\u2019t believe Clinton herself has any real interest in being a candidate again. Her political career has been a grueling one: first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, U.S. senator, secretary of State and presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cI can sort of see the expression on her face, of sort of disbelief and dismissal,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal on Clinton seeing reports that she might make a third run for president. \u201cIt\u2019s just my instinct that there\u2019s no way she wants to go through this meat grinder again.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, every female Democratic senator signed on to a letter to Clinton encouraging her to run for the presidency. By 2015, most of the caucus had coalesced behind Clinton, cutting off oxygen to any potential opponents. Only one Democratic senator, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, ended up endorsing Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nClinton\u2019s coronation by the party establishment left many Democrats feeling burned, particularly after she ended up losing to Trump. And today\u2019s landscape couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether the world has passed on or not,\u201d said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of hers and I\u2019m extraordinarily fond of her. But that\u2019s a factor.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

And former Vice President Joe Biden already has a bloc of senators and congressmen backing him, including Feinstein. Candidates like Andrew Yang and Pete Buttigieg offer options from outside the Beltway.\n\nNone of that would change if Clinton got in.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that [Clinton] would want to get back in the race,\u201d said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who said she prefers candidates from the middle of the country. \u201cIf she wants to, then she goes through the same process as everyone else. And we\u2019ll see what she says in the debates.\u201d\n\nWhat is true is that many in the party are anxious about what lies ahead. The House is plunging into impeachment, the Senate will have to hold a trial and Democratic voters have a long way to go in pruning the field of presidential contenders.\n\nYet Democrats largely believe that reaching back into 2016, when Clinton handily won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Trump, isn\u2019t the antidote for the party\u2019s current plight. It would shake up the race, but perhaps not in a good way.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure we want to stay united. There are good people that are running. I can support any one of them,\u201d said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin.\n\n\u201cThe field is somewhat set,\u201d added Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), shaking his head when asked whether Clinton should reconsider. \u201cI think we need to move forward.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/13/44/797a1bd64d8e805dd498380ab5f9/191024-hillary-clinton-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
