But they never thought they would find a royalty check made out to Nirvana's lead singer, Kurt Cobain.\n\nEasy Street Records found a check from Broadcast Music Inc. that was made out to Kurt D. Cobain of Olympia, Washington. It was dated March 6, 1991, a few months before Nirvana made it big with its rock album \"Nevermind.\"\n\nStore owner Matt Vaughan said he was tidying in the basement when he found the uncashed $26.57 check tucked in a collection of the rock band's tour itineraries. He had bought the itineraries along with a box of records back in 1993.\n\n\"Last week, I was moving some stuff around and guess found a moment of reflection, sat there in the basement and flipped through every page,\" he told CNN. \"That's when these thin pieces of paper dropped out.\"\n\nCobain's royalty check isn't the only thing Vaughan and his staff have found.", "description": "Staffers at this Seattle record store are used to coming across rare finds.
