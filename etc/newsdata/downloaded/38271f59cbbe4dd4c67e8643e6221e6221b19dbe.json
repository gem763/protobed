The cable TV powerhouse controls such brands as the Food Network, Animal Planet, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, TLC and 15 other channels. A possible acquisition of Lions Gate, the studio that produced such theatrical feature films as \u201cHunger Games,\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and \u201cTwilight,\u201d also owns the premium cable channel Starz, and may be the more likely target particularly if its current valuation declines, these people said (Last week reports surfaced that Comcast may stop carrying Lions Gate\u2019s largest channel Starz\u2014a move that could depress Lions Gate\u2019s price tag).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Viacom spokesman had no comment.\n\nThe long-awaited reunion of CBS and Viacom, came after years of bickering and deliberating between the boards of the respective companies, which are controlled by Sumner Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, Inc.\n\nThe merger is seen as a significant victory for Shari Redstone who is now the de facto chief of National Amusements in lieu of her ailing father. Though the Redstones hold a controlling stake in both companies, the merger had been resisted by former CBS CEO Les Moonves, then one of the most powerful media executives in the business.\n\nMoonves fought for and won a court settlement that would delay any merger for years. But with Moonves\u2019 ouster in 2018 over sexual harassment allegations and newly reconstituted CBS board members in line with her goals, the deal talks reignited in March, as first reported by FOX Business.\n\nAmid the merger talks, speculation swirled that Shari Redstone was looking to make her media empire even larger by adding a few more crown jewels to the family. CBS and Viacom control some of the most iconic brands in the media business, such as 60 Minutes, various sports programming, network sitcoms, as well as MTV and Nickelodeon, respectively.\n\nBut the combined market capitalized of Viacom-CBS of around $26 billion will be dwarfed by bigger players such as Comcast, valued at $207 Billion, Disney, worth $248 billion and AT&T\u2013owners of Warner Media--at $261 billion. With that, speculation began to swirl that to remain competitive, Bakish and his boss Shari Redstone would immediately seek acquisitions such as Discovery or Lions Gate. \u201cViacom and CBS are two relatively tiny companies,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIn a world where scale is hundreds of billions of dollars, they are still a pimple in the media landscape.\u201d\n\nBut the market had other ideas for the nascent company. Amid the deal announcement shares began to tumble as investors began to consider the combination of what was viewed as relatively weak cost savings (a projected $500 million) plus a possible buying spree.\n\nWith that Bakish took to the road this week to set the record straight. Or as a company source told Fox Business, \u201cViacom will not be a buyer of last resort.\u201d", "description": "Bob Bakish tells investors ViacomCBS will be \"highly disciplined\" when it comes to M&S.", "authors": ["Lydia Moynihan", "Charles Gasparino"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Bob-Bakish.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
