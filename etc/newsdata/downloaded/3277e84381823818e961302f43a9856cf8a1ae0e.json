The greater the security of an individual\u2019s own little kingdom, even greater would be his fear of being exiled from it.\n\nBut need it be so? One does not ask for exile, but if it does come, it need not break us. One Indian Idol who weathered exile admirably was Ram.\n\nContrast what we know of his 14 years in exile with the rest of his earthly existence. It was the exile and the accompanying adversity, and not the Ramrajya that Ayodhya experienced later, that defined Ram as Maryada Purushottam.\n\nHis greatest victory, the conquest of Lanka, happened in his moments of greatest despair, when, living the life of a commoner, he grieved the fate of his father who died of sorrow.\n\nRam\u2019s wife Sita was abducted and his brother suffered grievous injury fighting by his side. In that process he transcended the lives lived by hundreds of other princes and emerged an icon.\n\nIn exile, Ram tested and found the limits of his own resilience, won the undying loyalty of a devoted Hanuman, and became immortal in our collective memory.\n\nDare we pose the question that had his life adhered to the original script, would he have been any different from the hundreds who wore a crown?\n\nNot all those who face trials may have kingdoms to return to, but those with character and resilience have little to fear from being asked to let go. Subhash Bose opted out of the ICS; he became Congress president.\n\nThere came a time when not only was he persecuted by the colonial regime, he was also shunned by the Congress. Undeterred, Bose made a place for himself in a new land.\n\nIn the corporate world, head honchos are often exiled and that too, abruptly. When Lee Iacocca found that he was no longer needed where he was boss, he started afresh with a defunct alternative and lo and behold, he only rose further in stature.\n\nOur lives don\u2019t always bring to us coronations we think we deserve. Perhaps we should stop fretting and, instead, look forward to what opportunities exile might bring.\n\nIt is better to trust in ourselves, relish the opportunities to rediscover our abilities in unexpected situations, and celebrate the moments when we step into periods of supposed exile with as much gusto as our homecomings.\n\nVivekananda wrote: \u201cThe whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you. Depend on no one. The moment you reject all help, you are free\u201d.\n\nIf we accept coronations and exile as they come \u2013 looking to no one for help in either obtaining the former or avoiding the latter \u2013 we are less likely to fret over the loss of temporary kingdoms.\n\nAfter all, they come and go, just like we do.", "description": "To lose a coveted position, and to face diminished stature and influence is not easy.
