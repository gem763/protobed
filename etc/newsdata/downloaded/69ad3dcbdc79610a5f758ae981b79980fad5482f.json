Adam wrote to the Kerala government seeking help with gaining his commercial pilot license. Now, the Govt has stepped in, offering to pay his fees at the Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology in Thiruvananthapuram, making Adam the country\u2019s first transgender commercial pilot.\n\nThe Social Justice department of the Kerala government has sanctioned Rs 23 lakh as Adam\u2019s fees for the three-year course. Adam already has a private pilot license but, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), a pilot has to complete a minimum of two hundred hours of flying time to qualify for a commercial pilot license.\n\nHarry told a leading news agency that broke this story that \u201che had no hope of getting the funding to pursue his childhood dream of becoming an airline pilot after the several obstacles he faced from family and friends. I am grateful to the Kerala government for this help.\u201d Adam earned his private pilot license in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2017 but at that time his family didn\u2019t know of his trans status.\n\nKerala is paving the way on how trans people ought to be treated and given their place in society. Earlier this year, voters could choose \u2018transgender\u2019 as sex on their voter ID cards. Last month, 22-year-old Heidi Saadiya became the first trans woman journalist for Kairali News. Trans people who want sex reassignment surgeries can head to government hospitals as they have been made completely free since 2018.\n\nIn the Kannur district, government funds have specially been allocated solely towards training trans people and giving them employment opportunities. Kochi also has the first all-trans school, which was started by trans activist Vijayraja Mallika, and has students between the ages of 25 and 50 years of age. The main objective of this school is to help students clear the board exams and get vocational training so that they can get jobs. The school also has transgeder teachers and one seat reserved for disabled students.\n\nWe gotta agree with John Abraham on his response about Kerala not being Modi-fied!\n\n\n\n", "description": "20-year-old Adam Harry, an aspiring pilot, was thrown out of his house because he was trans.
