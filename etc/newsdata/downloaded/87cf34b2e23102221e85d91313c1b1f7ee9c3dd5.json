Its strong performance on the Australian sharemarket is being driven by expectations of further US growth.\n\nMr Summers, one of the world's best known economists and a former economic adviser to president Barack Obama, said Afterpay is \"reinventing the way people shop and pay with alternatives to traditional credit that encourage responsible spending and control in how consumers pay\".\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with the leadership team to make the most of the opportunity before them,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe other members of the new US advisory board are former Reebok CEO Uli Becker and Matthew Kaness, former CEO of ModCloth, a US women's fashion retailer.", "description": "The former US Treasury Secretary says he wants to work with Nick Molnar to \"make the most of the opportunity\" in offering alternatives to traditional credit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dbdc3b8f9a47106f7790fa67ea85311e35dd38d9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
