She was quite sure that life in the bluegrass state would be \u201ca year-long Derby Day,\u201d but Depression-era Baileyville is a few mint juleps short. Not only is small-town life stifling, but her husband\u2019s golden boy charm does not transfer to the bedroom, and her father-in-law \u2014 the coal king with a violent nature \u2014 is employing questionable practices in his mine and acting even worse at home. Alice and her stiff upper lip are ready to accept this lot until the pack horse program comes recruiting.\n\nAlice has her britches on before her husband can say neigh, following the group\u2019s bold leader Margery O\u2019Hare up into the mountains. Margery \u2014 who is trying to shake her family\u2019s feuding, fighting and hard drinking reputation \u2014 is blazing her own trails with an appealing blend of feminism and free-spiritedness. She\u2019s the catalyst for change that Alice, and the isolated mountain families they are serving, desperately need. Together with three other librarians, including Sophia Kenworth, an African American woman whose brother was injured in the mines, they find a room of their own: a library that provides inspiration and escape.\n\nBut in town, their work is questioned, especially by the elder Van Cleve who is certain Margery is spreading a pro-union message along with those copies of \u201cLittle Women.\u201d Cries of impressionable young minds and rumors that the \u201cEnglish girl is really a Communist\u201d and that a girl armed with a book \u201chas grown hair on the back of her hands,\u201d start growing louder. But they are matched by the bellows that the children following them down the streets let out, \u201cbegging for something to read.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe flames of learning, the sparks set by these venturesome women, threaten to ignite the town, but if the wind blows the right way, they might set it on a new and better course.\n\nThe first time they ride through the mountains together, Alice asks Margery, \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been further east than \u2014 where was it, Lewisburg? \u2014 how is it you know so much about animals in Africa?\u201d Margery yanks her mule to a halt. \u201cAre you seriously asking me that question?\u201d she demands. The answer, of course, is because of books. Books that brought stories of Africa to Appalachia and books that continue to bring us all a slice of the world.\n\nThough she made her mark writing contemporary romance, Moyes proves just as adept at historical fiction, gracefully infusing her story with strong, memorable female characters and a sprinkling of men who can make a \u201cheart flutter like a clean sheet on a long line.\u201d \u201cThe Giver of Stars\u201d is a celebration of love, but also of reading, of knowledge, of female friendship, of the beauty of our most rural corners and our enduring American grit: the kind of true grit that can be found in the hills of Kentucky and on the pages of this inspiring book.\n\nKarin Tanabe is the author of \u201cThe Diplomat\u2019s Daughter\u201d and \u201cThe Gilded Years. Her fifth book, \u201cA Hundred Suns,\u201d will be published in April.\n\nTHE GIVER OF STARS\n\nBy Jojo Moyes\n\nPamela Dorman. 400 pages. $28.00\n\nAD", "description": "Though she made her mark writing contemporary romance, Moyes proves just as adept at historical fiction.", "authors": ["Karin Tanabe"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IgMKLNwVn2jyxM3sOSzTaY-8znQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCKPTHXFFEI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
