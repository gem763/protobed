That May, a pro-Trump super PAC reported receiving a $325,000 donation from an energy company the duo had recently formed.\n\nAD\n\nWhere Parnas and Fruman got their money remains a mystery. When they were arrested Wednesday on allegations of campaign finance violations, prosecutors alleged that Parnas and Fruman were backed in part by an unnamed Russian national who used them to funnel donations to state and federal candidates.\n\nThis summer, Parnas had begun working as a translator for the legal team of Dmytro Firtash, an Ukrainian gas tycoon who faces bribery charges in the United States, according to Victoria Toensing, one of Firtash\u2019s lawyers. The energy magnate has been accused by federal prosecutors of having ties to Russian organized crime and has been fighting extradition to the United States from Austria. Firtash has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nAs they scaled the ranks of Trump\u2019s Washington, Parnas and Fruman demonstrated a remarkable facility for capitalizing on their newfound connections, according to people who observed them. They also appeared to be constantly in pursuit of new business ventures \u2014 \u201calways hustling,\u201d in the words of one Trump ally who interacted with them.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2018, they hired the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to serve as a consultant as they launched a security business \u2014 and then helped Giuliani, in turn, reach Ukrainian officials in his quest to find information damaging to Democrats.\n\nDuring a visit to Israel last summer sponsored by a pro-Israel charity, Parnas and Fruman were \u201cmega-dropping Rudy\u2019s name\u201d as they snapped photos with well-known figures, according to former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was also on the trip.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c \u2018We\u2019re best friends with Rudy Giuliani,\u2019 \u201d Scaramucci said the two men told him. \u201c \u2018We work with him on everything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s ties to the duo are now under scrutiny by both federal prosecutors and congressional investigators seeking to unravel how two businessmen trailed by creditors and failed past ventures came to be at the center of an expanding international drama.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing. He said Friday that he had seen the two men \u201cquite often.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no reason to believe that they are anything other than decent guys,\u201d he said.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who made a brief court appearance Thursday in Alexandria, have not entered a plea to the charges against them.\n\nAD\n\nTheir new lawyer, John Dowd \u2014 who also previously served as a personal attorney for Trump \u2014 declined to respond to a number of questions about the two men, writing only in an email, \u201cYou publish at your peril.\u201d\n\nElite Trump circles\n\nParnas, 47, was born in Ukraine but moved with his family to the U.S. as a child and grew up in Brooklyn. He told The Washington Post in an interview conducted before his arrest that he got his start in real estate, selling Trump condos for Donald Trump\u2019s father, Fred, then worked in shipping in the former Soviet Union before becoming a securities trader. He moved to Florida in the mid-1990s.\n\nAD\n\nPeople who encountered the two men in recent years said that Parnas did most of the talking and seemed to be the public face of their U.S. partnership. But Parnas told The Post that Fruman was the one with especially deep connections in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nBorn in Belarus, Fruman, 53, owns a luxury jewelry business, a luxury car dealership and a hotel in Odessa, the port city on the Black Sea. He also owns an import-export business based in New York.\n\nBoth men have been trailed by financial problems, including a lawsuit filed against them earlier this year claiming they had failed to repay a $100,000 loan in 2018. The suit has been settled.\n\nParnas told The Post that he got involved in the Trump campaign because he admired the real estate developer, whom he said he had met several times before the election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was really passionate about the president,\u201d he said. \u201cI started really believing that he could really make a change and make it happen. Then I jumped on the campaign, donated money and became a really big believer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNow, Parnas said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to go down as one of the greatest presidents ever, even with all this negativity.\u201d\n\nAs for Giuliani, Parnas said he had met the former New York mayor during the campaign but that the relationship \u201cbonded and built over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just very close,\u201d he said, calling Giuliani \u201ca very good friend.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Friday that he recalls first meeting Parnas and Fruman in \u201cmid-to-late 2018\u201d after a lawyer who is a friend referred them to him.\n\nAt the time, Giuliani said, the men were ramping up a company called Fraud Guarantee, which would use specialized software to identify possible fraud in companies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know a lot about cybersecurity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they wanted my advice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani said his security consulting firm did \u201cintense\u201d work for the two men in 2018 and 2019, providing paid advice on how to structure their company.\n\nAround the same time, the two men began to appear regularly at elite Trump-related events and started to track their travels on Facebook and Instagram. Their posts have now been deleted, but were captured by BuzzFeed and other news organizations before they were taken down.\n\nFruman posted photos of himself at a Republican National Committee fundraiser at Trump\u2019s estate Mar-a-Lago in March 2018. In one, he was standing in front of a Florida flag next to Trump, who offered two thumbs up for the camera.\n\nAD\n\nThat May, Parnas posted photos and videos on Facebook that he wrote were taken at the White House, including one of him beaming as he stood next to the president between two American flags, giving a thumbs-up. \u201cThank you President Trump !!!\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTen days later, Fruman told the Brooklyn-based Russian-language publication Jewish World that the two men had been part of a group of just eight people who met privately with the president and discussed the upcoming midterm elections. Fruman said he also had discussed Ukraine-U.S. relations at the dinner.\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment on the event.\n\nLater that month, Parnas posted a photo of himself and Fruman breakfasting at the Beverly Hills Hotel Polo Lounge with Donald Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks Jr., a close friend of the president\u2019s son and top RNC official. \u201c#Trump2020,\u201d he captioned the photo.\n\nAn attorney for Trump Jr. declined to comment. Hicks did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters outside the White House on Thursday, Trump said he doesn\u2019t know Parnas and Fruman, dismissing the photos of himself with the two men.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody. . . . I don\u2019t know about them; I don\u2019t know what they do. I don\u2019t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You\u2019d have to ask Rudy.\u201d\n\nParnas and Fruman were also patrons of the president\u2019s hotel.\n\nIn one five-week period between September 2018 and October 2018, the two men racked up more than $13,000 in charges at the Trump hotels in New York and Washington, according to a person familiar with their finances, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private information.\n\nIn December, they attended a White House Hanukkah party, posting a photo on social media that includes Giuliani, Trump and Vice President Pence. A White House aide said the event was attended by hundreds of people.\n\nThe two men also began donating liberally to federal and state political committees, including a $325,000 contribution in May 2018 to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action.\n\nAll told, the two and their energy firm contributed at least $630,000 to federal GOP candidates and PACs since 2016, campaign finance filings show.\n\nThe money also flowed to candidates in Nevada, Texas, West Virginia and Florida. Prosecutors now allege the campaign contributions were part of an illegal scheme to funnel foreign money to \u201cbuy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates\u2019 governments,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nThe two men, along with two other associates, are charged with laundering money through corporate bank accounts and using straw donors to obscure the source of their funds, including illegal foreign contributions.\n\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, said the super PAC is placing the contribution it received in a segregated bank account \u201cuntil these matters are resolved. We take our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously comply with the law.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said: \u201cAs the indictment states, neither the President nor the [Trump] campaign were aware of the allegations.\u201d\n\nPitching a gas deal\n\nOver the same period that they were cultivating political ties, Parnas and Fruman were involved with a dizzying array of business pursuits.\n\nApart from Fraud Guarantee, they planned to launch a recreational marijuana business in states such as Nevada with the Russian national, according to the indictment.\n\nParnas also received tens of thousands of dollars last year from the firm of Brian Ballard, a longtime Florida lobbyist who is close to Trump, according to a person familiar with Parnas\u2019s finances. Another person familiar with the arrangement said Parnas was paid to refer possible clients, but none were connected to Ukraine.\n\nIn April 2018, the two men incorporated their new company, Global Energy Producers, which purportedly intended to sell liquefied natural gas. Quickly, the two began an effort to export American gas into Ukraine through Poland.\n\nEfforts to bring more U.S. gas to Europe \u2014 particularly Ukraine, to reduce its dependence on Russian energy \u2014 have been a priority for the Trump administration.\n\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman had any particular experience in the energy world, but at an energy conference in Houston in March, they made a pitch to Ukrainian state oil and gas giant Naftogaz.\n\nParnas and Fruman approached a top official at Naftogaz, Andrew Favorov, regarding their venture, according Dale W. Perry, an American businessman close to Favorov, as well as another a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\n\nThen, in a conversation first reported by the Associated Press, Parnas and Fruman pitched their LNG business and their hope to soon see new leadership at Naftogaz that would be receptive to their proposal. They asserted that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who opposed replacing the company\u2019s chief executive, would soon be gone.\n\nBy May, Yovanovitch had been abruptly recalled from her post on Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nThe implication, according to the person familiar with the meeting, was that the men would help Favorov take the top job at Naftogaz and then begin selling LNG to the Ukrainian state gas conglomerate.\n\nFavorov declined the offer, Perry said. He said the Naftogaz official, a former business partner, contacted him soon afterward and described the encounter, which Favorov told Perry made him deeply uncomfortable.\n\nFavorov and Perry were particularly concerned by the efforts of private businessmen with personal motivations to push for the ouster of Yovanovitch, who they view as a conscientious public servant, Perry said.\n\n\u201cIf she can be removed, then anything is possible now,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWhere is the rule of law? Where is the stability?\u201d Favorov could not be reached for comment.\n\nParnas, speaking to The Post before his arrest, said nothing ultimately came of his efforts to launch the LNG venture in Ukraine, in part because of the attention he and Fruman received for their political activities with Giuliani.\n\n\u201cNow everybody is scared to do business with us,\u201d Parnas said.\n\nBacking Giuliani's efforts\n\nThe campaign against Yovanovitch was embraced by Giuliani as part of his broader effort to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals. Parnas and Fruman assisted him in that project.\n\n\u201cThey were helping me a lot in Ukraine,\u201d Giuliani said Friday.\n\nAccording to Parnas, he was sitting at lunch with Giuliani in late 2018 when the former New York mayor was approached by an American with information about Ukraine. On learning of Giuliani\u2019s interest in Ukraine, Parnas said he then worked to connect Giuliani with people in Ukraine who had information he believed could assist the effort.\n\n\u201cMe just being next to him, me being Russian speaking and having business there and knowing the culture and also knowing a lot of individuals and having a lot of relationships somehow just basically steamrolled into me taking an active role as a patriotic duty,\u201d Parnas said. \u201cAnd here we are now.\u201d\n\nParnas has said he helped set up a call for Giuliani in January 2019 with Viktor Shokin, a former Ukrainian prosecutor who has alleged that he was fired in 2016 for investigating a company whose board included former vice president Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Parnas said he and Fruman also connected Giuliani with Yuriy Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor until August.\n\n\u201cWe took it upon ourselves as our patriotic duty, basically, whatever information we could get, to pass it on and to basically validate it as best as we could,\u201d Parnas said.\n\nAmong other topics, Parnas has said he and Giuliani discussed Yovanovich, who was removed from her position in May on Trump\u2019s orders after a whisper campaign that she was disloyal to the president.\n\nProsecutors said Thursday that Parnas\u2019s efforts to remove Yovanovich came \u201cat least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Parnas has become even more financially entangled with Giuliani and his allies.\n\nIn an interview, Toensing said she and her husband, attorney Joe diGenova, retained Parnas this summer to work as a translator as they represent Firtash, who has been charged in Illinois with bribing Indian officials related to mining interests in that country. He is fighting extradition to the U.S. from Austria.\n\nFirtash, who U.S. prosecutors have alleged in court documents is an \u201cupper-echelon\u201d associate of Russian organized crime, has denied wrongdoing. Earlier this year, he hired Toensing and diGenova, who appear frequently on Fox News and are close to Giuliani.\n\nToensing said she was \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department charges against her client, adding that \u201cthe Indian government has investigated\u201d the bribery claim and filed no charges in the case. She said Firtash\u2019s Austrian extradition case included testimony from investigators who found that he had \u201cno ties to organized crime.\u201d\n\nToensing said she met Parnas through Giuliani and tapped him \u201cto be our translator to review documents and to help with Ukraine,\u201d noting that \u201che speaks Russian and our client does not speak English.\u201d\n\nParnas and Fruman\u2019s myriad political and business ventures came to an abrupt halt Wednesday.\n\nThe duo had lunched that day with Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHours later, they were at Dulles Airport, about to board a plane to Europe, when authorities in the hallway stopped them and asked to see their passports, according to a person who saw the encounter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nSoon, the person said, about a dozen plainclothes investigators converged on the scene, and the two men were led away.", "description": "Before they were arrested on campaign finance violations, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman demonstrated a facility for capitalizing on their political connections.", "authors": ["Rosalind S.
