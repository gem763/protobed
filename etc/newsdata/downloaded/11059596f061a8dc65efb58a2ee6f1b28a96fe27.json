In Gardiner\u2019s view, the White House \u2013 despite President Trump\u2019s earlier assertions that it would unleash economic fury on Ankara if it targeted the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds \u2013 is likely going to sit for a few days and assess the situation.\n\n\u201cThe president has sent a clear message to Turkey, and the U.S. clearly has an interest in avoiding conflict between Turkey and the Kurds,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cISIS, Russia and Iran all need to be kept at bay, and Turkey needs to be on the same page with it.\u201d\n\nA bipartisan Senate bill aimed at pausing U.S. military assistance to Turkey is expected to be introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., as early as next week when Congress returns from recess.\n\nThe measure would seek to sanction Erdogan and other top officials.\n\nTurkey has viewed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as being tightly allied to the PKK, a designated terrorist organization, and a separatist movement that has long waged war with Ankara in the rugged hills of the Turkish state. However, the U.S. \u2013 despite its NATO partnership with Turkey \u2013 backed and installed the SDF as the primary ground force to root out ISIS from the swaths of Syria that it overtook.\n\nDISPLACED 'ISIS-SUPPORTING WOMEN' REVOLT IN SYRIA BORDER CAMP AS TURKISH INCURSION GAINS MOMENTUM\n\nThe White House suddenly announced this past Sunday night that U.S. troops were withdrawing from their posts in northern Syria, and analysts quickly warned an escalation between Turkey and the SDF would create a chaotic void which adverse actors could exploit further.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns over the humanitarian crisis on the ground continued to unfold.\n\nAccording to Robin Fleming, a researcher at the Rojava Information Center, scores of civilians have escaped most of the border towns. Cars have been clogging the roads \u201cwith nowhere to go.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Turkey) is targeting military bases and civilian areas, they are trying to create an atmosphere of fear,\u201d she said Thursday afternoon, against a backdrop of bombs and shells blistering the night sky.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, Fleming also stressed that those on the ground welcomed Norway\u2019s decision not to export arms and were hopeful others in the international community will follow in their footsteps.\n\n\u201cIf more countries take that stance, apply sanctions or even just make a public declaration that they don\u2019t support (Turkish incursion), it could have a big effect,\u201d she added.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeastern Syria this week has not only been met with international condemnation \u2013 but it has also induced something of a schism between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
