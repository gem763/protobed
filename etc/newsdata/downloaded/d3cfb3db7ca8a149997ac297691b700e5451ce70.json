It will offer at least $45 billion at its 14-day term actions on Oct. 24 and Oct. 29, which is $10 billion more than previously. The increased size of the term operations will cover the Oct. 10 offering that matures Thursday as there is about $42.6 billion rolling off.\n\nRepo for the end of October is already elevated. The market for month-end on Wednesday showed funding rates spiking to around 2.20%, according to Stone & McCarthy. With an expected Fed rate cut next week, that would be above the central bank\u2019s likely new target range.\n\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense as they\u2019re hoping not to use any special large term repo operations in order to deal with month-end,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. \u201cTheir modus operandi has been to smooth out some of the maturities in term repo, which is why they made it more regular.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10% from around 2%. The Fed has also begun buying Treasury bills to add reserves into the system. These efforts have mostly calmed repo rates.", "description": "New York Fed Boosts Repo Operations to Quell Month-End Pressures", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic25018379ab60fc4638af1245ade88966.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
