Another round of collections for such case studies worldwide will start from now till the end of March.\n\nNicholas Rosellini, UN resident coordinator, said at the event that China has contributed immensely to realizing the first target of the UN's Millennium Development Goals, which is to halve the impoverished population globally.\n\nRosellini noted that China's poverty headcount ratio fell from 66.2 percent in 1990 to nearly zero as of 2015, measured by the global poverty line of $1.9 per day. During the 25-year period, over 600 million people rose out of poverty mostly because of its highly inclusive economic growth and government development programs.\n\n\"At present China's government, indeed China's entire society, is absorbed in the great battle to eliminate absolute rural poverty by 2020,\" he said, adding it is a grand mobilization of human and financial resources unseen in mankind's history.", "description": "China's expertise in poverty relief offers lessons for developing countries as the world faces an uphill struggle to eliminate extreme poverty globally by 2030, a World Bank official said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da6fcb9a310cf3e97a18d77.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
