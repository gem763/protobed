Oil prices rose to more than $100 a barrel in 2014 before a sharp drop that triggered a 2016 recession in Nigeria, leaving the government struggling to fund its budgets.\n\nA law dating back to the 1990s that governs oil production sharing contracts allows the government to review revenue sharing once the oil price rises above $20 per barrel.\n\nAbubakar Malami, the attorney general, said Nigeria had been \u201cshort-changed\u201d under the law and was pursuing a case for recovery if it was established that the oil companies had under-paid the government.\n\n\u201cComputing the amount that should be credited to the Nigerian government if the law was effectively applied, that translates to around $62 billion against the IOCs (international oil companies),\u201d said Malami in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cAll options are on the table and there is no limit to what we can do in terms of engagement, in terms of settlement, if the need arises,\u201d said Malami. He declined to name the oil companies involved in the matter.\n\nEarlier this year, industry and government sources told Reuters that Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Eni, were each asked to pay the central government between $2.5 billion and $5 billion.\n\nThe oil companies were not immediately available for comment.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday presented a record 10.33 trillion naira ($33.8 billion) budget for 2020 to lawmakers. He has repeatedly rolled out record spending plans but struggled to fund them due to lower oil output and an inability to boost non-oil exports.", "description": "Nigeria is seeking $62 billion from oil companies under regulations that allow the government to revisit revenue-sharing deals on petroleum sales if crude prices exceed $20 a barrel, the attorney general told Reuters on Thursday.", "authors": ["Alexis Akwagyiram", "Chijioke Ohuocha", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
