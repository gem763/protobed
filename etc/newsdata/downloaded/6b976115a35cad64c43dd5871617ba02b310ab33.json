She failed to address the core issues,\u201d said Alvin Yeung, a pro-democracy lawmaker. Her policy speech was \u201cthe last chance to address these pressing issues.\u201d\n\nBut Hong Kong people have grown increasingly irate as growing Communist Party influence has led to eroding rights, the issue that broadly underpins the ongoing protests that now form the most public, direct opposition to president Xi Jinping since he took the reins in 2012.\n\nAs unrest continues, politicians in the UK and US have grown more vocal for Beijing to seek a humane resolution, as state media videos of military buildup in neighbouring Shenzhen, sending an ominous sign.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US House passed by unanimous voice vote four pieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three of which were related to the protests in Hong Kong, drawing condemnation from Beijing.\n\nOne of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the US secretary of state to certify annually that Hong Kong remained sufficient autonomous to keep receiving special treatment that has allowed it to be a global financial hub.\n\nAnother measure would bar commercial exports of military and crowd-control gear that Hong Kong police could use against demonstrators.\n\nIn June, the UK halted all new export licenses of crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong.", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam abandoned a state-of-the-union style address after opposition politicians\u00a0heckled her in chaotic scenes inside the city\u2019s legislative chamber.
