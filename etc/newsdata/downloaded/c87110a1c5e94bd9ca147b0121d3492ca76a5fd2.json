A number of analysts warn that such a move could easily rebound on Beijing.\n\n\u201cIf China starts to play around with dumping U.S. Treasuries that would truly be shooting themselves in the head, because that kind of market disruption would hurt their holdings much more than anything else,\u201d William Lee, the Milken Institute\u2019s chief economist, tells Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\nGiven the size of China\u2019s holdings \u2014 and the growing tensions with the U.S. \u2014 the question has become fodder for market analysts. Many have warned for years that the federal government\u2019s endless deficit financing put the U.S. at risk for a reckoning with its creditors.\n\nRecently, Japan overtook China as the top foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with Beijing having slowly pared down its stockpile of American assets since last year.\n\nAccording to data from the Treasury Department, Japan\u2019s ownership grew to $1.12 trillion in June, while China\u2019s holdings increased for the first time in four months to $1.11 trillion.\n\nJapan is still a strong U.S. ally, but that\u2019s cold comfort to some worried that China could inflict real damage by selling Treasuries in bulk. But there are good reasons why it\u2019s not that simple, Lee said.\n\n\u201cBecause [China] have these huge holdings, they can\u2019t possibly dump all their holdings at once. Because what would they buy -- euros?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe U.S. has the largest and deepest bond market in the world, and European debt pales in comparison. That means China\u2019s options for shifting out of dollars are limited.\n\n\u201cSo because they can only do a little bit at a time, the large economic and financial market disruptions in asset prices would hurt them much more as holders of U.S. assets,\u201d Lee said.\n\nMcKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
