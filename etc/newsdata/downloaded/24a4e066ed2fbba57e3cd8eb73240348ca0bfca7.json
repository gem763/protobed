Let their families know what you think of their behaviour.\u201d\n\nIn the northern Australian state of Queensland, home to huge coal mines and Dutton\u2019s electorate, harsher penalties are being considered in response to their regular disruption of peak-hour traffic.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Burn capitalism, not petrol\u2019 \u2013\n\nExtinction Rebellion has scheduled non-violent protests chiefly in Europe, North America and Australia over the next fortnight.\n\nEvents will also be held in India, Buenos Aires and Cape Town.\n\nAn \u201copening ceremony\u201d Sunday evening attracted hundreds of people to central London, where plans are in place to shut down key sites including Westminster and Lambeth bridges, in addition to protests outside key government departments.\n\nHundreds of activists barricaded themselves inside a Paris shopping centre for hours over the weekend, unfurling banners with slogans such as: \u201cBurn capitalism, not petrol\u201d above restaurants and fashion boutiques.\n\nIn Delhi, one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities, dozens of protesters staged another preliminary event on Sunday by holing a \u201cdie-in\u201d on a road in the heart of India\u2019s capital.\n\nHolding up hands covered in red paint and signs such as \u201cThere is no planet B\u201d, they called on the Indian government to act to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I will have a future or not,\u201d Vansha Jain, 17, told AFP.\n\n\u201cI want to know I have a future. Because I have dreams, I am ambitious. I want to be things, I want to do things.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion was established last year in Britain by academics and has become one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing environmental movements.\n\nCampaigners want governments to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and be led by new \u201ccitizens\u2019 assemblies on climate and ecological justice.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Extinction Rebellion activists began gathering in cities across Australia and New Zealand on Monday to kick off a fortnight of global", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/60c701_we-petitions-lobbying-marches-now-time-is-running-out-extinction-rebellion-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
