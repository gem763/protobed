To mark Flag Day last year, CBS Philadelphia shared a guide on how to properly dispose of American flags.\n\nThis trooper is not the first person to gain widespread recognition for his proper handling of the flag. In 2018, a photo of three boys folding an American flag in Hayden, Idaho, went viral. Many praised the boys for their efforts to protect the flag.\n\nThe same year, a FedEx driver was praised for folding a flag that fell on a customer's lawn. The good deed was captured on the homeowner's security camera and went viral, CBS Baltimore reported.", "description": "The trooper is being praised for stopping his car and properly handling the fallen flag", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/e9a78e09-7c43-41d1-b50b-6b0d0774cc2d/thumbnail/1200x630/3f7cb5e972461dfe8443f01f631467cf/screen-shot-2019-10-11-at-9-22-27-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
