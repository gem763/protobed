We also do a lot of functional training exercises, which mimic daily life.'\n\nMelendez helped Dr Lushantha Gunasekera, an Orlando Health cardiologist, get rid of his back pain from standing or leaning over patients with simple exercises that 'mimic every day life'\n\nThat's what he did with Dr Lushantha Gunasekera, a cardiologist at Orlando Health, who spends much of his day on his feat but leaned over patients (or his phone).\n\n'I had pain in my back and neck on my right side, and I realized that's the side I always lean to when checking a patient or entering information into the computer during an exam,' said Dr Gunasekera.\n\nMelendez tested his client's posture with the 'W test.'\n\nTo do this, you stand against a wall, with your feet about six inches from the wall, but keep your lower back, elbows all touching it.\n\nAs you move your hands up and down the wall, you should be able to keep all points of contact intact - but many people can't, because their posture is suffering.\n\nMelendez also taught Dr Gunasekera to simply be mindful of his posture and engage his core - and the cardiologist says it's gone a long way to improve his posture and day-to-day life.\n\n'When I find myself reverting back to old habits, I think about sitting or standing straight and pulling my shoulders back,' said Gunasekera.\n\n'Discussing what I was doing incorrectly and working on my mobility and core has really helped, and the pain I had has been completely eliminated.'", "description": "Only 47% of Americans consider the effects of their smart phone use on their posture something to worry over, but they should be, as it could leave them with chronic pain, says an Orlando Health expert.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/23/19464316-0-image-a-21_1570572987000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
