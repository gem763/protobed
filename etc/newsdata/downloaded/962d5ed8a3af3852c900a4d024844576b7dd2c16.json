The company has not responded to Business Insider's request for comment on its next steps.\n\nBasketball is hugely popular in China, with the country boasting nearly 500 million viewers of NBA games last season on Tencent alone. In June, the NBA signed a five-year partnership with Tencent worth about $1.5 billion, the state-run CGTN news reported.\n\nThe Toyota Center in Houston, Texas \u2014 home of the Houston Rockets.

He added, however, that it was \"not the role of the NBA to adjudicate\" people's differences in opinion.\n\n\"One of the enduring strengths of the NBA is our diversity,\" he said. \"It is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\"\n\n\"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong continue to rage into their 18th week, with demonstrations becoming increasingly violent. Last week police shot a 18-year-old in the chest in their first use of live ammunition since June, and demonstrators threw acid at officers.\n\nRead more: Barricades, human chains, and battling tear gas: We followed Hong Kong activists through the city's most turbulent protests yet\n\nCarrie Lam, the city's leader, said on Tuesday that while she still wants demonstrations to end peacefully, the Chinese military could step in if the uprising \"becomes so bad.\"", "description": "The row started when Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, tweeted a graphic in support of the Hong Kong protests last week.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c5d084b650744002f3afe?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
