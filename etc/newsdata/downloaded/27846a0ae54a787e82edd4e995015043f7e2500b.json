Ellison stands accused of kidnapping and robbing Tekashi at gunpoint in July 2018. Mack allegedly peddled drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, and ecstasy.\n\nThe prosecution played excerpts from two music videos of Hernandez\u2019s songs, \u201cGummo\u201d and \u201cKooda.\u201d At prosecutors\u2019 request, Hernandez pointed out alleged gang members who appeared in these vids.\n\nWhen the excerpts played, Hernandez subtly but perceptibly nodded with the rhythm, sometimes moving his head from side to side in a swaying motion.\n\n\u201cI asked them if we could get some Nine Trey members to be part of the videos,\u201d Hernandez said of discussions about \u201cGummo\u201d prior to production.\n\nHernandez said he wanted the \u201caesthetic\u201d of \u201cGummo\u201d to reflect the Bloods offshoot.\n\n\u201cI wanted the video to be full red,\u201d Hernandez said, explaining that he bought dozens of red bandanas in preparation for the shoot.\n\nJurors were also provided transcripts of \u201cGummo\u2019s\u201d lyrics, including the lines \u201cN- - - -s iffy, uh, blicky got the stiffy, uh. Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh\u201d and \u201cIn the hood with them Billy n- - - -s, and them Hoover n- - - -s.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to explain the meaning of \u201cGummo,\u201d Hernandez said, \u201cIt was actually a diss song\u201d directed toward rapper Trippie Redd \u2014 who he also alleged was a member of another Bloods offshoot, Five Nine Brims.\n\nHernandez and Redd were on the same label.\n\n\u201cHe signed first. I signed after,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThere was a lot of jealousy involved.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his testimony, Hernandez was asked to point out Ellison and Mack.\n\n\u201cUh, Harv \u2026 he has a gray suit on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNuke \u2026 has the white thing on his head,\u201d Hernandez said, referring to a knit religious cap Mack was wearing.\n\nHe also said his former manager, Kifano \u201cShottie\u201d Jordan, taught him the gang handshake. He then demonstrated the Nine Trey sign. He curled his thumb into his index finger, like the nine-digit\u2019s shape, and let his three other fingers fan out.\n\nAsked who showed him how to make the sign, he replied, \u201cNuke.\u201d\n\nHernandez, who sported navy jail scrubs and fading pigtail braids, recalled that he decided to cooperate with the Feds one day after he and his former cronies were busted for racketeering.\n\nHe also recounted his entry into the business. The prospect of rapping came up when Hernandez was working at a grocery in Brooklyn. A man who bought tilapia and \u201cthings like that\u201d at the store told him Hernandez he \u201cgot the image for it, looked cool.\u201d\n\nA few years later, in fall 2017, Hernandez dropped \u201cGummo\u201d on YouTube.\n\n\u201cIt was [an] instant success, I would say,\u201d Hernandez testified.\n\nHe quickly picked up on the fact that Bloods-centric work would propel him to success.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a formula,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people liked.\u201d\n\nHe also said his role in Nine Trey was \u201ckeep making hits\u201d to financially support the gang.\n\nIn return, Hernandez got \u201cstreet cred\u201d and protection, he said.\n\nHernandez\u2019s testimony stems from a plea deal he brokered with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office; under the agreement, he copped to nine federal counts and agreed to cooperate with the Feds.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s obligations under this agreement are as follows: That he shall truthfully and completely disclose all information of the activities of himself and others to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and that he cooperate fully with law-enforcement agencies,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear said during the plea proceeding. \u201cIt is understood that the defendant\u2019s cooperation is likely to reveal the activities of individuals and that witness protection may be required at a later date.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Rebold portrayed Ellison and Mack as men who used violence to make money. Ellison was the gang\u2019s \u201csecond-in-command, enforcer, muscle.\u201d Hernandez promoted the gang through his music videos, making \u201cmoney, lots of money, for Hernandez and for Nine Trey\u2019s leaders and money for the gang.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this role, Ellison and others committed multiple violent crimes,\u201d Rebold said.\n\nEllison was eventually booted from his role as Hernandez\u2019s protector.\n\n\u201cThis did not sit well with Mr. Ellison,\u201d Rebold said.\n\nDuring the defense lawyers\u2019 opening statements, they cast Hernandez as an unreliable witness \u2014 a master troll who would do anything to go viral.\n\nEllison\u2019s lawyer, Devereaux Cannick, called the kidnapping a \u201choax.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Jussie Smollett,\u201d Cannick said, referring to the former Empire star who was said to have faked a racist and homophobic attack on himself in Chicago.\n\nHernandez will continue testifying on Wednesday.", "description": "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, legally Daniel Hernandez, testified in the racketeering case of Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods members, Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison and Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack.
