Ramaphosa said the government has set a goal to be within the top 50 of the ranking and has been engaging with business on reforms.\n\n\n\n\"All of us in this room share a common goal, to make South Africa the destination of choice for ease of doing business.\n\n\"We all want to build an economy that is more equitable and from which all South Africans can benefit,\" he said.\n\nRamaphosa further called on investors to make the most of the \"new momentum\" in the country.\n\n\"We want and need foreign direct investment, and scaled up domestic investment is the necessary catalyst. We all want to see a South Africa that is thriving and prosperous,\" he said.\n\nAttracting investment\n\nEarlier on Wednesday advisory firm EY released its report on investment flows on the continent which showed foreign direct investment in the continent is stable but still low by global standards.\n\nIn 2018 there were investment 710 projects in the continent which created 117 000 jobs and attracted $75.5bn in capital, according to the report. The US and France remain Africa's single largest investors and Egypt, South Africa and Morocco are three of the largest recipients of investment.\n\n\"Despite being a country critically lacking in consumer and business confidence, and with employment stubbornly high, it is encouraging that South Africa remains on investors' radar,\" Sandile Hlophe EY Partner noted.\n\n\"An urgent focus on implementing economic reforms as outlined in the President\u2019s economic stimulus and recovery plan announced in September 2018, and progressing State Owned Enterprise plans to strengthen governance and stabilise cash flows, will go a long way towards stimulating increased FDI flows,\" he said.\n\nThe report also shows South Africa is the fifth largest investor into the rest of the continent, after the US, France, UK and China.", "description": "Briefing business community leaders at a seminar organized by Brand SA, President Cyril Ramaphosa said government is making an effort to improve the ease of doing business in the country to attract more investment.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8416/4d620f561c93490da8e66eafbfded6aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
