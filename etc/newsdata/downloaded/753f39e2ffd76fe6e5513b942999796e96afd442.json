The Seahawks, who have shown a knack for winning tight games, were last unbeaten in their first three road games in 1980, when they went 4-12.\n\n\u201cThese guys are all together,\u201d said Seattle coach Pete Carroll. \u201cThey\u2019re committed. They care, and they\u2019re playing for each other.\u201d\n\nThe Browns (2-4) were hurt by their own miscues. They couldn\u2019t overcome three interceptions, a fumble, blocked punt or quarterback Baker Mayfield\u2019s hip injury.\n\nCleveland fell to 0-3 at FirstEnergy Stadium, and as Browns fans filed out, many were wondering what has become of a season they couldn\u2019t wait to get started.\n\nThe Browns also came out on the short end of several questionable calls by an officiating crew that had its hands full.\n\n\u201cThe refs are never an excuse,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI will probably get fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad today. \u2026 It ticks me off.\u201d\n\nMayfield\u2019s three picks raised his NFL-leading total to 11, and the second-year QB still hasn\u2019t found a rhythm. Trying to bring the Browns back late, Mayfield, who went to the locker room in the third quarter to be evaluated, was intercepted by Seattle\u2019s K.J. Wright with 2:41 remaining.\n\nThe Seahawks defenders celebrated the game-clinching turnover in front of Cleveland\u2019s Dawg Pound section, which pelted them with cans and other debris.\n\nWilson then ran out the clock as the Seahawks moved to 5-1 for the third time.\n\n\u201cIt was a crazy game,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was a battle. We were down 20-6 against a good football team with a lot of great players. We kept believing something great was going to happen and, sure enough, it did. In the fourth quarter we found a way again.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s short TD burst capped an efficient 79-yard drive by Wilson, who showed his usual poise and precision after the Browns had taken a 28-25 lead on Nick Chubb\u2019s 3-yard TD run.\n\nWilson finished 23 of 33 for 299 yards and stayed error-free. He has yet to throw an interception this season, and to this point, the eight-year veteran is outplaying every other QB in the league.\n\nMayfield, on the other hand, is struggling. He completed 22 of 37 passes for 249 yards, but he forced several throws and made a deliberate attempt to get the ball to Odell Beckham, who finished with six catches for 101 yards.\n\nCarson gained 124 yards on 24 carries for the Seahawks, who lost tight end Will Dissly in the first half with an Achilles injury. Dissly, whose rookie season was ended by a knee injury, left the stadium on crutches with his foot in an immobilizing boot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serious. It\u2019s a big loss,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing great football. It\u2019s a really devastating injury for him.\u201d\n\nEven after the Browns scored on their first three drives and opened a 20-6 lead, Wilson wasn\u2019t rattled.\n\nHe hung in the pocket and took a big hit from linebacker Joe Schobert \u2014 his teammate at Wisconsin \u2014 while completing a 17-yard TD pass with 22 seconds left in the half to pull the Seahawks within 20-18. Seattle\u2019s 2-point conversion failed, but the Seahawks were back in it after the Browns got greedy moments earlier.\n\nInstead of running the ball, first-year coach Freddie Kitchens called a pass play and Mayfield forced one into the end zone that was behind Jarvis Landry, tipped and intercepted by safety Tedric Thompson.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t move the ball if you turn the ball over,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cSimple as that. Execution. I have to call better plays, but it is execution and turning the ball over.\u201d\n\nN\u2019SYNC\n\nThe Seahawks had one of the season\u2019s best TD celebrations when four players lined up and mimicked boy band N\u2019Sync\u2019s \u201cBye, Bye, Bye,\u201d complete with choreographed dance moves.\n\nSTUNNING START\n\nThe Browns scored on the first play of the second quarter to go up 20-6. It was the first time Seattle allowed an opponent to score touchdowns on its first three drives since Dallas did it in 2008.\n\nNO SHAKE\n\nMayfield didn\u2019t participate in the pregame coin toss, his absence notable since it came just days after San Francisco cornerback Richard Sherman said the quarterback disrespected him by not shaking hands prior to kickoff.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBrowns: Mayfield downplayed his hip injury, which happened on a first-half scramble. \u201cIt hurts, but it\u2019s a physical game of football,\u201d he said. \u2026 DT Daniel Ekuale sustained a head injury in the closing minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeahawks: Host Baltimore on Oct. 20.\n\nBrowns: Have a bye next week before traveling to New England on Oct. 27.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 As rap music thumped from the large sound-system speakers sitting atop lockers at one end of the room, several Seattle players stood on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/bc6f07_seahawks-browns-football-96834-seattle-seahawks-quarterback-russell-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
