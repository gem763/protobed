He was 58.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his family, Johnston died of natural causes Wednesday morning at his Houston-area home. His brother, Dick Johnston, said Daniel had been plagued for years with health issues.\n\nHe was released from the hospital Tuesday after being treated with kidney problems, his brother told The New York Times.\n\nMusicians such as Kurt Cobain and Tom Waits, as well as \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, are among those who have expressed a fondness for Johnston's work.\n\n\"Not only was Daniel Johnston a legendary musician and artist who so authentically embodied Austin's soul and spirit, he also inspired many in our community to fight stigma associated with #mentalhealth issues,\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler tweeted.\n\nDaniel Johnston performs SXSW Music Festival on March 16, 2005, in Austin.

He started playing music at an early age, and he and his friends began recording tapes together when he was a teenager.\n\nHe then began what he described as a \"prolific\" period in his career as he recorded in his parents' cellar while rarely attending classes at an art program at Kent State. The tapes he made included \"Songs of Pain\" and \"More Songs of Pain.\"\n\nHe moved to Texas in 1983, first living in Houston and then San Marcos. While working at a carnival, he traveled to Austin \u2014 at the time the center of underground cool \u2014 and decided to stay. He continued to give out his tapes for free and record stores began selling them, which eventually got the attention of MTV's \"Cutting Edge.\"\n\nBailey Bailey hugs the frog-like creature known as \"Jeremiah the Innocent\" at the \"Hi, How Are You\" mural created by musician and artist Daniel Johnston on Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2019, in Austin, Texas.

Box in Austin. Through the \"hissy\" sound of the tape, Feuerzeig said he could tell Johnston was \"literally at the level of Bob Dylan or Lou Reed\" as a songwriter.\n\nFeurezeig said Johnston was \"very open\" about his mental illness. \"Back in the years in the '80s, when it was not a subject people were free to talk about \u2014 I think he's broken down a lot of those barriers because a lot of people suffer from this,\" Feuerzeig said.", "description": "\"The Devil and Daniel Johnston\" filmmaker Jeff Feuerzeig called him \"the greatest songwriter of my generation\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/0c646421-10c7-48b6-968d-4bddaf145c58/thumbnail/1200x630/f0c1a299c98e9cc45cafca83a5f2fe9d/gettyimages-52437990-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
