USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 If there\u2019s one constant for the Washington Nationals in the 2019 playoffs, it\u2019s that when they need a clutch hit, Howie Kendrick is going to come through.\n\nTheir biggest hit in National League Division Series was Kendrick\u2019s 10th-inning grand slam in the decisive fifth game against the Los Angeles Dodgers that propelled Washington into the NL Championship Series.\n\nThen Monday night against the St. Louis Cardinals, Kendrick capped a four-run third inning with a two-out, two-run double into the gap in right-center.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s built like a frickin\u2019 cinderblock. He\u2019s huge,\u201d said third baseman Anthony Rendon. \u201cHe\u2019s strong. So if he puts that barrel to it and stays behind the ball, you see it. He does damage.\u201d\n\nROBLES: Nationals' young CF delivers in return from injury\n\nALCS: Gerrit Cole is back to haunt the Yankees\n\nWith three doubles and three RBI in four at-bats Monday night in an 8-1 win, Kendrick raised his batting average this postseason to .314. With runners in scoring position, he\u2019s been even better: 5-for-10 (.500) with eight of his team-leading nine RBI.\n\n\"Howie has been setting the table the entire postseason,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. \u201cWhat a game by him tonight. I'm so happy for him after what he went through last year tearing his Achilles' and coming back.\u201d\n\nThe injury last year limited him to only 40 games, but it also steeled his resolve to make the most of the second year of his two-year contract.\n\n\u201cLast year was bittersweet because I got off to a good start and ruptured my Achilles,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cHaving the ability to come back this year and be a part of this team and to be with the guys in the locker room, that was huge.\u201d\n\nHowie Kendrick reacts after his seventh-inning double in Game 3.

But injuries have been a constant issue for him over the past few seasons.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked so hard to get back from his Achilles injury and he\u2019s worked tremendously on his swing with Kevin Long and it shows all the hard work pays off,\u201d said outfielder Adam Eaton. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him. I\u2019m so happy to be his teammate and it\u2019s a tremendous honor to be next to him.\u201d\n\nKendrick gives a lot of the credit for his career resurgence to the job Long has done as the team\u2019s hitting coach. He said the first time the two met, Kendrick asked what he could do to become a better hitter. He was surprised by the answer.\n\n\u201cHe had a list, like he had wrote down on a pad of paper,\u201d Kendrick recalled, gesturing to show that Long\u2019s list was really \u2026 well, long.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it \u2026 He goes, 'all right. This is what I know about you. This is what you hit with this, this, and this. We got to work from there.' \u201d\n\nWhen you'd expect him to the twilight of his 14-year career, Kendrick is having perhaps his best season ever.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, is all those failures, and even now my failures still help me be successful. You appreciate it even more,\u201d he said.\n\nHis teammates and his manager definitely appreciate him, especially since he\u2019s helped them get so close to the World Series.\n\n\u201cHe wants it, and the rest of his teammates feed off him,\u201d Nationals skipper Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019re all big fans of Howie \u2026 He\u2019s been that quiet leader for us all year long.\u201d", "description": "Washington's veteran infielder has come through with some of the biggest hits in the team's thrilling postseason run.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published A.M.
