'But she also didn't want to hurt her family.'\n\nLetty was a high-achieving student at Marshall Middle School in 2017 when she was drugged and taken by the sex trafficker not far from campus, according to her father.\n\nHe said he, and Letty's godmother, Cynthia Rivera, spent days searching for the teenager before tehy found her inside an abandoned home.

Her family rescued her after a few days, but they say she was not the same person\n\nMariano Serrano, Letty's father (left), and Cynthia Rivera, her godmother, now want the sex trafficker to face justice\n\n'We got her back damaged,' Rivera said.\n\nSince her rescue, Letty had run away from home twice to be with her abductor, who the family say preyed on the teen's weaknesses, including the fact that she was a loner at school and that her brother had recently died.\n\nTo make matters worse, Letty's godmother said the sex trafficker was freed just days after being arrested.\n\nNow, Rivera and Mariano Serrano are blaming the unnamed man for Letty's suicide and want him to face justice.\n\n'I want to see him in court,' the father told Fox 26. 'I want to tell him it's his fault my daughter is dead.'\n\nA commander with the Houston Police Department told the station that he is taking steps toward reopening the sex trafficking case involving Letty.\n\nMeanwhile, the girl's godmother has launched a fundraiser through Facebook to pay for her funeral.\n\nFor confidential support call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255.", "description": "Letty Serrano was 13 years old in 2017 when she was drugged and forced into a sex trafficking ring.
