The pizza giant is looking to impress investors and hopes Q3 will be a catalyst, with its shares down roughly 1% in 2019.\n\nInvestors are worried about Dominos\u2019 growth coming to a halt, as comp sales have trended lower over the past few quarters. Will Domino\u2019s post a strong third quarter that can finally catapult DPZ shares out of their slump?\n\nOverview and Q2 Recap\n\nDomino\u2019s boasts over 15,900 locations in more than 85 markets. In Q2, Domino's notched its 33rd consecutive quarter of growth in the core U.S. market and the 102nd straight quarter of gains internationally. The company\u2019s continued expansion in the second quarter outperformed Papa John\u2019s PZZA whose comp sales fell 6.8% in its last reported quarter.\n\nIn Q2, Domino\u2019s reported US same-store sales growth of 3.0% and international same-store sales growth of 2.4%. The pizza company reported total revenue of $811.6 million for a 4.14% gain, while earnings came in at $2.19 per share for a 23% jump. Earnings beat our estimates by 9.5% and revenue missed our estimate by 2.59%. US company-owned stores brought in $105 million for a 11.6% drop. Luckily, its supply chain segment jumped 6.05% to $467.58 million. The company\u2019s supply chain segment involves the operation of 19 regional dough manufacturing centers and food supply chain centers in the United States.\n\nThe main issue investors had with Dominos\u2019 second-quarter performance was with its decelerating comp sales. As previously mentioned, US stores comp sales popped 3% but were down from the 6.9% gain in Q2 2018. And International stores climbed 2.4% but lagged behind the 4% gain made a year ago.\n\nCompany Outlook\n\nOur Zacks consensus estimates call for Domino\u2019s to see a 5.13% hike in earnings to $2.05 per share and for sales to come in at $819.4 million for a 4.25% gain. US company owned stores are projected to slip 14.4% to $101.45 million. Supply chain is forecasted to bring in $478.21 million for a 7.44% climb.\n\nUS stores comp sales are estimated to pop 2.7%, which would be below the 6.3% gain made in Q3 2018. US franchise same store sales are forecasted to grow 2.87% and lag behind the 6.4% gain made in the year-ago period.\n\nFull-year Fiscal 2019 estimates call for Dominos\u2019 bottom line to grow 11.76% to $9.41 per share and for its top line to see a 5% jump to $3.6 billion.\n\nDomino\u2019s is likely to continue pushing ahead with its aggressive store expansion plans as it works to rejuvenate its comp sales through menu additions and new features to its mobile ordering platform. Domino\u2019s sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a Style Score of A in Growth.\n\nJust Released: Zacks\u2019 7 Best Stocks for Today\n\n\n\nExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of +24.6% per year.\n\n\n\nThese 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout.\n\n\n\nSee these time-sensitive tickers now >>\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
