By making this clear, the Fed would increase President Trump\u2019s stake in that downside risk. As a result, with more at stake, the president might be more attentive to the risks the trade war posed to the U.S. economy,\u201d Dudley wrote.\n\nEconomists and the Fed community had reacted with astonishment to Dudley\u2019s initial essay, which also argued the Fed consider the president\u2019s bid for re-election in its interest-rate decision-making.\n\nThe Fed quickly distanced itself from the essay, issuing a rare public statement.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who called Dudley a friend, said the former central banker had made a profound mistake with the first piece, and had been disloyal to the central bank.\n\nSee: Lawrence Summers slams Dudley for essay on Trump\n\nRepublicans had reacted with fury to the Dudley essay.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, urged the Senate Banking Committee to hold a hearing on the danger of the Fed meddling in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nDudley said he was just trying to be provocative in his comments about the election. He said he wasn\u2019t suggesting the Fed should take sides in the contest.\n\n\u201cWhat the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do can influence electoral outcomes, which in turn can have consequences for the economy and for monetary policy. But the Fed should never be motivated by political considerations or deliberately set monetary policy with the goal of influencing an election,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has not responded to Dudley\u2019s commentaries. The president recently raised eyebrows for calling Fed Chairman Jerome Powell an \u201cenemy\u201d for his interest-rate decisions, on par with China\u2019s President Xi Yinping.\n\nRead: Trump blasts Powell and Xi as \u2018enemies\u2019\n\nStocks were broadly higher Wednesday on hopes that political tensions in Hong Kong may ease.
