In a statement, the Army says that the material is \u201cideal for absorbing the impact of bullets and other projectiles.\u201d\n\nARMY BUILDING NEW 'AMBIDEXTROUS' MULTI-PURPOSE GRENADE\n\nThe research, which is funded by the Army Research Office (ARO), is published in the journal ACS Applied Polymer Materials.\n\n\"The material is stiff, strong and tough,\" said Shenqiang Ren, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Buffalo University and the paper's lead author, in the statement. \"It could be applicable to vests, helmets and other types of body armor, as well as protective armor for ships, helicopters and other vehicles.\"\n\nRen is also a member of the University at Buffalo's RENEW (Research and Education in eNergy, Environment and Water) Institute.\n\nMARINES 3D-PRINT CONCRETE BRIDGE IN 14 HOURS\n\nMost of the material used is a \u201csouped-up version of polyethylene,\u201d according to the Army. This ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, or UHMWPE, is used for the likes of artificial hips and guitar picks.\n\nResearchers have studied the structure of mother of pearl, which is created by mollusks who arrange a form of calcium carbonate into something that \u201cresembles interlocking bricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike mother of pearl, the researchers designed the material to have an extremely tough outer shell with a more flexible inner backing that's capable of deforming and absorbing projectiles,\u201d the Army said in its statement.\n\nAIR FORCE BASE PRODUCES FIRST CERTIFIED 3D-PRINTED AIRCRAFT PARTS\n\n\"In contrast to steel or ceramic armor, UHMWPE could also be easier to cast or mold into complex shapes, providing versatile protection for soldiers, vehicles, and other Army assets,\u201d said Evan Runnerstrom, Ph.D., program manager, materials design at ARO, in the statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSilica nanoparticles have also been used to potentially create even stronger armor.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Could pearls help save a soldier\u2019s life?", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/SoldierRifle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
