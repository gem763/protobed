Martin Center for Academic Renewal", "language": "en", "text": "A recent cascade of investigative reporting on the shady business dealings of Jerry Falwell Jr. has raised some troubling questions about the controversial evangelical figure and his vision for Liberty University, the conservative Christian institution he has led for more than a decade.\n\nReports from Politico and Reuters, with university staff and administrators as sources, allege that Falwell has repeatedly used university assets to enrich family and friends\u2014and created a campus culture of fear where he holds unbridled authority.\n\nWhile Liberty has long been presented as an alternative to mainstream liberal academia, the university offers a useful case study in how higher education institutions that pursue unique missions can also be susceptible to unique governance pitfalls.\n\nWhen the late Jerry Falwell Sr. founded Liberty University in 1971, he laid out a vision that was markedly different from those of other Bible colleges and private schools. The university website features this quote from Falwell:\n\nFrom the beginning, the goal was not to create another Bible college. The vision was to create academic excellence, world-class facilities, NCAA Division I Athletics, and student activities, and to provide it all with a distinctively Christian environment.\n\nFalwell\u2019s central role in forming the Moral Majority\u2014which mobilized large groups of conservative religious voters for decades\u2014has always featured Liberty as an essential piece of that mission. He wanted to build an institution that could compete with the programs of other large university systems while also producing future generations of reliably pro-life, traditional values evangelicals who would influence communities across the nation.\n\nAs the university grew steadily throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s, Falwell was pushing to expand the scale of Liberty rather than maintaining a small Christian liberal arts college. Additionally, Falwell\u2019s public profile as a close confidant of U.S. presidents and a leading evangelical figure put Liberty in the sights of many young Christians who hoped to get into places of local and national influence.\n\nThough supporters and detractors differ on Liberty\u2019s benefits, it is indisputable that the university has succeeded in building its national influence.\n\nAfter his death in 2007, Falwell\u2019s son, Jerry Falwell Jr, assumed power at Liberty and ushered in a new era for the university.\n\nDuring his tenure, Falwell has dramatically grown university assets\u2014from $259 million in 2007 to more than $3 billion by 2018. But as this financial growth occurred, Politico reports that Falwell also significantly consolidated power over university administration in a way that has led many who work closely with him to question his leadership.\n\nCritics argue that Falwell has created a culture of fear where people are unable to speak out. They point to examples such as how faculty outside of the law school cannot obtain tenure and the routine use of non-disclosure agreements that stop current and former staff and board members from discussing sensitive matters around Falwell\u2019s leadership.\n\nDocumented incidents of retaliatory firings when staff criticize university leadership make this fear a legitimate reality.\n\nStudents live under scrutiny and fear along with the staff. Other stories from students and alumni detail his micro-management of the campus newspaper\u2014claiming that he reserves the right to edit or reject any columns of which he disapproves. The school newspaper isn\u2019t even student-run anymore. Other accounts note incidents like the university\u2019s past \u201cderecognition\u201d of Campus Democrats, Falwell\u2019s forced removal of an anti-Trump pastor, and when campus shut down a student booth where libertarian students tried to discuss legalizing marijuana.\n\nOther highlights of malfeasance include making loans to friends contrary to the school\u2019s financial interests, signing massive construction contracts with personal associates, and investing in real estate that\u2019s owned by friends and family. The reports from Politico and Reuters also question Liberty-sponsored political activity\u2014like selling merchandise that features both the Liberty and Trump brand\u2014as potential violations of IRS rules governing nonprofits.\n\nIn fact, many of the shady financial practices documented in those reports are legally questionable actions for nonprofits, according to University of Pittsburgh law professor Phillip Hackney, who specializes in tax law.\n\nSince faculty have little job security and students are limited in their ability to voice their dissent, it\u2019s unlikely anyone on campus will stand up to Falwell.\n\nWhat makes all these accounts more concerning is that Liberty receives a majority of its revenues\u2014more than $770 million annually\u2014from government sources. In contrast to other schools like Hillsdale College or Grove City College, which don\u2019t accept federal funds, students pay for Liberty with federal aid and federal loans. While the university shouldn\u2019t have to compromise on its mission in order to receive these dollars, it is deeply troubling when taxpayer money goes toward supporting business ventures that have no academic mission.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to verify the true extent to which all these problematic practices are a divergence from those used under the leadership of Jerry Falwell Sr., the recent reports suggest that Falwell Jr. has significantly changed Liberty\u2019s trajectory since his father\u2019s death.\n\nFalwell\u2019s response has been to boast of Liberty\u2019s tremendous financial success and growing public influence under his leadership. But whether those successes are truly in keeping with the original mission of the university is the key question. While it\u2019s true that the goal for Liberty was always to become a large university with far-reaching influence, it\u2019s hard to see how things like personal profiteering at the expense of taxpayers and students\u2014and stifling the independence of staff, faculty, and students\u2014advance this goal.\n\nTo be clear, the problem with Liberty\u2019s governance isn\u2019t endemic to the mission itself. It\u2019s easy to imagine an alternative timeline where Jerry Falwell Sr.\u2019s successor avoids all these pitfalls. In fact, under this alternative trajectory, the university mission would have been better served.\n\nBut there are far too few checks on Falwell\u2019s power. His own board of trustees can face serious consequences when they don\u2019t fall in line. Longtime trustee Mark DeMoss was ousted from his role on the board when he disagreed with Falwell\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016. Since Politico released its report, Falwell has responded by calling for an FBI investigation into former board members for criminally conspiring against him.\n\nSince faculty have little job security and students are limited in their ability to voice their dissent, it\u2019s unlikely anyone on campus will stand up to Falwell. He simply isn\u2019t being held accountable by a governance model that placed too much power in the hands of one person.\n\nSchools struggling with their own governance problems should keep Liberty in mind when they manage their leadership. Liberty\u2019s leaders are in a difficult situation because they\u2019ve prioritized growth and the school\u2019s national reputation over checks on the power accumulated by its president. The campus community has placed too much faith in a single leader, to the point where they\u2019ve been unwilling or unable to speak out when the balance of power becomes too lopsided.\n\nReforming Liberty doesn\u2019t mean compromising its mission. Nobody is demanding that Liberty become a Christian liberal arts school in the mold of Wheaton College or Hillsdale, or a carbon copy of a secular state school. In fact, Liberty is uniquely positioned as a popular university that could be a bona fide alternative to the overwhelmingly progressive status quo in academia.\n\nThere are many factors coming together to make Liberty\u2019s governance problems unique. The distinct religious and political vision, the influence over the community in which it resides and the leadership style of the man at the helm all combine to form a distinct challenge. If the university is going to change course and live up to its own standards, the campus dissenters need to make a bold move and speak truth to power.\n\nChristian Barnard is a Young Voices contributor and an education policy analyst at the Reason Foundation.
