The duo claimed that Swift stole their lyrics and used them in her famous hit single \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nThe lyrics in question are, \u201cPlayers gonna play, play, play, play, play, and haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in February 2018 appeared to side with Swift\u2019s lawyers who claimed that copyright protection would not cover the vague lyrics because \u201cit would impermissibly monopolize the idea that players will play and haters will hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claim to being the only ones in the world who can refer to players playing and haters hating is frivolous\u2026 Providing a copyright monopoly in the phrase would prevent others from sharing the idea that players play and haters hate,\u201d her lawyer said.\n\nIn 2018, the feeral judge, according to the Hollywood Reporter, said, \"combining two truisms about playas and haters, both well-worn notions as of 2001, is simply not enough,\" concluding, \"In sum, the lyrics at issue \u2014 the only thing that Plaintiffs allege Defendants copied \u2014 are too brief, unoriginal, and uncreative to warrant protection under the Copyright Act.\"\n\nThe case will be back in court at a later time, THR reported.", "description": "The Ninth Circuit of Appeals on Monday revived a copyright lawsuit focused on the lyrics of \u201cShake it Off,\u201d which could be Taylor Swift\u2019s most recognizable song.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
