International media exposure also comes with the summit \u2014 putting Trump National Doral Miami on televisions and websites around the world.\n\nResorts that have hosted the summit of world leaders, including the Lough Erne resort in Northern Ireland in 2013, have seen increased exposure and improvements in their business for years after the summit. \u201cLough Erne wouldn\u2019t be the place it is today without the PR and the legacy of that event,\u201d William Kirby, the resort\u2019s general manager, told The Washington Post recently. \u201cIt\u2019s the pinnacle of the resort history.\u201d\n\nThat summit boosted the local economy and highlighted the resort on the world stage, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy that, can you?\u201d Kirby said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House appeared to be saying Trump was going to take payments from both foreign governments and the U.S. government \u2014 but he believed that was fine, as long as he did not set out to make a profit. Typically, the U.S. government pays the bulk of costs for hosting a summit, but foreign countries pay for their own rooms.\n\nGrisham also said the government might set up a host committee for the event, which could raise private donations. In that case, it would give private donors a chance to pay the president\u2019s company \u2014 saving taxpayers money, perhaps, but creating new questions about conflicts of interest.\n\nGrisham referred questions about summit pricing and costs to the State Department, which did not provide any immediate explanation. The Trump Organization did not respond to questions about the event Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced it would hold the 2020 summit at Doral, a resort near Miami International Airport that Trump bought in 2012. The resort is a keystone of Trump\u2019s finances, but it has been in sharp decline recently: From 2015 to 2017, the resort\u2019s net operating income fell 69 percent.\n\nThe summit is scheduled for June, which is typically one of the resort\u2019s slowest months with less than 40 percent of rooms occupied, and will likely fill the hotel with hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision brought a flood of criticism Friday from Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), one of more than 200 Democrats who are suing Trump for past alleged violations of the foreign emoluments clause.\n\nAD\n\nBlumenthal said they would add the Doral decision to their next legal filing, since it shows Trump is accelerating his efforts to gain foreign government business.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHere he is, in plain sight, saying in effect, \u2018I\u2019m just going to make your case for you,\u2019 \u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nHouse Democrats also planned to introduce a resolution next week opposing Trump\u2019s decision to hold the summit at Doral and \u201crejecting his practice of accepting foreign government Emoluments without obtaining Congress\u2019 affirmative consent.\u201d\n\nThe House Rules Committee was expected to vote Tuesday whether to send the resolution to the floor.\n\n\u201cThe Oval Office is not a subsidiary of the Trump organization,\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe president takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve the American people, not enrich himself. But time and time again, the president has demonstrated that the Constitution means nothing to him. This House is standing up to say enough is enough.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate on Friday also introduced versions of a bill to prohibit funding the G-7 summit at Trump\u2019s Doral resort, while requiring the White House to turn over documents related to the decision to choose Doral as the summit venue. The House version was called the Trump\u2019s Heist Undermines the G-7 (THUG) Act.\n\nThere was a trickle of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why at this moment they had to do that,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said on CNN, calling the move \u201cunnecessary\u201d and adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Kinzinger said he had defended Trump on the controversy of allowing Department of Defense crews to stay at a Trump property in Scotland but said, \u201cThis is something that feels a little different.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), said: \u201cIn the law, there\u2019s a canon that says, \u2018Avoid the appearance of impropriety.\u2019 I think that that would be better if he would not use his hotel for this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Brussels, where European leaders were gathered for meetings, European Council President Donald Tusk, an invitee to past G-7 summits, said it was not appropriate to spend public funds at Trump\u2019s resort. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said.\n\nTusk is expected to step down from his role next month, but for the past five years he has been a participant in the Group of Seven summit. His successor, current Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, will make the final decision about whether and how to participate in the summit.\n\nAD\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, also asked by The Post at a news conference whether she was ready to spend German tax money on Trump\u2019s private business, said, \u201cThis is a decision taken by the American president. I haven\u2019t had time to deal with this yet. We will take a close look at his invitation, and my intention is to attend the summit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlready, Trump\u2019s decision is the subject of questions in Germany, where the leader of a far-left opposition party asked Friday whether the money should be channeled to Trump\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cHeads of state and government aren\u2019t in favor of financing his business,\u201d Left Party head Bernd Riexinger told Agence France-Presse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump is mixing private and state interests with his decision to place heads of state and government in one of his hotels,\u201d he said. \u201cThis behavior is harmful for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe budget for the 2013 summit in Northern Ireland \u2014 most of it paid for by Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s British government \u2014 was reportedly more than $100 million.\n\nThe 2018 summit, held at the Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu north of Quebec City in Canada, provided a tourist boost for the region, according to an official in the regional tourist authority.\n\nAD\n\nHotel occupancy for June 2018, the month of the summit, got a nearly 20 percent bump over the prior June, pushing the region to its first year of more than 50 percent hotel occupancy.\n\n\u201cI cannot guarantee it\u2019s completely because of the summit, but it really helped because April to June are not the high season. Those months were definitely good,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n\u201cWhat we can say is that it\u2019s been good for visibility for the region for sure,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for the tourism performance.\u201d\n\nThe White House has said the Doral was clearly the best of the 12 possible sites it vetted for the event, but it has declined to name the other 11 sites. The one detail given about other sites was that one was so high-altitude that the planners thought they might have to provide oxygen tanks for participants.\n\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, that site was eliminated,\u201d Grisham said.", "description": "For the president, the potential benefits of awarding himself the summit include international media exposure \u2014 putting Trump Doral on televisions around the world.", "authors": ["David A.
