Some Democrats said Trump\u2019s latest comments had generated another potential article of impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump spoke to reporters at the White House, Kurt D. Volker, who resigned last week as Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine, was being interviewed behind closed doors in front of three House committees. Volker was among the officials mentioned by name in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nAD\n\nIn a television interview that aired earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused her Republican colleagues of being loyal to Trump and not the Constitution.\n\n\u25cfTrump involved Vice President Pence in efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader, though officials say that Pence was unaware of allegations in the whistleblower complaint\n\n\u25cfOdd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the \u201crough transcript\u201d of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani consulted on Ukraine with imprisoned Paul Manafort via a lawyer\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky | Related coverage and analysis of the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\n5:45 p.m.: Trump reportedly ordered U.S. ambassador to Ukraine replaced over complaints she was obstructing Biden investigation\n\nAD\n\nTrump ordered the removal of U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from her post in Kiev after hearing concerns from Giuliani and former Texas congressman Pete Sessions, among others, according to a senior administration official, who confirmed the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani informed the president that he thought Yovanovitch was blocking his investigation into Biden and that she was against Trump. Sessions, in 2018 when he was still in office, reportedly asked for her removal because he\u2019d heard she had a bias against Trump.\n\nTrump said that he wanted it done quickly, the senior administration official said. Yovanovitch, who Trump disparaged on his call with the Ukrainian president in July, was called home before her post ended in the spring.\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly criticized the ambassador and the embassy to The Post and others. He told the Journal, which first broke the story, that he had seen Yovanovitch \u201cas an obstacle\u201d in his pursuit for information about Biden from Ukrainians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump says \u2018there wasn\u2019t ANYTHING said wrong\u2019 in his Ukraine call, decries \u2018ELECTION INTERFERENCE!\u2019\n\nIn tweets late Thursday afternoon, Trump yet again defended his call with Zelensky, accusing Democrats of a \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t ANYTHING said wrong in my conversation with the Ukrainian President,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a Democrat Scam!\u201d\n\nHe also sent a two-word tweet \u2014 \u201cELECTION INTERFERENCE!\u201d \u2014 that drew derision from some Democrats, who questioned whether the president was referring to allegations against his political opponents or himself.\n\n\u201cHate when I tweet the thing I\u2019m Googling,\u201d quipped Tommy Vietor, \u201cPod Save America\u201d co-host and a national security spokesman under President Barack Obama.\n\nAD\n\n5:20 p.m.: Kamala Harris says she\u2019s calling on White House to release calls between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\nAD\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a 2020 presidential candidate, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that she will ask the White House to \u201crelease whatever transcripts, recording, notes there are about Donald Trump\u2019s previous conversations with Xi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now need to know what he\u2019s said in private conversations because we obviously know what he\u2019s saying in public,\u201d Harris said, responding to a question about Trump\u2019s call for China to also investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cThe president of the [U.S.] should not be in the business of working with foreign leaders against our democracy,\u201d she said, according to a tweet by Tapper.\n\nAD\n\n5 p.m.: Pentagon grapples with Ukraine military aid, prepares to collect information for impeachment inquiry\n\nThe Pentagon is preparing to proactively collect documents related to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, with its chief legal officer issuing guidance to defense officials about what to save, the Pentagon said Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nChief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said that \u201cin keeping with past practice on matters of importance,\u201d General Counsel Paul C. Ney Jr.\u2019s office issued a memo to other defense officials saying that they should provide him with any pertinent documents for cataloguing and review.\n\nThe direction comes as the Pentagon grapples with its own understanding of alleged efforts by Trump and other members of his administration to seek information about Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nIn a separate news briefing, the top U.S. military commander in Europe declined Thursday to say whether he inquired about why U.S. aid to Ukraine was held up, a key issue in the impeachment inquiry, and his spokeswoman cited politics as the reason.\n\nTod Wolters, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said that he hasn\u2019t had any conversations with allies and partners about the Ukrainian aid issue.\n\nAD\n\nWolters, who took over as chief of European Command about five months ago, said he sees countering Russia\u2019s influence in Europe as a top priority. It makes sense for more Javelin missiles to be sent to Ukraine, he said, to allow Ukrainian soldiers to \u201cprotect their own turf.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the State Department announced that it has approved the sale of 150 more Javelin missiles to Ukraine for up to $39.2 million and notified Congress. The Ukrainian president brought up his desire to purchase the missiles during the now-infamous July 25 phone call with Trump.\n\n\u2014 Dan Lamothe\n\n4:30 p.m.: IRS whistleblower said to report that Treasury political appointee might have tried to interfere in audit of Trump or Pence\n\nAn Internal Revenue Service official has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president or vice president\u2019s tax returns, according to multiple people familiar with the document.\n\nAD\n\nTrump administration officials dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as flimsy because it is based on conversations with other government officials. But congressional Democrats were alarmed by the complaint, now circulating on Capitol Hill, and flagged it to a federal judge. They are also discussing whether to make it public.\n\nThe details of the IRS complaint follow news of a separate, explosive whistleblower complaint filed in August by a member of the intelligence community. That complaint revealed Trump\u2019s request to the Ukrainian president for an investigation of Biden and his son, which has spurred an impeachment probe on Capitol Hill.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Jeff Stein, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey\n\n4:05 p.m.: Trump bizarrely suggests Big Pharma is pushing his impeachment\n\nTrump accused pharmaceutical companies of being behind the House Democrats\u2019 push for impeachment because of his administration\u2019s work to lower drug prices.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the hoax didn\u2019t come a little bit from some of the people that we\u2019re taking on,\u201d Trump said during an event on Medicare in Florida. \u201cThey\u2019re very powerful, they spend a lot of money, spend I think more money than any other group in the world actually in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was from some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on,\u201d he continued.\n\nTrump did not provide any evidence for his claim.\n\nWhen asked about what Trump said, Holly Campbell, spokeswoman for PhRMA, said, \u201cNot to be so frank, but it is ridiculous you are asking me about it. Of course we are not.\u201d\n\n3:45 p.m.: Pelosi swats down McCarthy\u2019s call to cease impeachment inquiry\n\nPelosi began a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) telling him that as members of Congress \u201cwe take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and thus that is what the House is doing with its impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cAs you know, our Founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cI received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections. We hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nPelosi was responding to a letter Thursday morning from McCarthy asking that she suspend the inquiry until she fully explained how she intended the proceedings to go. McCarthy has complained that Pelosi decided to launch the probe without input from Republicans.\n\n3 p.m.: Letter shows GOP senators in 2016 supported Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Ukrainian prosecutor\n\nA bipartisan letter dated Feb. 12, 2016, signed by Republican Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Ron Johnson (Wis.), and Mark Kirk (Ill.) and sent to Ukraine\u2019s then-president Petro Poroshenko, asks him to make changes in the office of the top prosecutor.\n\nThe letter, first unearthed by CNN, shows that then-vice president Joe Biden was not alone in wanting Ukraine to oust its prosecutor over concerns about the corruption pervasive in the country.\n\nThe senators wrote to the Ukrainian president that they \u201curge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General\u2019s office and judiciary.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that Biden wanted the prosecutor ousted because he\u2019d investigated a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. There has been no evidence found to support this accusation, and the letter shows that concerns about the prosecutor were widespread and bipartisan.\n\nNotably, since it was revealed that Trump asked the Ukrainian president for help getting information about Biden and his son, Johnson has said he would consider opening a congressional investigation into Biden\u2019s engagements with Ukraine.\n\n2:50 p.m.: Pascrell says Virginia, District bar associations should sanction Barr\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) sent letters Thursday to the District of Columbia and Virginia bar associations calling for sanctions on Attorney General William P. Barr, accusing Barr of having \u201crepeatedly violated\u201d both bodies\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\n\u201cMr. Barr\u2019s pattern of lying and his corruption of the rule of law in America in service of one man is a betrayal of Attorney General Robert Kennedy\u2019s warnings and unprecedented in our national life,\u201d Pascrell said in the letters. \u201cIn carrying out that perversion, Mr. Barr has clearly violated [your] Rules of Professional Conduct he swore to uphold and should face the severest sanction your body can mete out: revocation of his law licensure.\u201d\n\n2:15 p.m.: Pence says Americans \u2018have right to know\u2019 about Biden and his son\n\nPence defended Trump when he was asked to respond to the president calling for China to investigate Biden and his family.\n\n\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president in the last administration,\u201d Pence said during an event in Arizona. \u201cThat\u2019s about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported Wednesday that Trump had used Pence on several occasions to put pressure on Ukraine in an attempt to receive information about Biden.\n\n2 p.m.: Trump mockingly admonishes supporter who yells, \u2018Lock her up.\u2019\n\nOn the same day that Trump invited another foreign country to help him gather information on Biden, the president invited cheers for a man who yelled, \u201cLock her up.\u201d\n\nTrump was speaking at an official government event ostensibly on Medicare, but it felt more like a political rally, with Trump going after his normal targets.\n\nWhen a supporter yelled \u201clock her up\u201d \u2014 the chant that originated in 2016 about Hillary Clinton \u2014 Trump smiled. Then he said the news media was going to attack him for smiling, so he invited the person who said it to stand.\n\nThe man waved his hand as the crowd cheered him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m admonishing you,\u201d Trump said sarcastically as the crowd laughed. \u201cNow the press can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t admonish.\u201d\n\nLater in his speech, when the crowd started chanting \u201cfour more years,\u201d Trump encouraged them to drive the media \u201ccrazy\u201d by saying, \u201ceight more years or 12 more years. Sixteen would do it \u2014 you\u2019d really drive them into the loony bin. And that\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly.\u201d\n\n1:10 p.m.: FEC chair renews warning for candidates not to accept foreign election help\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks on China and Ukraine grabbed the attention of Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub, who on Thursday retweeted a statement she had made in June warning candidates not to accept help from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cIs this thing on?\u201d Weintraub tweeted, along with a microphone emoji.\n\nWeintraub, a Democrat, had put out the statement in June, 24 hours after Trump told ABC News that he would not necessarily report to law enforcement if a foreign national offered him information on a political opponent.\n\n\u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office,\u201d Weintraub wrote at the time. \u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept.\u201d\n\n1:05 p.m.: Trump shares McCarthy\u2019s call to suspend impeachment inquiry\n\nAfter landing in Florida for an event on Medicare, Trump took to Twitter to share a letter from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) asking Pelosi to suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answers several questions about the process.\n\n\u201cLeader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThe Do Nothing Dems don\u2019t have a chance!\u201d\n\n12:45 p.m.: Trump is counting on Republicans to look the other way, Amash says\n\nRep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a vocal Trump critic who left the Republican Party in July, said Thursday that Trump is counting on members of his party to turn a blind eye to his recent actions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s openly challenging our system of checks and balances,\u201d Amash said of Trump in a tweet. \u201cIn plain sight, he\u2019s using the powers of his public office for personal gain and counting on Republicans in Congress to look the other way.\u201d\n\nBefore becoming an independent, Amash was the only Republican in Congress to have accused Trump of impeachable acts. He has not ruled out a 2020 presidential bid.\n\n12:20 p.m.: McCarthy calls on Pelosi to suspend impeachment inquiry\n\nAs Democrats erupted over Trump\u2019s latest comments, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called on Pelosi to suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answers questions about the process.\n\nIn a letter, McCarthy contended that Pelosi had \u201cgiven no clear indication\u201d as to whether the inquiry will follow historical precedents or offer due process to Trump.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there have been only three prior instances in our nation\u2019s history when the full House has moved to formally investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of a sitting President,\u201d McCarthy wrote. \u201cI should hope that if such an extraordinary step were to be contemplated a fourth time it would be conducted with an eye toward fairness, objectivity and impartiality.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy listed 10 procedural questions, including whether Republicans would have \u201cco-equal subpoena power\u201d and whether Trump\u2019s counsel would have the right to present evidence.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Some Democrats say Trump \u2018just created another article of impeachment\u2019\n\nAs the dust settled on Trump\u2019s South Lawn remarks, some House Democrats said his latest comments had generated another potential article of impeachment.\n\nMany took to Twitter to voice disbelief at Trump\u2019s call for China and Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens.\n\n\u201c@POTUS just created another article of impeachment by doing in public what he did in private,\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) tweeted. \u201cThis time enlisting China to interfere in the 2020 election on behalf of his campaign. His disregard for the law is stunning. So much for his oath of office.\u201d\n\nRep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) referenced Trump\u2019s remark during the 2016 campaign that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t shoot someone on Fifth Avenue. He shot himself in the foot on the White House South Lawn,\u201d tweeted Yarmuth, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cShameful. Illegal. Dangerous.\u201d\n\nTrump says Hunter Biden \u2018walks out of China with $1.5 billion.\u2019 Biden\u2019s lawyer said that\u2019s not true.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Hillary Clinton weighs in\n\nHillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, took aim at the Republican who defeated her in an early afternoon tweet.\n\n\u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\u201d Clinton tweeted, referring to Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate Biden and his son.\n\n12:05 p.m.: Cheney ignores Trump comments, seeks to steer focus back to Biden\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican, responded to Trump\u2019s comments by ignoring them \u2014 and attempting to steer the focus back to Biden.\n\n\u201cIf foreign entities attempted to influence US policy by paying Hunter Biden, the American people have a right to know,\u201d Cheney said in a tweet. \u201cQuestion for @SpeakerPelosi and @RepAdamSchiff \u2014 why do you think the Ukrainians and Chinese were paying Hunter Biden?\u201d\n\nOther Republicans continued to lash out at Schiff.\n\n\u201cLast week, @RepAdamSchiff did what he does best; mislead the American people,\u201d Rep. Earl L. \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter (R-Ga.) tweeted, adding that he\u2019s a \u201cproud co-sponsor\u201d of a resolution \u201ccensuring him for his careless & deceitful remarks at last week\u2019s impeachment hearing.\u201d\n\n11:55 a.m.: Biden, other Democratic White House hopefuls pounce on Trump\u2019s comments\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates, including Biden, pounced on Trump\u2019s call for an investigation by China, calling it a further abuse of power.\n\n\u201cWith his administration in free-fall, Donald Trump is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\u201d Biden campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.\n\nSeveral other candidates took to Twitter.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: This is a threat. It\u2019s an abuse of power. And it\u2019s an impeachable offense,\u201d tweeted former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.).\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, pledged that Congress would hold Trump accountable.\n\n\u201cMr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won\u2019t protect you from the truth,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cJoe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you\u2019ll ever have. You violate your oath and undermine American values when you urge foreign nations to do your dirty work. We will hold you accountable.\u201d\n\n11:45 a.m.: Schiff says Trump \u2018cannot use the power of his office to pressure foreign leaders\u2019 on investigations\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about China and Ukraine on Thursday prompted alarm among congressional Democrats, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who argued that the president was now openly inviting foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThe President cannot use the power of his office to pressure foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents,\u201d Schiff said in a tweet. \u201cHis rant this morning reinforces the urgency of our work. America is a Republic, if we can keep it.\u201d\n\nOther House Democrats followed suit in voicing concern at the president\u2019s statements.\n\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d Pascrell said in a tweet in which he shared video of Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cMy republican colleagues can lie and obfuscate all they want but their leader is now publicly calling on foreign governments to meddle in our elections.\u201d\n\nAnother New Jersey Democrat, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., voiced similar sentiments. \u201cTrump is now openly calling for foreign interference in our elections in a calculated effort to normalize his corruption,\u201d Pallone tweeted. \u201cThis alone is impeachable. House Democrats will continue to investigate this president\u2019s abuse of power.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) addressed Trump, tweeting, \u201cI know this is a new concept for you, but in America, voters elect the president\u2014not foreign countries.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.) tweeted: \u201cIn democracies, presidents don\u2019t dictate investigations into political rivals.\u201d\n\n11:15 a.m.: Intelligence community\u2019s top lawyer offers assurances on not disclosing identity\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s top lawyer has assured the whistleblower\u2019s legal team that \u201cwe will strenuously object to any attempts to disclose your client\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nThat comes as Trump has demanded for days to meet the anonymous U.S. intelligence officer who brought the complaint against him.\n\nIn a Friday letter to the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers obtained by The Washington Post, Office of the Director of National Intelligence General Counsel Jason Klitenic said, \u201cPlease know that we are coordinating with others to take protective measures designed to ensure your client\u2019s safety and security.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up letter Monday to the whistleblower\u2019s lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, Klitenic reiterated that the protections apply not only to disclosures the whistleblower made to the intelligence community inspector general, but also to disclosures to Congress, as long as they are made to \u201ccleared individuals in a secure facility.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe applaud the DNI\u2019s support for protecting this and all other whistleblowers,\u201d said Mark Zaid, another member of the legal team. \u201cThese letters reflect the sentiments of someone committed to the rule of law rather than politics.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ellen Nakashima\n\n10:30 a.m.: Trump calls for China to investigate the Bidens\n\nTrump suggested Thursday that another foreign country should investigate Biden and his son Hunter, even though House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against him over his request that the Ukrainian president do the same.\n\nBiden is a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s allegations regarding Hunter Biden and China center on him joining the board of an investment firm whose partners included Chinese entities while his father was vice president. The president and his allies have provided no evidence to back up their claims of wrongdoing.\n\nFact Checker: Trump\u2019s false claims about Hunter Biden\u2019s China dealings\n\nTrump made his comments to reporters as he prepared to depart the White House.\n\nAsked what he wanted from Zelensky, Trump said, \u201cI would think if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had requested Chinese President Xi Jinping to help investigate the Bidens, Trump replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about, because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.\u201d\n\nTrump also told reporters he had fired former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch because he \u201cheard very bad things about her.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from her position in Ukraine this year amid political attacks by conservative media and other allies of Trump, including Giuliani, who targeted her with unsubstantiated accusations and argued that she \u201cshould be part of the investigation as part of the collusion.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch is scheduled to appear before three House committees on Oct. 11 as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n9:30 a.m. Giuliani accuses Democrats of running a \u2018Star Chamber\u2019\n\nAs Volker was scheduled to begin his deposition, Giuliani took to Twitter to accuse the Democratic-led committees of conducting a \u201cStar Chamber\u201d and shared a text exchange with Volker.\n\nIn his tweet, Giuliani echoed complaints of Republican lawmakers about their more limited role in the proceedings.\n\n\u201cThis is a Star Chamber, illicit and part of their conspiracy to violate constitutional rights condoned by their media lamb dogs,\u201d Giuliani added. \u201cKurt did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nHe included a text exchange with Volker in which Volker asked Giuliani if he were \u201cback stateside\u201d and suggested they \u201cget together.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent tweets, Giuliani shared other text messages about arranging meetings.\n\nOn Thursday, the committees are expected to examine Volker\u2019s role in facilitating contacts between Giuliani and officials of the Ukrainian government in the summer.\n\n9:15 a.m.: Former Ukraine envoy arrives on Capitol Hill for a deposition behind closed doors\n\nVolker is scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill at 9:30 a.m. to the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nHe resigned Friday from his position as U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, and has agreed to testify before the three congressional committees on Thursday despite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s refusal to make current State Department officials available to lawmakers.\n\nVolker tendered his resignation to Pompeo on Friday, within hours of an announcement that the veteran diplomat was among State Department officials who would be compelled to testify.\n\nVolker, who heads the McCain Institute at Arizona State University, had held the Ukraine job part time for the past two years.\n\nHe worked for months to facilitate a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, a young anti-corruption reformer elected in April. That meeting may have been held up as part of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign. The two met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last week.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Trump takes renewed aim at Schiff, highlights prankster episode\n\nTrump renewed his attacks Thursday on Schiff, calling him a \u201clowlife\u201d in a tweet that also shared a Breitbart report about pranksters once offering Schiff nude photos of Trump.\n\n\u201cSchiff is a lowlife who should resign (at least!),\u201d Trump said in his tweet.\n\nIn 2018, the Atlantic reported that two Russian pranksters posing as members of Ukraine\u2019s parliament called Schiff claiming to have \u201cpictures of naked Trump\u201d from a purported encounter with a Russian woman, among other information.\n\nSchiff\u2019s staff told the Atlantic in a statement that they had alerted law enforcement before and after the call that the claim was \u201cprobably bogus.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, some House Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), have sought to focus renewed attention on the episode, arguing that Schiff is a hypocrite for criticizing Trump for seeking dirt on a political opponent.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, also referred to the episode during a hearing last week.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Pelosi says Republicans are loyal to Trump, not the Constitution\n\nPelosi accused Republicans of being loyal to Trump and not the Constitution during a television interview that aired Thursday in which she discussed the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, she derided her GOP colleagues for attacks on the inquiry that she launched last week.\n\n\u201cWhen I took the oath of office to support and defend the Constitution, as my colleagues have done as well, I did not say I will do this as long as the Republicans can understand the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cSo the fact that their loyalty is to Trump and not to the Constitution is not going to slow down or impair our ability to keep the republic.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Pelosi also pushed back on a Republican argument that Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky was not problematic because there was no explicit \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between providing U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigating the Bidens.\n\nTrump\u2019s call in which he asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d came shortly after the Trump administration suspended congressionally approved aid.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Pelosi said of a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut second of all, there is a quid pro quo if you\u2019re only a couple of days apart in granting or withholding and then asking for a favor to create dirt on your political opponent,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe president did engage in the leverage of our national security, legislation that was passed by the House and the Senate, in the interest of our national security to give military assistance to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: White House officials weigh appeal to Democrats in GOP districts to stop impeachment of Trump\n\nWhite House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats\u2019 2018 election promises to work with the president \u2014 accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey\n\n6:45 a.m.: Trump shares Franklin Graham\u2019s prayer for Democrats\n\nAmid a spate of morning tweets and retweets, Trump shared an account of evangelist Franklin Graham praying that God would steer Democrats away from impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe socialist Democrats\u2019 message to the United States of America is: 1. We\u2019re going to take your guns, and 2. We\u2019re going to impeach your president,\u201d Graham wrote Tuesday in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cPray that God would change the hearts of Democratic leaders in Washington and that they would see the dangerous road that we\u2019re on,\u201d he added.\n\n6:35 a.m.: Wednesday\u2019s White House news conference generates ridicule and some concern in Finland\n\nWednesday\u2019s roller coaster news conference with Trump and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 elicited ridicule and some concern in Finland, where many celebrated their leader on Thursday for enduring with dignity what they largely described as a Trump monologue.\n\nComing from a nation that ranks second on the World Press Freedom Index \u2014 compared to the United States, which ranks 48th \u2014 stunned Finnish reporters described to their readers back home a \u201ccircus\u201d and parallel reality in the White House.\n\nHas anyone checked in on the president of Finland?\u2019: Trump\u2019s \u2018off the rails\u2019 performance turned a foreign leader into a meme\n\nFinnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet offered a blunt summary of the meeting: \u201cNiinisto\u2019s visit was overshadowed by Circus Trump \u2014 President Niinisto asked Trump to safeguard US democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very typical Trump press conference with a foreign leader. [Trump talks] and the foreign leader is just a prop, who basically watches and tries to keep a straight face,\u201d Jussi Hanhimaki, a Finnish researcher focusing on transatlantic relations, told The Washington Post.\n\nRead more here.\n\n6 a.m.: Biden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019\n\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 Biden struck a defiant tone Wednesday night during a campaign speech in which he ripped Trump\u2019s efforts to smear him and assured supporters that Trump won\u2019t destroy him or his candidacy.\n\nThe top-polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has become inextricably intertwined with the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s behavior, which centers on Trump asking a foreign leader for dirt on Biden\u2019s son.\n\nBiden, who spent four decades in the Senate, has in the past sought to separate Trump and his base from the Republican Party that contains his friends and peers, including many he served with as a senator. But in his remarks here, Biden slammed the GOP and \u201chatchet men\u201d who he said echo Trump\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cHe is repeatedly smearing me and my family. His party fans out to carry the smear,\u201d Biden said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Colby Itkowitz\n\n6 a.m.: Whistleblower drafted complaint \u2018entirely on their own,\u2019 lawyer says\n\nA lawyer for the whistleblower said Wednesday that the whistleblower drafted the complaint \u201centirely on their own\u201d and without input of Congress.\n\nThe statement came after Trump, at a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, accused Schiff, with no evidence, of having helped write the complaint.\n\nTrump made the comment in response to a question about a New York Times report stating that Schiff had learned the outlines of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns days before the individual filed a formal complaint.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower drafted the Complaint entirely on their own,\u201d Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, none of the legal team saw the Complaint until it was publicly released by Congress. To be unequivocally clear, no Member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the Complaint before it was submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said GOP lawmakers are loyal to Trump, not the Constitution, ahead of testimony from a key witness in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dgip5rQWCTPKzW_U_DbKhHgatpc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZPX6OYXFLMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
