Protesters have always called for all of their five demands to be met, including an independent enquiry into policing methods during the protests.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission issued a statement indicating it was appointing a panel of international experts to advise it on its \u201cthematic study on police practices and procedures arising from recent public order events\u201d. It\u2019s early days, but this may prove to be as significant as Lam\u2019s withdrawal of the bill.\n\nFormer Legislative Council member and treasurer of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Sin Chung Kai, has known Carrie Lam for some 40 years, since they were university classmates and he thinks her days are numbered. \u201cShe is neither representing the interests of Hong Kong or Beijing\u201d he says, adding that \u201cstrong political rumours\u201d indicate Beijing is already casting its net for a more socially acceptable replacement.\n\nHer departure combined with the Bill\u2019s official withdrawal, and an independent investigation into police methods, might not meet all of the five demands but it may be enough to take the heat out of the current crisis and buy time. It was always available as a potential political solution but, until today, Beijing has insisted on a typically uncompromising \"comply or die\" approach to dissent in Hong Kong. Very few in the city make confident predictions anymore; even fewer can claim to understand the internal political machinations of the Chinese Communist Party, but economics probably holds the key to the future.\n\nOnce the impact of the protests threatened to damage the commercial interests of the powerful oligopoly which controls the local economy, things started to change quickly. Defacing the Chinese flag and lobbing petrol bombs might be condemned by the tycoons, but a falling Hang Seng Index and stuttering real estate prices proved even more unacceptable. Even Beijing cannot risk disruption to the economy during a testing trade war with the US.\n\nThe struggle for full universal suffrage will continue, of course. Protest, and even violent riots, have long been part of the political scene in Hong Kong. Civil disobedience often presented a challenge for the pre-1997 colonial administrations and has always been an unofficial safety valve within a dysfunctional political system. When activists dent the vested corporate interests though, they touch an Achilles heel.\n\nThe latest news of Lam\u2019s decision to officially withdraw the bill triggered a sharp rise in share prices on the Hang Seng Index. In Hong Kong, that counts as the ultimate approval rating.", "description": "After more than 13 weeks of mass demonstrations, strikes and violent confrontations, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, will finally withdraw her controversial extradition bill which was the catalyst for the widespread civil unrest.
