As India celebrates his 150th birthday, his legacy is getting a second look. (James A. Mills/Associated Press)\n\nIndia is marking the 150th birthday of Mohandas Gandhi, the man known as the father of the nation, and across the country there are exhibits, commemorations, marches, prisoner releases and even a 1,000-foot-long greeting card.\n\nBut the celebrations this week mask a deeper unease. A century and a half after the birth of the revered leader of India\u2019s independence struggle, Gandhi and his legacy are getting an update \u2014 and much of it is not positive.\n\nEven as admiration for Gandhi remains widespread, aspects of his life and philosophy are increasingly a source of controversy. Scholars have highlighted the racist language he used as a young man living in South Africa as well as his defense of India\u2019s caste system.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the political spectrum, India\u2019s right-leaning Hindu nationalist ideologues have long had an ambivalent relationship with Gandhi. Some view his dedication to nonviolence as a form of weakness, or think he betrayed the cause of Hindus with his support for religious pluralism. Earlier this year, one politician from the ruling party even described the man who assassinated Gandhi as a \u201cpatriot.\u201d\n\nIn many parts of the world, \u201cGandhi is seen broadly as a nice, decent, open-minded, reasonable guy who advocated nonviolence, justice, peace and so on,\u201d said Ramachandra Guha, a historian and author of a two-volume biography of Gandhi. But in India, \u201chis ideas and legacy have been deeply contested.\u201d\n\nGandhi is often given the title \u201cMahatma,\u201d or \u201cgreat soul,\u201d and many in India refer to him simply as \u201cBapu,\u201d a word for father. He inspired leaders such as Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who wrote that Gandhi served as a \u201ccontinual reminder\u201d that \u201cit is possible to resist evil and yet not resort to violence.\u201d But in his long life in the public eye \u2014 his collected works comprise nearly 100 volumes \u2014 Gandhi delved not only into politics, but also economics, religion, sexuality, sanitation and even diet.\n\n\n\nMohandas Gandhi, center seated, is surrounded by workers in his law office in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1902. (Associated Press)\n\nOne recent critique centers on Gandhi\u2019s two decades in South Africa as a younger man. During that time, he repeatedly referred to black South Africans using a racial slur and described them as inferior to Indians, views that prompted a university in Ghana to remove a statue of Gandhi late last year.\n\nA growing number of writers and scholars have also criticized Gandhi for his views on India\u2019s caste system, saying he was a conservative who believed in preserving hereditary roles for different caste groups in Indian society rather than eradicating them.\n\nGandhi denounced the practice of treating certain people as \u201cuntouchable\u201d or somehow polluting. Yet he also believed in having a \u201charmonious social order,\u201d said Anand Teltumbde, one of India\u2019s preeminent scholars on caste and the author of a recent manuscript on Gandhi. \u201cThe caste system provided that order,\u201d Teltumbde said.\n\nOther scholars say that Gandhi advocated a gradual reform of the system because he did not want to alienate the upper castes, which were crucial to the independence struggle.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Gandhi at an event in Gujarat, the home state of both men. Gandhi was an advocate for better sanitation, and Modi is using his 150th birthday to celebrate the government\u2019s \u201cClean India\u201d campaign, which has constructed millions of toilets nationwide. Because of the program, India\u2019s rural areas have essentially eradicated the practice of defecating outside, Modi said, although experts cast doubt on that claim.\n\nModi also praised Gandhi in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, saluting him for giving \u201ccourage to millions globally\u201d and for envisioning \u201ca world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity.\u201d Modi challenged \u201cthinkers, entrepreneurs and tech leaders\u201d to find innovative ways to spread Gandhi\u2019s ideas.\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pays his respects to Mohandas Gandhi at Parliament House in New Delhi on Oct. 2 to mark the 150th anniversary of Gandhi\u2019s birth. (Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nModi\u2019s emphasis on honoring Gandhi in association with the cleanliness campaign strikes some of those who knew him as a strategic choice. Although Gandhi did advocate improved sanitation, they say, it was not his central message.\n\n\u201cThose connected to the current Indian regime are using a fragment of Gandhi to destroy the core of Gandhi,\u201d said his grandson Rajmohan Gandhi, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cThe core of Gandhi is equality and especially minority rights.\u201d\n\nModi \u201cexalts Gandhi as a prophet of cleanliness and recycling,\u201d added Guha, Gandhi\u2019s biographer. \u201cHe never talks about what Gandhi lived and died for, which was Hindu-Muslim harmony.\u201d\n\nGandhi was assassinated in January 1948 by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist. Godse was a former member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist organization that is the ideological parent of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. (Modi spent much of his life as a full-time RSS worker.)\n\nIn May, Pragya Thakur, days before she was elected to India\u2019s parliament for the BJP, hailed Gandhi\u2019s assassin Godse as a \u201cpatriot.\u201d Modi said Thakur\u2019s remarks were \u201ccondemnable\u201d and she apologized, but the party ultimately took no action against her.\n\nSome rue the fact that Gandhi is becoming irrelevant in today\u2019s India. He has been reduced \u201cto a ritualistic presence in our collective life,\u201d Apoorvanand, a professor at Delhi University who goes by only one name, wrote this month. \u201cHe has been made a lifestyle guru, a feel-good presence \u2014 something he never was.\u201d To embrace Gandhi would mean reviving \u201ca politics of dissent . . . which sometimes requires going against one\u2019s own people.\u201d\n\nWhen Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi, his grandson Rajmohan was 12. Now Rajmohan is 84, older than Gandhi was when he died. Rajmohan said he took heart from a recent video of an Indian high school student reciting a poem praising Gandhi that went viral.\n\n\u201cThere is a stubborn core of people who have understood him and know that Gandhi represents the better angels of the Indian nature,\u201d said Rajmohan. Gandhi is \u201cnot finished in India \u2014 no, sir.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nIndian politician calls the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi a \u2018patriot\u2019\n\nWhat did Mahatma Gandhi think of black people?\n\nAfter a petition called Gandhi \u2018racist,\u2019 his statue was removed from the University of Ghana\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Critics both on the left and the right have taken aim at the\u00a0\u201cfather of the nation.\u201d", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N9TuL4r6V56NRLd6eu-tyrOlQ-E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GNY2YMXFEQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
