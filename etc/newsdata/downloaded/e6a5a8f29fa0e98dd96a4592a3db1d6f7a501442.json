I would never want to sit and watch a show like The X Factor slowly fade away and fail.'\n\nX Factor continues to remain the highest watched show on ITV for 16 to 34 year olds, however, the ratings blow will no doubt add fuel to growing speculation that ITV's new head of entertainment, Katie Rawcliffe, is ready to pull the plug on the show after more than 15 years.\n\nThe executive \u2013 who began her TV career as a researcher on another talent show, Stars In Their Eyes \u2013 is said to favour a 'kinder' sort of television, away from the sometimes barbed comments for which The X Factor judges, including Cowell, have become known.\n\nKatie is also not as close to Cowell as her predecessor, Siobhan Greene, who helped the mogul set up his Syco entertainment empire, which makes The X Factor, in 2003. She left ITV last month to set up her own production company,\n\nSpooktacular! In comparison, X Factor's longstanding rival Stictly Come Dancing, pulled in an average of 9 million people for its Halloween week\n\nA source told The Mail on Sunday: 'Katie's brief is to find new formats and new shows. She's very bright and wants to modernise the entertainment on ITV's schedule.\n\n'She is breaking up the old guard and looking forward to making her mark. Simon used to hold all the cards when it came to his deals, but now it isn't such a one-way street.'\n\nAn ITV spokesperson told MailOnline: 'ITV enjoys a very close working relationship with Syco and Thames and are currently negotiating a new deal for 2020 and beyond. This will be announced in due course.'\n\nAn insider added to MailOnline: 'ITV, Syco and Thames have worked together for many years and continue to work closely together on two of Britain's most loved shows'\n\n'The X Factor Celebrity is currently the highest rating show on Saturday nights for ITV - proving that it remains one of the most watched shows on television.'\n\n'Auditions have already been announced for BGT 2020, so everyone is looking forward to seeing what is come next year.'", "description": "The ITV series recorded just 2.96 million viewers at one point, after a whopping 800,000 people switched off during the first live show.
