These demographic trends are afflicting much of the developed world, and have taken an especially severe toll on Europe\u2019s economic fortunes. To this point, the aging of the baby-boom generation has done less damage to America\u2019s prosperity because our nation has been exceptionally attractive to \u2014 and welcoming of \u2014 working-age immigrants from overseas.\n\nBut in the Trump era, that is beginning to change. While White House senior nativist Stephen Miller failed to get his plan for halving legal immigration through the Senate, the Trump administration has succeeded in scaring away those huddled masses yearning to fill the gaps in America\u2019s graying labor force. In 2018, our nation attracted 70 percent fewer immigrants than it had the year before, the largest such decline since the Great Recession, according to a new Brookings Institution analysis of the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey data.\n\nThis drop is remarkable, given the economic context in which it occurred. In 2018, America\u2019s unemployment rate dipped near historic lows, and reports of labor shortages in several parts of the country proliferated. Historically, such conditions have typically sparked an acceleration in new arrivals to the U.S. But the xenophobic drift of U.S. policy ostensibly repelled more immigrants than the strength of our economy attracted. As the New York Times reports:\n\nExperts said much of last year\u2019s drop was probably an indirect effect of President Trump\u2019s approach to immigration policy. Congress sets most limits on immigration, but a president\u2019s policies can also have an effect. Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries in 2017 has stranded thousands of immigrants abroad. He has cut the number of refugees and created new procedures that make processing visa applications more onerous. \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s probably no one factor,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of United States research for the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a number of small factors, a lot of which are related to policy changes and to the general effect of Trump being president.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect if it became more difficult for some immigrants to get to the U.S. and others found the country less welcoming.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cnationalist\u201d supporters may applaud these developments. After all, in their telling, mass immigration has been eroding America\u2019s social cohesion (and/or racial homogeneity). But those same nationalists also tend to be deeply concerned about safeguarding American prosperity and checking the power of a rising China. And those goals are simply incompatible with reducing immigration inflows into the U.S. Human beings are the ultimate resource. China has a lot more of them than we do. It will be exceedingly difficult for America to sustain its living standards or preeminence on the world stage unless it makes expansionary immigration a priority of public policy.\n\nTo be sure, there are policies that could help arrest America\u2019s declining birth rate. Providing U.S. families with the kinds of child allowances and subsidized day-care benefits that are commonplace in other developed countries would be a start. But as Bloomberg\u2019s Adam Minter has explained, these policies have proven insufficient to avert demographic decline in every nation that\u2019s tried them:\n\nSingapore\u2019s efforts on this front date back to 1984, when the government established a matchmaking agency for university graduates. Over the years, official initiatives have expanded to include paying cash bonuses to families for having children (the more kids, the more lucrative), generous maternity and paternity leave policies, childcare subsidies and other benefits. In Japan, pro-natalist policies were first introduced in 1991 and many go further than Singapore\u2019s; for instance, men can qualify for a year of partially paid paternity leave. And in South Korea, spending on pro-natalist policies adds up to around half of the defense budget\u2026But the fact is that they\u2019ve failed to meaningfully increase fertility rates. As a result, Asia\u2019s wealthiest economies are increasingly turning to immigration as a short and long-term means of addressing worker shortages.\n\nAll of which is to say: Trump\u2019s immigration policies appear to be working. And if America\u2019s nationalist right can sustain that success, they will do their counterparts in Beijing a great favor.", "description": "In 2018, the U.S. immigrant population grew at its slowest rate since the Great Recession. Meanwhile, our nation\u2019s birth rate fell to a 32-year-low.  That\u2019s bad news for America \u2013 since a nation\u2019s prosperity and power declines with its population.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/26-immigrant-detained-border.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
