And she\u2019s got some ideas up her sleeve for a future iteration of the series.\n\nThe actress told Fox News that Trip Friendly -- the producer with rights to the show -- wants to do a feature film. But fans, according to Arngrim, have been \u201crabid for having it exactly how it was.\u201d Thus, she says, \u201cI think if they rebooted it for TV, they could get away with it.\u201d\n\nArngrim says everywhere she goes; she\u2019s constantly hearing requests for getting the cast back together. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much of us left but we\u2019d definitely all do it,\u201d she proclaims, adding that she formed lifelong friendships on the set; the group remains close to this day.\n\nALISON ARNGRIM TALKS 'LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE' DAYS, REVEALS WHAT SHE'S UP TO NOW\n\n\u201cThe camaraderie, the relationships, thank God, they're still going. Many of us do live in L.A. and those who don't, we are all on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and we're always harassing each other on the Internet all the time,\u201d she says, adding that the last time they all got together was for a mini cast reunion in Walnut Grove, Calif.; in July. The gang has even taken little trips to France.\n\nSo what does the actress who brought Nellie to life have in mind for the beloved series?\n\n\u201cI would like to see a reboot of the show with the fabulous new young people, some adorable little girls in L.A., a gorgeous little blond awful child, as me, but have everyone from the old show do like a cameo, just pop in,\u201d she reveals. \u201cAlso, I am the correct age now to play Mrs. Oleson and I'm available, so I have no shame. I would play her in a second. I would totally do that,\u201d she adds.\n\n\"Can we get Millie Bobby Brown in a blonde wig? Because she would knock it out of the park.\" \u2014 Arngrim on who she'd like to see play Nellie Oleson today\n\nAnd Arngrim has already worked out some of the casting, for Nellie at least. \u201cCan we get Millie Bobby Brown in a blond wig? Because she would knock it out of the park,\u201d she insisted, deeming the \"Stranger Things\" star \u201cone of the best young actresses of today.\u201d\n\nArngrim still catches \"Little House\" when she sees it on TV. She\u2019s seen it many times. That includes one episode in particular, which she thinks she's seen a thousand times. That's Season 3's \u201cBunny,\u201d in which, after falling off her horse, Bunny, Nellie ends up in a wheelchair at the top of a hill. She ends up crashing down.\n\n'BEWITCHED' STAR ERIN MURPHY SHARES WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR HER TO DO A REBOOT\n\n\u201cIt's everyone's favorite. It's the funniest thing 'cause everybody wants Nellie to really get it and she really gets it,\u201d Arngrim proclaimed while attending the Hollywood Museum Celebrates the 55th Anniversary of \"Gilligan's Island\" event.\n\nShe also let Fox in on a little behind-the-scenes scoop from filming that infamous wheelchair scene.\n\n\u201cIt was so insane because there were no seatbelts in that thing. It's like an 1800s wheelchair and I'm basically in my nightgown and underwear and bedroom slippers,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had the stunt girl do the somersault but I did the rest of it,\u201d Arngrim reveals, noting that after filming once, the producers took her to the top of a longer hill so they could capture more footage of her screaming.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re going to use the stunt girl for this, right?\u2019 and they said, \u2018We need close-up footage of you, so we can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Arngrim recalls, adding that she was absolutely terrified but went through with it in the end.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe first thing she did once she got down the hill and out of the chair was take stock of her body to make sure it was all in one piece.\n\nThough she admits to being genuinely terrified filming that scene, she's genuinely delighted with the final product.\n\n\u201cIt was totally worth it!\u201d", "description": "Arngrim played Nellie Oleson on the western drama series.", "authors": ["Nicole Pajer", "Arngrim On Who She'D Like To See Play Nellie Oleson Today"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-628283244.jpg"}
