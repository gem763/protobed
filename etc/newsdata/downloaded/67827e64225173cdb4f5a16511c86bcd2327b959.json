Data was still being analysed, he told a room full of distraught scientists at the agency\u2019s tracking centre in Bengaluru.\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the Isro control centre, offered words of support to scientists before leaving the tracking centre.\n\nThe mission, which aimed to carry out a soft landing on the moon, is the most complex and ambitious space project that India has embarked upon. Only three other countries \u2013 Russia, the US and China \u2013 have managed such a landing.\n\nThe ISRO tweeted: \u201c#VikramLander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost. Data is being analyzed.\u201d\n\nIndia's Chandrayaan-2 moon mission lifts off a week after aborted launch Read more\n\nAchieving a soft landing, where the lander is not damaged, is especially challenging. \u201cIt is very hard,\u201d said Pallava Bagla, author and science editor for NDTV. \u201cIsro has worked for more than 10 years to reach this point \u2026 This is rocket science, there can be failures. It is not that everything can go exactly in the copy book fashion.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s achievements in space have been hailed by Modi as a symbol of the country\u2019s rising ambition as a global power.\n\nModi later later said on Twitter: \u201cWe remain hopeful and will continue working hard on our space programme.\u201d\n\nIndia, he added, is proud of its scientists. \u201cThey\u2019ve given their best and have always made India proud. These are moments to be courageous, and courageous we will be!\u201d\n\nThe mission, which comes amid a renewed global interest in moon exploration, was watched closely by scientists around. It is hoped the rover, named Pragyan, which means \u201cwisdom\u201d in Sanskrit, would spend two weeks collecting crucial data about the composition of the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nIt is due to explore craters which contain a fossil record of the early solar system, for clues on the origin and evolution of the Moon. It is also hoped Pragyan, a six-wheeled vehicle, could help scientists understand how much water the polar region contains.\n\nMathieu Weiss, a representative in India for France\u2019s space agency CNES, said such information is vital to determining whether humans could one day spend extended periods there.\n\nTimeline of Indian moon mission Timeline of Indian moon mission\n\n\u201cIndia is going where probably the future settlements of humans will be in 20 years, in 50 years, 100 years,\u201d Weiss told AFP.\n\nChandrayaan-2, which cost about $140m (\u00a3114m), far less than other missions, is an entirely indigenous project. \u201cThe lander, the rover, the rocket, the orbiter \u2013 everything was made in India,\u201d said Bagla.\n\nBagla added that it is \u201ca symbol that shows India is marching towards what prime minister Narendra Modi repeatedly calls his effort to make a new India\u201d.\n\nSivan had described the prospect of the lander\u2019s 15 minute descent \u2013 navigating its way autonomously \u2013 as \u201cterrifying\u201d.\n\nChandrayaan-2, he said, is the \u201cmost complex mission ever undertaken by Isro.\u201d\n\nAs well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by 2022.", "description": "Prime minister Narendra Modi consoles scientists distraught as complex mission goes awry", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad27030f64e426b5f4139804ea8d042a569655d5/0_423_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a345f4fbbafbbed0520299771ebe9af0", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
