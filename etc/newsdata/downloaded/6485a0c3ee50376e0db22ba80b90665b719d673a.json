The reality is that we have presented ourselves with another opportunity at the right end of the tournament. But we\u2019ve got to stay on process.\u201d\n\nHis message was picked up by Courtney Lawes, whose previous two World Cup campaigns with England ended in recrimination and humiliation for the Red Rose brigade.\n\nThe Northampton star said: \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got the opportunity to make history but it\u2019s not just going happen.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about this team is we are used to not getting ahead of ourselves. We know that there is a way we\u2019re going to have train this week, and things we have to do, to put ourselves in the best position to come away with a win and make history.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa are tough guys, they\u2019re brought up tough and they play tough,\u201d he added. \u201cBut so do we.\u201d", "description": "Tom Curry and Sam Underhill will be two of England's key players as they take on South Africa on Saturday looking to seal World Cup glory", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Franck Robichon Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters Dylan Martinez", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754135.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-New-Zealand-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Semi-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
