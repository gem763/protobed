The court heard she was so upset that the driver even asked if she had been raped.\n\nPolice were alerted once she was at her friend's address and Baldwin was arrested.\n\nHe gave three differing accounts to officers, maintaining during two interviews that he had not even had sex with the woman.\n\nHe initially said he had fallen on top of her as he made his way through the spare room after visiting the bathroom. He said he apologised and then left.\n\nBut when later confronted with DNA evidence found on the woman, Baldwin claimed that it may have been transferred on to her from the pyjama bottoms.\n\nTold that was scientifically impossible, he then admitted having sex with the woman.\n\nBut he maintained it was consensual and had been instigated by the victim.\n\nBaldwin had denied rape but after a four-day trial in August, he was unanimously convicted by a jury of eight men and four women at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, after deliberating for just over two hours.\n\nBaldwin, pictured outside court, told police he initially lied to them as he was afraid his girlfriend would dump him\n\nMaidstone Crown Court, pictured, heard the victim went home with Baldwin and went to sleep in a spare room. She said she woke up to find Baldwin on top of her having sex. The jury of eight men and four woman unanimously decided that the woman had been raped\n\nSentencing him at the same court today, Judge Adele Williams said Baldwin was 'convicted on compelling evidence'.\n\nShe told him: 'In the early hours, you went into that spare room, you got on top of her and raped her. She was asleep.\n\n'She asked you what was going on. You told her to be quiet.\n\n'This was deliberate, brutal and humiliating, and it was the rape of a woman who was asleep.'\n\nBaldwin, wearing glasses and a grey jumper with his hair tied in a knot, did not show any emotion in the dock.\n\nJudge Williams continued: 'I have read a victim personal statement which sets out the extent of the trauma that you caused her.\n\n'She was fearful, she was not able to sleep, she has had counselling and medication.\n\n'It has affected every aspect of her life and her employment.'\n\nJudge Williams said the victim 'felt shame in telling her parents what had happened' and she now asks herself the question: 'Why me? What have I done to be treated like my body is worthless?'\n\nThe judge said: 'I have no doubt that you have caused great harm to your victim.\n\n'You are a selfish and self-centred young man who has shown no remorse or insight into your crime.\n\n'On this occasion, you thought of no one but yourself and your own desire to satisfy yourself sexually.'\n\nThe court heard Baldwin has been suffering with depression.\n\nHis defence barrister Danny Moore said 'very little can be said in relation to the offence after a jury has convicted' but asked for the minimum sentence to be imposed on his client.\n\nHe said: 'The evidence did not suggest any degree of premeditation.\n\n'The defendant is still quite young. He is 31. This will be his first sentence of imprisonment.\n\n'He had one caution and in my submission, his character, his lack of convictions, is something which, in our submissions, should reflect on the sentence passed.'\n\nBut Judge Williams said the rape had caused the victim 'severe psychological harm' and that she 'was particularly vulnerable' because she was very drunk and Baldwin 'knew that'.\n\nBaldwin claimed when giving evidence that he and the woman were both very drunk during an evening out in Rochester, Kent.\n\nHe told the jury he had been drinking double measures of rum and vodka throughout the evening, and they ended up 'flirtatiously dancing and grinding' with each other in a nightclub.\n\nHe said they then had sex after he stumbled in the dark over the edge of her bed, and landed with his head on her chest.\n\nBaldwin claimed the woman then began to touch him intimately before removing her pyjama bottoms and having consensual sex for four to five minutes.\n\nHe alleged she was 'responding positively' as he kissed her breasts.\n\nBut the victim told the court she thought she was 'going to a safe place' when she went back to Baldwin's home that night.\n\nShe went straight to bed but then recalled waking up to see Baldwin above her. 'I saw his hair coming down. I was confused because I'd been in a deep sleep,' she said.\n\n'He was having sex with me. I had no pyjama bottoms or underwear on.'\n\nThe woman said she was drunk but knew what was going on.\n\n'It was like he was trying not to wake me,' she added. 'He then went back to his room. I went to the toilet and was sick.'\n\nHaving phoned for a taxi, she sat on a wall outside the house.\n\nShe continued: 'I couldn't stop crying. The Uber driver asked me what had happened. He asked me if I had been raped and I said yes.'\n\nThe victim had denied flirting, dancing in a sexual manner or being attracted to Baldwin.\n\nWhen it was suggested she had had 'drunken, consensual sex' which she immediately regretted and was then 'concerned about the fall-out', the woman told the court: 'It was not consensual. I know what happened to me.'\n\nOf the varying accounts he gave to police, Baldwin said he was 'stupid and naive' and lied because he feared losing his girlfriend over what he said was 'a one-night stand'.\n\nWhen it was suggested that it was 'far worse' for his partner to find out he had been accused of rape, Baldwin replied: 'Yes, but I didn't want her to know I had cheated.'\n\nPolice had been informed of the rape just before 6.30am and Baldwin was arrested at his home three hours later.\n\nThe court had previously heard Baldwin had moved in with his parents in St Mary's Island, Chatham.", "description": "Rapist Shane Baldwin, pictured outside Maidstone Crown Court in August, has been jailed for eight years for attacking a sleeping woman at his house in Chatham, Kent in May 2017.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19593324-0-image-a-32_1570804307226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
