What\u2019s more, one of Schiff\u2019s Democratic staffers advised the CIA officer about filing the complaint.\n\nAnd what\u2019s worse, the California congressman said on television that his team had not spoken to the whistleblower, which was flatly untrue.\n\nIMPEACHMENT INTENSITY: TRUMP DECRIES 'COUP' AND 'CORRUPT MEDIA'\n\nAt the very least, this creates the appearance that Schiff was quietly orchestrating the rollout of the complaint, which he then decried and which his panel is now investigating as grounds for impeachment.\n\nNow I\u2019m already hearing the spin of reporters on this story that this is routine, that it\u2019s standard procedure, nothing to see here, move right along.\n\nBut at a minimum, it looks bad. And politics is in part about appearances. If Republicans investigating Benghazi (who included Mike Pompeo) had secretly counseled a source who then filed a complaint about Hillary Clinton\u2019s conduct, the press would have gone nuts.\n\nTrump, who offered a rare expression of \u201crespect\u201d for the Times, eviscerated the lawmaker he insists on belittling as \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d He had already berated the congressman as a \u201clowlife\u201d for exaggerating his phone call comments at a hearing, demanded that he resign, and suggested (with a question mark) that he be arrested for treason.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s presser Trump called it a \u201cscandal\u201d and went a step further about Schiff and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint:\n\n\u201cI think he probably helped write it, OK? That\u2019s what the word is.\u201d There is no evidence for that charge.\n\nA Schiff spokesman said the staff never saw the complaint in advance and took the standard step of referring the CIA officer to an inspector general and suggesting he hire a lawyer. The whistleblower, he told the Times, had merely \u201ccontacted the committee for guidance.\u201d\n\nBut Schiff himself told a different story two weeks ago on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d In response to a question from the Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein, Schiff said on the MSNBC show:\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\u201d the California Democrat responded. \u201cWe would like to, but I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised as the law requires by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress.\u201d\n\nWas there an outraged media reaction? Only on some Fox shows. The other news channels barely covered it. CBS and ABC didn\u2019t bother to mention it on their evening newscasts.\n\nAnd what about Sam Stein, who asked the question? He tweeted: \u201cSchiff did appear to lie here in previously saying that his office had not spoken directly with the whistleblower. But if you care more about this stuff than the actual substance of the whistleblower complaint [then] you\u2019re being a hack.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s not hackery to be concerned with only one side\u2019s lies? No one is suggesting that Schiff\u2019s falsehood is on a par with Trump\u2019s alleged pressuring of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son while withholding military aid. (The president quite openly told reporters yesterday that he wants Ukraine, as well as China, to investigate the Bidens. Blunt, to be sure, but perhaps not the wisest move while trying to convince the country he didn\u2019t pressure Ukrainian President Zelensky.)\n\nA notably subdued Stein said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Thursday that Schiff had called him and \u201cexpressed regret for not having been more clear in his wording.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nCompare the media reaction to the Wall Street Journal report that Mike Pompeo was on that call, even though he feigned ignorance in an interview with ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. Much of the media denounced the secretary of state as dishonest.\n\nDuring the Russia probe, Trump constantly slammed Bob Mueller, his \u201cangry Democrats,\u201d Jerry Nadler, \u201cfake news\u201d and anyone else he saw as joining in the so-called witch hunt.\n\nNow the president is taking the same approach to discredit the latest \u201choax,\u201d and Schiff\u2019s dissembling has given him some ammunition.", "description": "No Trump probe is complete these days without a demand to investigate the investigators.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091868284001_6091869440001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
