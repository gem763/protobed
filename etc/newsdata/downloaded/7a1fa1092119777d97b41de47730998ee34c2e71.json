That change hasn\u2019t gone far enough, the federal government says, and now the city is facing water issues reminiscent of other areas, like Flint, Michigan.\n\nBoth cities are majority black with many residents living below the poverty line \u2014 groups that tend to suffer environmental crises disproportionately.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy (D) and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said Sunday that beginning Monday, bottled water would be available to city residents concerned about water quality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAccess to safe drinking water is critically important to our administrations and we take health risks associated with lead in drinking water very seriously,\u201d the officials said in a joint statement.\n\nThe move comes amid growing controversy over lead in Newark\u2019s drinking water, a problem that stretches back several years. Some of the city\u2019s lead service pipes are around a century old, sparking concern among public health experts. And since at least 2018, inadequate corrosion treatment at the Pequannock water plant has led to high lead levels in some residents\u2019 tap water, breaching 15 parts per billion, the standard set by the EPA.\n\nAfter downplaying the city\u2019s water issues for over a year, Newark in October 2018 gave away 38,000 water filters to address the problem. But residents say they still have lead in their drinking water. On Friday, the EPA sent a letter to the city and state advising bottled water usage for residents in homes with lead pipes.\n\n\u201c[W]e are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their heath is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices,\u201d the EPA wrote, after testing water at two residences in Newark.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the EPA has repeatedly said that water issues are the country\u2019s top environmental problem, above climate change. But Newark\u2019s crisis reflects ongoing contamination trends across the country. And it\u2019s not just lead that\u2019s leaching into the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d found in non-stick pans and many other everyday items have appeared in water around the country, including in Michigan. And in states like Iowa, agricultural runoff is polluting well water. In both instances, health and environmental advocates have argued the EPA is not doing enough to address the problem.\n\nBut the agency indicated it might assert its authority if Newark\u2019s situation does not improve. The EPA said it \u201cis prepared to take appropriate action\u201d to protect public health in the city.\n\nContact with lead can result in growth development problems, neurological issues, and occasionally fatalities. Lead in public drinking water can be especially problematic given the universal nature of water consumption.\n\nIn Flint, a drinking water crisis that began in 2014 affected around 100,000 people after the city switched its water source. Multiple deaths are associated with lead pollution there and residents have repeatedly accused public officials of lying to them about the extent of the issue. Litigation over responsibility for Flint\u2019s tragedy remains ongoing.\n\nEPA data has repeatedly shown that communities of color and low-income areas disproportionately suffer from environmental problems, like air and water issues. And while Newark, like Flint, is heavily black with a high poverty rate, the city has so far worked to avoid comparing the two situations, even as Newark\u2019s public health crisis grows.\n\nMayor Baraka has previously called on Trump to help Newark address its water issues. In January, Baraka told the White House the cost would likely be around $70 million. Prior to that, the city had historically argued that its water was safe to drink, despite concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the city is advising residents to run their taps for five minutes before using the water. Bottled water is only being distributed to certain residents who had previously received filters, although pregnant people and young children are advised to drink bottled water. Baraka has insisted that the bottled water is only a \u201cpreliminary precaution.\u201d\n\nBut advocates argue the city still isn\u2019t doing enough. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Newark Education Workers Caucus (NEW Caucus) sued city and state officials in 2018, arguing that systemic failures had allowed the lead contamination to occur. Both groups greeted the city\u2019s move towards bottled water for impacted residents but expressed continued concern.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply troubled by the City\u2019s announcement [confirming the lead issues],\u201d NRDC\u2019s Senior Director of Health and Food Erik Olson said in a statement, going on to express hope that both NRDC and NEW Caucus \u201ccan work cooperatively with the City to address this serious public health crisis.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1144427113.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
