It also marks another twist in a deal that began with a rare hostile bid and has drawn in U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management.\n\n\u201cThe board of directors has rescinded our previous opinion ... and has voted to withhold our opinion on whether or not to recommend tendering shares,\u201d Unizo said on Friday.\n\nFortress last month offered 4,000 yen ($37) a share for Unizo, trumping an earlier bid from travel agency H.I.S. Co (9603.T) that had made a rare hostile offer for the company at 3,100 yen a share.\n\nUnizo said on Friday Fortress had not fulfilled its demands including raising the price to 5,000 yen or met its concerns about employment and working conditions of current employees.\n\nThe tug-of-war over Unizo has marked a stark departure from most acquisitions in Japan, where takeovers tend to be pre-agreed deals waiting to be rubber-stamped. Unwelcome bids, like that from H.I.S., are particularly rare.\n\nFollowing\u2019s H.I.S.\u2019 exit last month, market participants had said Fortress could be pressured by Unizo\u2019s minority shareholders to raise its offer price.\n\nU.S. hedge fund Elliot Management holds around 11% of Unizo, while Japan\u2019s Ichigo Asset Management owns at least 6.6% according to recent filings.\n\nShares of Unizo finished up 0.9% at 4,510 yen, above Fortress\u2019 offer price.", "description": "Japanese hotel operator Unizo Holdings <3248.T> withdrew its support for a $1.3 billion takeover bid by a SoftBank-backed fund, saying it wanted better terms, just a month after it welcomed the \"white knight\" buyout offer.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
