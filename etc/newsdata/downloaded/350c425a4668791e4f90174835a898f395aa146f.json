The regular ritual of revealing actual performance versus the forecast guidelines gives investors the data they need to sort the grain from the chaff. The real trick is to interpret the results correctly.\n\nThat can depend on many factors, among the most important of which is volatility \u2013 and no market segment better shows that than the oil sector. Oil prices peaked five years ago, dropped sharply through 2015, and rose after early 2016. Crude prices gained steadily until Q3 of 2018, and then the bottom dropped out again. Since then, prices have failed to gain traction.\n\nHowever, Jeff Grampp, writing from Northland Securities, sees increasing production as boding well for the third quarter. He writes, anticipating the earnings reports, \u201cWe expect the focus during earnings to continue to be on FCF and capital discipline. Sentiment seems likely shaping up to not fully reward good performance but certainly ready to punish underperformance, similar to last quarter. Also, while we do not expect many 2020 guidance releases, we are hopeful to get some high level commentary on strategic direction and balancing growth/FCF in the current environment.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve dipped into TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener to find three small-cap oil producers from just that region. A look at where they stand now, and what industry analysts are saying about them, may offer some insight into what the Q3 reports have in store.\n\nCallon Petroleum (CPE)\n\nCallon is a pure-play oil company \u2013 the company drills and sells only crude oil. The company has exploration and development rights for assets three counties stretching across the Delaware and Midland Basins of the West Texas Permian formation. It\u2019s the heart of Texas\u2019 most productive oil patch, and Callon is reaping the profits of it.\n\nIn Q2, the company reported 23 cents EPS compared to the forecast 18 cents, for a beat of 28%. The estimate for the coming quarterly report is, again, 18 cents per share. Callon has a small market cap of just $934 million, and the stock is priced at a low $4.09.\n\nNorthland\u2019s Grampp says of Callon, \u201cWe expect much of the operational focus for CPE to be on success of its recent larger scale projects... We believe that the transaction should enable CPE to pursue an increased proportion of larger scale projects with a larger asset base. Recall, the company recently completed large scale projects in both the Delaware and Midland Basins.\u201d Grampp gives CPE a $7 price target, suggesting a 71% upside potential. (To watch Grampp's track record, click here)\n\nCowen analyst Gabriel Daoud is even more bullish on CPE. The analyst rates the stock an Outperform along with a $12 price target. Daoud\u2019s target implies confidence, as it suggests a whopping high 193% upside potential. (To watch Daoud's track record, click ere)\n\nDaoud noted, \u201cCallon's attractive footprint across the Midland and Delaware Basin supports a deep inventory of high-IRR drilling opportunities, among the most economic across the L48, which should drive peer-leading margins, debt-adjusted production / CF growth, and multiple compression, all of which help frame our positive investment case. Operational missteps appear in the rearview as we believe successful infrastructure investment, less non-productive time, and increased familiarity with newer assets leaves the company well placed for improved execution moving forward\u2026\u201d\n\nCPE\u2019s Strong Buy analyst consensus is derived from 6 \"buy\" and 2 \"hold\" ratings. The stock\u2019s low price offers investors a chance to \u2018buy the dip\u2019 on a high-upside opportunity. Shares are priced at $4.09, and the average target of $7.91 indicates potential for 93% growth.
