In the apology, the NBA owners note that Morey's message must have \"deeply offended\" fans and friends in China. They concluded Morey's sentiment was \"inappropriate.\" Brooklyn Nets Owner Joe Tsai's separate statement not-so-subtly hinted that the NBA had revenue on the brain.\n\nGuy was one of several people to condemn that \"disgusting\" decision.\n\nBut given how much cash is in the offing, Hollywood studios are willing to censor their own content to appease the Chinese government in order to maintain access to that giant market -- and the NBA is similarly willing to shelve its wokeness. Sorry, besieged Hong Kongers, Muslims in concentration camps, and forcible organ harvesting victims, there are mountains of money to be made; as such, 'core values' need to be flexible.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) added his two cents in a letter addressed to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, speaking out about the league\u2019s decision to side with the Chinese Communist Party over the freedom fighting demonstrators.\n\nLet\u2019s make this real simple. @NBA should apologize for groveling to Chinese Communist Party and cancel all exhibition games in China until the situation in Hong Kong is resolved. Peacefully. With the rights of Hong Kong\u2019s people protected. https://t.co/1fklDKs5my \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cRemember that some things are more important than money,\u201d Hawley wrote. \u201cRemember your responsibility. You may not think your League as an American undertaking, but whatever you think, what you say and do represents America to the world. And for an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling.\u201d\n\nThe senator suggested that the NBA bar all exhibition games in China until this delicate matter of democracy is resolved.\n\nHe added for good measure:\n\nIn case anyone not clear where Chinese Communist Party stands: \u201cWe believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 8, 2019\n\nSome other NBA figures were confronted about China this week, including the always outspoken Steve Kerr. Except, he wasn't so outspoken today.", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:29:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/271/d62df374-8a69-4aad-9c7f-38b4341a9cae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
