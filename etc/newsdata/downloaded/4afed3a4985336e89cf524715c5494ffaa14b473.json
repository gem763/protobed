This left our people defenceless,\" it said.\n\nThe Kurds called on Moscow, a close military ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to facilitate dialogue with Damascus.\n\nTurkish state broadcaster TRT said the army hit five posts in Ras al-Ain in northeastern Syria near the border with Turkey.\n\nTRT also showed footage of Turkish F-16 jets taking off from a military base in Diyarbakir, in southeastern Turkey, which it said were on their way to join the air campaign.\n\nThe Kurds say Ankara's real goal is to dilute their demographic dominance of the northeast with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees from other parts of the country now living in southwestern Turkey.\n\nThe Kurdish forces have also been accused of forcing out local Arab and Turk populations.\n\nIn Ras al-Ain, Kurdish-led security forces set up new checkpoints and stockpiled tyres to set alight to blur the vision of Turkish military pilots, an AFP correspondent reported.\n\nRas al-Ain was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday.\n\nKurdish authorities in the town called for protesters to gather at the border later on Wednesday and hoisted flags on tents.\n\n\"We will not leave this land,\" said Kawa Sleem, a 32-year-old Ras al-Ain resident told the AFP.\n\n\"War has been chasing us for years, and every day Erdogan threatens us with a new attack,\" he added, pledging to defend the area with \"all means available\".\n\nRas al-Ain was one of the first areas on which Ankara's planned offensive was expected to focus. Like Tal Abyad, further west, its population is mainly Arab.\n\nKurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels in both areas, covering streets with metal canopies to block the cameras of Turkish drones.\n\n'Stupid endless wars'\n\nOn Monday, US troops started pulling back from areas in northeastern Syria along Turkey's border, paving the way for the Turkish military action.\n\nRepublican critics and others said Trump was sacrificing an ally, the SDF, and undermining Washington's credibility.\n\n\"Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!,\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday before the operation began.\n\nRussia, al-Assad's strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria's Kurds on solving issues including border security.\n\n\"We will do our best to support the start of such substantive talks,\" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters during a visit to Kazakhstan.\n\nHe also accused Washington of playing \"very dangerous games\" with the Syrian Kurds, saying that the US first propped up the Syrian Kurdish \"quasi state\" in Syria and now is withdrawing its support.\n\nTurkey also wants a \"safe zone\" on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees it hosts from the eight-year civil war.\n\nThe Kurds have warned that a Turkish offensive would reverse the military gains achieved against ISIL and allow the group's surviving leaders to come out of hiding.\n\nWhile a Kurdish-led operation earlier this year saw the end of ISIL's territorial caliphate, the organisation is not dead and sleeper cells have been active in several parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nTurkey said it would not allow a resurgence of ISIL, but called on European countries to repatriate ISIL prisoners being held in Kurdish detention centres.", "description": "Turkish jets strike Syrian border towns controlled by Kurdish-led forces after US forces pulled back from the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/d7142cdd510c4abbbb84ccbcda1317dc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
