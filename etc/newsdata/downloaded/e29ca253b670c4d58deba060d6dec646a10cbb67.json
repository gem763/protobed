During the trial, it was revealed Uber's app had a security flaw that allowed fraudulent drivers not registered to the app to fool the system and pick up passengers.\n\nSingh had used an A4 photograph of an authorized driver to pass the security test that requires drivers to take a selfie before driving their vehicle, according to The Age.\n\nUber's \"real time ID check\" tool, also known as \"security selfies\", was rolled out in the US in 2016 and arrived in Australia in 2017. It randomly requests Uber drivers to take a selfie before they begin a ride. The tech, which utilizes Microsoft's facial recognition technology, is meant to help prevent the issue of people using cars and Uber accounts registered to other people.\n\nAccording to The Age, this technology loophole is being used to run illegal rackets involving up to 10 vehicles and multiple employees under a single authorized account.\n\nRead more: Uber and Lyft just took a major blow in California, and now they're gearing up for war\n\nIn online forums posts prior to 2016 seen by Business Insider Australia, self-identified Uber drivers asked others how to beat the identification system, and were advised to use an existing photograph instead of taking a new photo. It is a breach of community guidelines for someone other than the registered driver to operate an Uber account.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider Australia, Uber denied that this is a current issue. However, Singh's case appears to show that technology was not advanced enough in 2018 to distinguish between a photograph and a face.\n\nUber says it has updated its facial ID checks\n\nPablo Blazquez Dominguez / Getty\n\nA spokesperson for Uber said the company has made strides since last year to improve its safety technology and implement Microsoft's facial recognition technology.\n\nUber confirmed to Business Insider Australia that it introduced fraud detection technology and a human review process in 2019.\n\n\"Uber utilizes a security feature called real-time ID check alongside real-time human review and fraud detection technology. Among other checks, this technology can check that the image is not an image of another photo,\" an Uber spokesperson said.\n\n\"Together these help prevent fraud and protect riders by building another layer of accountability into the app to ensure the right person is behind the wheel.\"\n\nIn late 2018, it also introduced security features including an in-app emergency button for both riders and drivers, the ability to share your trip with others and, more recently, notifications that ask people to check their ride and driver details and contact them immediately if there is a mismatch.\n\n\"We also provide driver photos in the app so riders can confirm it's the right person picking them up. If the driver doesn't match the photo, report it to Uber right away so we can take action,\" the Uber spokesperson said.\n\nThe introduction of advanced security features - in particular the \"check your ride\" functionality - also follows the death in April of a University of South Carolina student who was murdered by a man she thought was her Uber driver but actually had no connection to the company.\n\nSome Uber drivers have complained in online forums about the technology which has become more strict, and about the fact that they need clear lighting and have to take a photo multiple times to be approved to continue driving. The robustness of the system is good news for passengers, but it may be making things more difficult for legitimate drivers.\n\nVictoria Police said it works closely with rideshare companies with regards to the safety of passengers.\n\n\"Victoria Police consults closely with stakeholders such as rideshare services to share intelligence and advice on ways we can work collaboratively to prevent and investigate crime. We are always looking at ways we can improve these relationships and combat any emerging crime issues,\" a police spokesperson said.", "description": "The move comes after an Uber driver in Australia pleaded guilty to raping a drunk woman.
