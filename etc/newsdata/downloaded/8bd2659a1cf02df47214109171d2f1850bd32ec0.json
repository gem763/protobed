It showed the economy added a modest 130,000 jobs in August, down from an average 156,000 new jobs a month over the past three years. July and June job numbers were also revised down.\n\nThe unemployment rate for all occupations stands at 3.7%\u2014more than double the jobless rate for tech positions, CompTIA said. It estimates that tech jobs accounted for 7.6% of the overall U.S workforce by the end of 2018, up from 7.2% in 2017.\n\nTechnology firms alone hired 11,400 workers in August. About 70% of those were tech-related positions, with the rest made up of marketing, sales and other business-side workers, the report said.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. on Monday said it was aiming to fill a record 30,000 full- and part-time open positions at offices, tech hubs and fulfillment centers across the U.S. While the open positions include entry-level jobs in the company\u2019s fulfillment centers, more than half are corporate and technology posts, including cloud architects, software developers and engineers, and computer vision scientists, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nCorporate recruiters are targeting several areas of IT, including cloud, data, systems architecture and cybersecurity, said Craig Stephenson, who oversees recruiting of chief information officers and chief technology officers in the U.S. and Canada for executive-search firm Korn Ferry .\n\n\u201cMore and more processes are being replaced by technology and more and more people are needed to build that technology,\u201d said Michael Solomon, co-founder and managing partner at 10x Ascend, an advisory firm for senior technology job seekers. As a result, he said, \u201ctech jobs are becoming, or perhaps have already become, some of the most important jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nBain & Co., a management consulting firm, estimates that by 2030, up to 9% of the labor market will consist of new or emerging job titles within areas such as IT development, hardware manufacturing, app creation and IT systems management.\n\nMartha Heller, chief executive of tech executive recruiting firm Heller Search Associates, said companies have come to rely on digital tools to boost operational efficiency, accelerate growth and fine-tune expense management, among other things. \u201cTechnology has become so integral to every facet of a company\u2019s operations, that technology hiring will continue to outpace other specialties for many years,\u201d she said.\n\nThe gains in tech employment don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, industry analysts say. The innovative technology that is fueling growth for IT workers is also poised to reduce the pool of some other jobs, as repetitive workplace tasks are replaced by advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, they said.\n\nMcKinsey & Co. researchers estimate that over the next few decades the adoption of automation technologies will affect half of the global economy.\n\nAs the next recession looms, employers and government agencies need to prepare for a significant shift in the labor market, Mr. Solomon said: \u201cTens of millions of jobs will evaporate in the coming decade and only a small percentage will be replaced with technology jobs.\u201d\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Employers are on a hiring spree for technology workers as U.S. businesses expand their use of cloud computing, data analytics and other emerging digital tools.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105490/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
