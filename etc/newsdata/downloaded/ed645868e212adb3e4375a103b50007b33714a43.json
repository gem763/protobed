As of last year, untapped home equity reached an all-time high of $14.4 trillion, about $1 trillion more than its pre-recession peak in 2005.\n\nBut before you begin funneling funds out of your home, know there\u2019s a right way and wrong way to do it. We rounded up the best and worst ways to leverage home equity, according to finance experts.\n\nHow To Leverage Home Equity\n\nThere are a few ways homeowners can tap into the equity they\u2019ve accumulated.\n\nOne option is a home equity loan. This type of loan is similar to a traditional mortgage, which is why it\u2019s also sometimes referred to as a second mortgage. Home equity loans are installment loans, which means the funds are disbursed in one lump sum and paid back over time in equal payments. They\u2019re also backed by \u2015 you guessed it \u2015 your home\u2019s equity. Usually, home equity loans have a fixed rate that\u2019s a bit higher than the primary mortgage but can be much lower than rates on other types of borrowing.\n\nAnother way to leverage home equity is through a home equity line of credit, or HELOC. Unlike a home equity loan, a HELOC allows you to borrow against your equity repeatedly and then pay off the balance, much like a credit card. Some HELOCs require that a minimum amount is disbursed initially, but there are no closing costs. Many HELOCs also provide a debit card and checks that you can use to easily access the funds.\n\nThere is one more option known as a cash-out refinance. Rather than taking out a secondary loan or line of credit, this involves refinancing the mortgage for a higher amount and taking the difference in cash. Even though you don\u2019t necessarily take on an additional loan with this method, you still increase your overall debt load (with your home as the collateral) and pay closing costs.\n\n4 Best Uses Of Home Equity\n\nIf you\u2019ve built up equity in your home over the years and are looking for a smart way to leverage it, there are a few ways to do it.\n\n1. High-Value Home Improvements\n\nOne of the most common uses of home equity is to invest in home renovations and upgrades. \u201cThe improvements that you make on the home will increase the value of your home and build more equity as a result,\u201d said Jared Weitz, founder and CEO of United Capital Source in Great Neck, New York. \u201cIn some instances, home improvement projects such as adding insulation to your attic or installing solar panels can, over time, generate more value than the cost to complete.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not always the case, however. Some home renovations actually contribute to a lower home value. So before you borrow against your equity for a fancy kitchen upgrade or new pool, be sure it\u2019s going to help, not harm, the resale value.\n\n2. High-Interest Debt Consolidation\n\nIf you have other types of debt that are accumulating interest at a much higher rate, using your home equity to consolidate it could be a smart move, according to Tony Matheson, a certified financial planner and founder of Matheson Financial Partners in Walnut Creek, California.\n\nHowever, that comes with a big, fat caveat. Debt can happen for a number of reasons. Perhaps you had to take out private student loans for college or live off credit cards during a period of unemployment. Matheson said that homeowners should first address the reason why that debt accumulated in the first place before considering debt consolidation using their home\u2019s equity. \u201cIf it was spending beyond your means, you need to address that issue first or you\u2019ll soon be right back in the same place, just with more debt,\u201d he said.\n\n3. Emergency Fund\n\nIdeally, you have about six months\u2019 worth of expenses tucked away in an emergency fund with your bank or credit union. But, as we all know, things don\u2019t always work out ideally.\n\nIf you experience a financial emergency and you\u2019re in the midst of a cash crunch, your home\u2019s equity can serve as a low-interest alternative to credit cards or payday loans.\n\nKeep in mind that if you don\u2019t have an existing HELOC in place, it might be too late to qualify for one once an emergency arises, according to Kyle C. Jackson, a certified financial planner and senior wealth manager at Jackson Wealth Advisors in Ada, Oklahoma. But if you do have one in place, Jackson said, it would be a smart way to address short-term financial needs while you ride out the storm.\n\n4. Real Estate Investing\n\nIf you\u2019re an experienced real estate investor, your existing home equity can be leveraged to purchase additional investment property. \u201cYou might be taking out debt here on your home, but you\u2019re exchanging that debt for another asset that potentially produces income,\u201d said Russ Ford, a financial planner in Indianapolis and founder of Wayfinder Financial.\n\nThat said, real estate investing is risky business. \u201cI\u2019d emphasize working with somebody else who has plenty of experience if it\u2019s your first purchase, so you don\u2019t get yourself between a rock and a hard place. Always remember it\u2019s not always smart to buy a property just because you can,\u201d he said.\n\n4 Worst Ways To Use Home Equity\n\nThough home equity can be used to accomplish a number of financial goals, it doesn\u2019t always make sense to touch it. Remember, your home is the collateral, so if you\u2019re unable to pay back what you\u2019ve borrowed against the equity, you could lose your property.\n\nBelow are a few situations in which it just doesn\u2019t make sense to rely on home equity.\n\n1. Buy A Car\n\nBuying a vehicle using home equity funds is generally a bad idea. \u201cI hear people wanting to do this all of the time, simply because the payment is lower,\u201d said Bryan Haggard, a certified financial planner and owner of Michigan-based RetireMitten Financial.\n\nHe explained there are two main reasons why you should almost never consider this. First, the interest rates on car loans have been relatively low, so you\u2019ll likely end up paying a higher rate on a home equity loan or line of credit. Second, the payoff terms on home equity loans are generally quite long. \u201cSo instead of paying off a loan within five years, you may spend the next 20 to 30 years paying off a car,\u201d he said. Not only would you end up with a loan that would likely last longer than the car, but you\u2019ll accumulate tons of interest over that time.\n\n2. Invest In The Stock Market\n\nAs tempting as it may be, another overly risky move is using home equity funds to invest in stocks and other securities.\n\nFor one, the cost of interest on the loan will significantly eat into your returns. \u201cAnd when you consider in the short-term market downturns that are often possible, you are better off leaving your money in a lower-risk investment,\u201d Weitz said. \u201cIf things go south, you run the risk of not only losing out in the market but also on your home.\u201d\n\n3. Fund A Vacation, Wedding Or Other Expensive Luxury\n\nYou worked hard to buy your home and want it to continue appreciating over time, so one of the worst things you can do is treat home equity like a free piggy bank, said Ron Strobel, a certified financial planner and founder of the Idaho firm Retire Sensibly.\n\nUsing home equity to pay for vacations, weddings and other non-appreciating expenses is at best a waste of the value you accumulated in your home. At worst, it puts your home at risk if you can\u2019t pay back the funds you borrowed. If you can\u2019t pay for these luxuries out-of-pocket, it might be a good idea to rethink your budget or give yourself some more time to save up.\n\n4. Cover Daily Expenses\n\nFinally, using home equity to fund your lifestyle and daily consumption is never recommended. \u201cIdeally, you invest your home equity in something that is highly likely to improve your life or provide a financial return on your investment,\u201d said Justin Pritchard, a Colorado-based certified financial planner and founder of Approach Financial Inc. \u201cIf you\u2019re borrowing to fund your standard living expenses, that money is probably not being put to its best use.\u201d", "description": "There's a right and a wrong way to tap your home's value.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5af5283f000033005a7bdf.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
