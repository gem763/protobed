A runaway train is about to hit five track workers. You can let them die by doing nothing, or you can switch the train to a different track with just a single worker on it. You would save five lives, but the one fatality would be the direct result of your actions. What would you do?\n\nThe dilemma has been posed in philosophy classes for generations, but the guest lecturer here at Notre Dame isn\u2019t a professor. He\u2019s a comedy writer. Michael Schur is the creator and showrunner of \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d a show entering its final season having gone where no network sitcom has gone before \u2014 the realm of moral philosophy.\n\nSchur is the guest lecturer at Meghan Sullivan\u2019s God and the Good Life class, a program she created to make philosophy less about remembering who was Kierkegaard and who was Nietzsche, and more a tool for decision making in everyday life. Sullivan began teaching the class in the fall of 2016, around the same time \u201cThe Good Place\u201d debuted, asking many of the same question about how to live a good \u2014 in the moral sense \u2014 life. The student was asking Schur about the Trolley Problem because a second-season episode was devoted to it, winding through increasingly absurd variations \u2014 would you kill five William Shakespeares to save one Santa Claus? \u2014 with bloody and hilarious results.\n\nWhen Sullivan first watched the show, she was pleasantly surprised to see an NBC sitcom explain utilitarianism, the principle that the best course of action is whatever brings the most good to the most people. The fact that the \u201cThe Good Place\u201d not only was aired by a major network but is about to begin a fourth season seems to her like a minor miracle.\n\nMichael Schur, creator and showrunner of \"The Good Place.\" (Photo: Rachel Luna/Getty Images) More\n\nSchur, who is 43, has had a brilliant career in comedy, along the well-trod path from the Harvard Lampoon to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and then \u201cThe Office,\u201d before creating \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn 99.\u201d In 2016, NBC Entertainment offered him the rare opportunity to create 13 episodes of any series he\u2019d like. Wanting to be remembered as something more than the father of the modern workplace sitcom, he took an unconventional approach, pitching a show about what it means to be a good person, and that would include scenes of a character standing at a chalkboard teaching philosophy.\n\nBut he also promised the network execs that it wouldn\u2019t come off as homework. What resulted from this process has been described fondly by one cast member as \u201cthe smartest, dumbest show on TV\u201d \u2014 a sitcom whose writing room has relied on a small staff of \u201cconsulting philosophers.\u201d\n\nThe premise of the series, whose pilot, Schur says, has been viewed over the years by 39 million people, could never be described as simple, but at the beginning it was easy enough to explain. Eleanor (played by Kristen Bell) dies and goes to heaven \u2014 the eponymous Good Place, designed and overseen by an immortal architect, Michael (Ted Danson). But she finds that her presence is a result of a clerical error and she was actually supposed to go to the Bad Place. She embarks on a quest for postmortem redemption, seeking guidance from Chidi (William Jackson Harper), a deceased professor of moral philosophy.\n\nAlong with Tahani, a name-dropping celebrity philanthropist played by Jameela Jamil, and Jason, a Florida DJ played by Manny Jacinto, Eleanor and Chidi find out \u2014 spoilers ahead \u2014 that their entire neighborhood is a ruse. The four of them are actually in the Bad Place, part of a pilot program put together by Michael (who is actually a demon) and based on French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s play \u201cNo Exit\u201d and his suggestion that \u201cHell is other people.\u201d", "description": "\"The Good Place\" premiered in the fall of 2016, an unlikely but fitting companion to the Trump presidency.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4er.0.Xtx8kAMWeBvX81hQ--~B/aD0xOTg2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3b5a2730-e06a-11e9-ad6b-a4cb15d85194", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
