Email your money conundrums to mytwocents@nymag.com Photo: Vintage Images/Getty Images\n\nI\u2019m in my early 20s, live in Brooklyn, and make about $45,000 a year in publishing. After rent, student loan payments, and pretty basic living expenses, I don\u2019t have much left over. But my best friend does, and she usually pays for me when we do things together. (Her family has money, and she has a job in finance and no student loans.) I\u2019d be lying if I said it made me all that uncomfortable \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to her. Whenever I\u2019ve said I feel bad about it, she waves it off. But I\u2019m worried about this long-term. Will it get to a point where she feels like I\u2019m taking advantage of her? I don\u2019t want to come off as a freeloader, but I don\u2019t want our financial differences to get in the way of our friendship, either.\n\nHaving been on both sides of this equation, I\u2019d say that for the most part, if someone wants to treat you to something, great! I can think of times (mostly in my early 20s) when friends with deeper pockets bought me drinks or dinner just because they could, and I\u2019m still grateful. One friend even gave me a pair of shoes for my 20th birthday \u2014 shoes that I definitely couldn\u2019t have afforded myself at the time \u2014 and I wore those things into the ground. The point is, your friend\u2019s generosity sounds really nice, as long as you\u2019re both on the same page about it. She offers, you say yes and thank you, she feels gracious and you feel gratitude, the end.\n\nThe thank-you part is key, though. To me, there\u2019s a clear line between freeloading and polite acceptance, and it all depends on how you acknowledge the nice thing that\u2019s being done for you. To figure out how you might do so, I consulted Lizzie Post, the co-president of the Emily Post Institute and an expert on modern etiquette and social taboos. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the receiving end of someone\u2019s generosity, enjoy it!\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the point.\u201d Also, say thank you twice: \u201cIt\u2019s important to say thank you when you accept the offer as well as afterward. Make sure you give that verbal thanks during the actual activity, and then send something written \u2014 a text or a note or email \u2014 later on.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, when your friend pays, don\u2019t make a weak protest. \u201cI hate the idea that people feel the need to falsely refuse,\u201d says Post. \u201cEither be true in accepting or true in refusing, but don\u2019t feel like you have to fake a refusal before you accept.\u201d\n\nUnless, of course, you really do feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve seen plenty of situations where generosity gets weird, and morphs into something more transactional. Maybe you start to expect your friend to cover every dinner bill, or worry that you vaguely owe something in return \u2014 red flags. If you feel like you can\u2019t turn down her invitations to hang out because you feel indebted to her, that\u2019s also a problem. I can understand your anxiety about drifting apart if you can\u2019t afford to do the things she wants to do, but her buying stuff shouldn\u2019t be a central part of what makes your friendship function.\n\nTo find out how you should handle this, I called Suzanne Degges-White, a professor and counselor who researches female friendship at Northern Illinois University (she is also the author of Toxic Friendships: Knowing the Rules and Dealing With the Friends Who Break Them). She explains that friendships usually include two types of support: emotional support (listening to your friend vent about a crappy day, etc.) and instrumental support (more tangible stuff like treating you to dinner or giving you a ride somewhere). \u201cFriendships are almost like a shared economy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll invest something and you\u2019ll invest something, based on what we can contribute. Plenty of us have friends who are in the lucky position of being able to pay for things and enjoy doing so. Ideally, we should be giving something back something that\u2019s of equal value, even if it\u2019s not the same commodity.\u201d\n\nBut friendship capital isn\u2019t tit-for-tat; it\u2019s complicated, delicate, and ultimately unknowable. Degges-White describes it like a pot that you\u2019re each contributing to: \u201cAt the beginning of a friendship, you\u2019re each putting little things in the pot, and then upping the ante and seeing how the other person responds,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you stop keeping tabs on how much or when someone put something in that pot, the friendship is solidified.\u201d\n\nPresumably, you aren\u2019t tallying up every dollar your friend spends on you, just like she (hopefully) isn\u2019t keeping track of the thoughtful things you\u2019ve done for her. But the only way to know for sure is to do the obvious: talk to her. When you bring it up, be curious \u2014 it helps to frame tough conversations with a question. You could start with something general, like, \u201cDo you ever feel like people take advantage of your generosity?\u201d Then be honest that you sometimes get anxious about pulling your weight, and you don\u2019t want her to resent you. People make false assumptions all the time about what\u2019s going on in their friends\u2019 heads; it\u2019s only fair that you give her the opportunity to speak for herself.\n\nAnd if she does admit that footing the bill for you gets annoying? Then it\u2019s a good thing you asked. This is your chance to set some boundaries around the whole situation and find out how you can reciprocate more in a way that\u2019s valuable to her. Maybe she\u2019s worried that you\u2019ll be less interested in hanging out with her if she stops paying for things, in which case you can put her mind at ease. Or maybe she\u2019s not sure how she feels, but now that you\u2019ve opened this channel of communication, you can keep talking about it.\n\nFinally \u2014 and this may go without saying, but \u2014 you should find at least one thing to do together that doesn\u2019t cost money. Sure, that can seem impossible in New York, but be creative. If she\u2019s a good friend, she\u2019ll be just as happy taking a walk with you as she would be anywhere else. And if she\u2019s not, well \u2026 that gives you some insight on where your friendship stands.", "description": "My rich friend usually pays for me when we do things together, and I\u2019m scared it will ruin our friendship.
