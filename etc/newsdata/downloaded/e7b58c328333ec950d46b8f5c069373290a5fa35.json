Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe NBA's first statement was cowardly. It began: \"We recognize that the views expressed by... Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\nMorey buckled and deleted his tweet. The NBA then went overseas to grovel.\n\nPOMPEO CALLS FOUL ON NBA'S CHINA TREATMENT\n\nA statement posted on the NBA's Weibo social media network in China stated that it was \"extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment,\" and as a result, Morey \"has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans.\"\n\nChina is a huge and lucrative market for the NBA. If business means turning your back on freedom while defending one of the most brutally repressive regimes in human history \u2013 so be it.\n\nThat abject surrender, that spineless concession to a government now shooting pro-democracy protesters in the streets drew near-universal condemnation in America, ranging in Washington from conservative Sen. Ted Cruz to socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nSo the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, readjusted to insist the league would not discourage athletes or executives from speaking freely. \"We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression\" \u2013 which is disingenuous. That is exactly what all of the NBA\u2019s \"extremely disappointed\" remarks implied.\n\nAnd the duplicity continued. In Philadelphia, a 76ers fan named Sam Wachs and his wife brought a pair of signs that read \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Free HK\" as the Sixers took on the Guangzhou Loong Lions, a Chinese Basketball Association team.\n\nWachs said he lived in Hong Kong for two years, so he sympathized with the protests. First, security confiscated the signs. When the couple yelled \"Free Hong Kong\" during the second quarter, Wachs said they were removed from the game.\n\nThen the same Chinese team played the Washington Wizards in D.C., and the routine repeated itself. Several fans standing with a sign reading \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Google: Uighurs\" had them confiscated prior to the game. (The Uighurs are a Muslim minority in northwestern China, with an estimated 1 million people held in concentration camps.)\n\nThe NBA now doesn't want to be political. But it's been very political on the home front, when it has suited its purposes, which is to say, when it placates the left.\n\nThe league moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte over a North Carolina law that in government offices, transgender people should use the bathroom of their gender \"assigned at birth.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe NBA commissioner criticized President Trump's travel ban on people from seven Muslim countries as going \"against the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great NBA.\"\n\nThe NBA allowed players to wear \"I can't breathe\" shirts to protest police after Eric Garner suffocated while laying down on the sidewalk in New York.\n\nNational Review's Jim Geraghty underlined the hypocrisy: \"Apparently the NBA is fine with protesting American police brutality, but not Hong Kong police brutality.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpeaking of American police brutality, nobody's found Colin Kaepernick saying anything about China's grip on the NBA.\n\nThe man with the Nike sneaker-selling slogan of \"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,\" is silent while Nike orders the removal of all the Houston Rockets merchandise from its stores in China. Apparently, America is still the most horrible country in the world that was founded on racism, slavery and genocide.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY L.
