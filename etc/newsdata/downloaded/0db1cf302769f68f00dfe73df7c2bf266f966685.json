With little sign of progress in the Brexit negotiations, there are fears that the country could end up leaving in a disorderly manner \u2014 a scenario that most economists think will cause damage to the British economy as tariffs and other impediments to trade with the EU are put up.\n\n\u201cAlthough actions by businesses and authorities have resulted in some improvement in the preparedness of the U.K. economy for a no-deal Brexit, material risks of economic disruption remain,\u201d the committee said.\n\nJohnson has consistently said that Britain will leave on the scheduled Brexit date even though Parliament has backed a bill that compels him to seek an extension to the deadline if no deal is reached at next week\u2019s EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels.\n\nWhatever happens at the end of the month, the bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said the \u201ccore of the U.K. financial system including banks, broker dealers and insurance companies is resilient to and prepared for the wide range of risks it could face, including a worst-case disorderly Brexit.\u201d\n\nIt said that even in the event of a deep recession that sees firms unable to repay loans or households falling behind on their mortgages, Britain\u2019s major banks have the capacity to absorb ensuing losses \u201cand still have significantly more capital than in 2007.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the committee said it was maintaining its so-called countercyclical capital buffer rate \u2014 a kind of rainy day fund \u2014 at 1%.\n\nIt noted that financial stability is not the same as market stability and that significant volatility in some markets is to be expected in a disorderly Brexit. Demand for U.K. assets, including the pound, could be expected to \u201cfall sharply.\u201d\n\nThe committee also warned Facebook that the cryptocurrency it plans to set up, Libra, will have to clear a series of hurdles if it\u2019s to be licensed in Britain.\n\nThough it said Libra has \u201cthe potential to become a systemically important payment system,\u201d it stressed that \u201csuch a system would need to meet the highest standards of resilience and be subject to appropriate supervisory oversight, consistent with the principles set out above.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The U.K. financial system is prepared to cope with a no-deal Brexit, though uncertainties about the country's withdrawal from the European", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/e58420_britain-politics-27004-anti-brexit-protesters-demonstrate-streets-as-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
