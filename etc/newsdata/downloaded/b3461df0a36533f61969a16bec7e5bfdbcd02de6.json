Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday told reporters that she will not get \u201cduped\u201d into talking about Joe Biden\u2019s (D) role in the so-called Ukraine \u201cscandal,\u201d urging reporters to \u201cleave Joe Biden alone.\u201d\n\nThe floundering presidential candidate told reporters that she will not get \u201cduped\u201d into discussing the former vice president\u2019s role in the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was making tens of thousands of dollars per month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said many times that on this issue of Ukraine, leave Joe Biden alone,\u201d Harris said, arguing that Democrats cannot go down that road because it is all part of the \u201ctrap\u201d President Trump has set.\n\nHarris went on:\n\nBecause I really do believe to go down that road is to fall into the trap that the president has laid, which is to manipulate the power of the president and the relationships that we have with allies like Ukraine in a way that has been about personal and political benefit.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to get duped into having that conversation,\u201d she continued. \u201cLet\u2019s leave Joe Biden alone\u201d:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get duped into having that conversation,\u201d Kamala tells Fox News on question about Biden/Ukraine. \u201cLet\u2019s leave Joe Biden alone.\u201d pic.twitter.com/X1fRJIbeCd \u2014 Christopher Cadelago (@ccadelago) October 7, 2019\n\nHarris has been a vocal proponent for Trump\u2019s impeachment and told MSNBC\u2019s Live on Monday that she would vote to convict Trump in the Senate if the impeachment inquiry reaches that point.\n\n\u201cYes. Based on everything I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Harris said, touting her past role as a prosecutor:\n\nI\u2019m a former prosecutor. And let me just tell you, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the subject, the main subject of the impeachment which is the issue of yet again Donald Trump eliciting help from a foreign government to interfere with the election of our president of the United States, in this case, we\u2019ve basically got a confession. We\u2019ve got a display of conscious consciousness of guilt in an attempt to cover-up. I don\u2019t know how much more we need but apparently a second whistle-blower, and we\u2019re going to get more. Based on everything we know, including an admission by this president, I don\u2019t know that it leads in any other direction except to vote yes. Which is what I believe I will do based on everything I know.\n\nDespite Harris\u2019s claim, the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed no such quid pro quo, as Trump\u2019s political foes suggest. It was Biden who, as former vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to the Ukraine unless officials fired the top prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings.\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d Biden said during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in January 2018.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d Biden bragged. \u201cAnd they put in place someone who was solid at the time\u201d:", "description": "Sen.
