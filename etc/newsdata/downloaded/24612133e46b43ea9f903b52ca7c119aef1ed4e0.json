Samoa won 34-9.\n\nA date for the hearings has yet to be set.\n\nSamoa winger Ed Fidow received a citing commissioner warning for punching in the same match.\n\nSamoa next plays Scotland on Monday in Kobe in Pool A.\n\n___\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nUruguay rocked Fiji with three first half tries to lead their Pool D match 24-12 at halftime at Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium.\n\nFiji started an immense favorite after winning the teams\u2019 three previous meetings, most recently 68-7 in England 10 months ago. But 19th-ranked Uruguay, the youngest team at the tournament, preyed on Fiji mistakes to build an emphatic halftime lead, inspired by scrumhalf Santiago Arata and hooker German Kessler.\n\nUruguay conceded a try after eight minutes to Fiji hooker Mesulame Dolokoto, then hit back with a brilliant try to Arata after a dropped pass by Fiji.\n\nFiji scored again through prop Eroni Mawi but Uruguay touched down twice more, through No. 8 Manuel Diana and center Juan Manuel Cat while flyhalf Felipe Berchesi added a penalty.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has changed all but two of his starting team for the Springboks\u2019 second game against Namibia.\n\nErasmus retained only center Lukhanyo Am and wing Makazole Mapimpi from the Springboks\u2019 XV that lost to New Zealand 23-13.\n\nIn a surprise move, Erasmus selected Schalk Brits, normally a hooker, at No. 8. Brits will also captain the team on Saturday with regular skipper Siya Kolisi on the bench.\n\nAs well as an entirely fresh pack, South Africa will have Herschel Jantjies and Elton Jantjies - no relation - starting at scrumhalf and flyhalf, and veteran Frans Steyn, a survivor of the Boks\u2019 2007 Rugby World Cup triumph, at inside center.\n\nThe Springboks have experience on the bench for a game they\u2019re expected to win and must win to stay on course for the quarterfinals.\n\nForwards Kolisi, Steven Kitshoff, Eben Etzebeth and Franco Mostert, and backs Damian de Allende and Cheslin Kolbe are among the reserves. They all started against the All Blacks.\n\n___\n\nSouth Africa: Warrick Gelant, Sbu Nkosi, Lukhanyo Am, Frans Steyn, Makazole Mapimpi, Elton Jantjies, Herchel Jantjies; Schalk Brits (captain), Kwagga Smith, Francois Louw, Lood de Jager, RG Snyman, Vincent Koch, Bongi Mbonambi, Tendai Mtawarira. Reserves: Steven Kitshoff, Thomas du Toit, Eben Etzebeth, Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Cobus Reinach, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nUnited States head coach Gary Gold rates his team as \u201csevere underdogs\u201d for the game against England in Kobe on Thursday.\n\nLike other coaches of Tier Two nations at the tournament in Japan, Gold stresses the so-called smaller teams just don\u2019t get enough games against the big nations to help them in their quest to improve.\n\nThe Eagles last played a top team late last year when they lost to Ireland 57-14 in Dublin. But earlier in 2018, the U.S. beat Scotland by a point in Houston. Those two are the U.S.\u2019 only games against top tier opposition in the last two years.\n\nThe U.S., like other lesser-ranked teams at the World Cup, can draw inspiration from Japan\u2019s \u201cMiracle of Brighton\u201d at the last World Cup, when the Japanese upset two-time world champion South Africa.\n\nGold says expectations of an upset in Kobe are low but \u201cthe England players, it\u2019ll go through their mind. Maybe not very long, but it\u2019ll go through their mind. What if? What if? What if?\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nFiji beat Uruguay 68-7 last November in England and is expected to win well in their Rugby World Cup match on Wednesday in Kamaishi.\n\nFiji made 12 changes after losing to Australia 39-21 last Saturday, but even with a four-day turnaround the Fijians should be too strong.\n\nUruguay gets its campaign underway six days into the tournament with an entirely domestic-based team, and the youngest in the tournament.\n\nThe Teros have two wins in World Cup history, the last 16 years ago.\n\nIt is the only match on Wednesday, and both teams will honor the first World Cup game at Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium in the small fishing town where more than 1,000 were killed by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup\n\nand https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The latest from Day 6 of the Rugby World Cup (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/japan_rugby_wcup_usa_87843_c0-125-1909-1238_s1770x1032.jpg?134d0e0c466132d15d5260b15b9f6bc007be72ec", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
