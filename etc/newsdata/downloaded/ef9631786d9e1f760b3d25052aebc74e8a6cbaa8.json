The current CIT is 20%.\n\nVietnam\u2019s standard corporate tax is 20%, but targeted firms will be offered a 10% tax for 15 years, a tax exemption for four years and a 50% tax reduction for nine years.\n\nThai Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said there would also be a special package on personnel development for companies to train Thai workers, or learning on the job, such as Google\u2019s plan to set up an academy in Thailand.\n\nThailand is already attracting some foreign firms looking to relocate production from China to escape U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nTOP DESTINATION\n\nBut Vietnam appears to be the top destination for firms hit by the trade war, due to lower wages and land prices.\n\nIn 2019\u2019s first half, Thailand\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) applications totaled 147 billion baht ($4.8 billion), while Vietnam\u2019s new FDI pledges were $18.74 billion.\n\nNattapol said Thailand\u2019s labor skills and infrastructure are better, and investment privileges are clear and stable despite a change in government.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s wages look lower, but there will be unstated additional costs,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThailand\u2019s daily minimum wage is 308 baht ($10)-330 baht ($10.78), while Vietnam\u2019s wages range from 97,333 dong ($4.2) to 139,000 dong ($6.0) per day.\n\nThailand ranked 38th in overall competitiveness while Vietnam ranked 77th, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report 2018.\n\nSupant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, said strength of the baht THB=TH is a major obstacle for drawing foreign investment and the government should take measures to tackle the problem.\n\nThe baht has strengthened 6.5% against the dollar this year.\n\n(Graphic: Thailand and Vietnam global competitiveness rank link: here)", "description": "Thailand is planning a \"relocation package\" of incentives to attract foreign companies looking to move production from China, officials said, seeking to compete with Vietnam to woo manufacturers looking to steer clear of the Sino-U.S. trade war.", "authors": ["Orathai Sriring", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
