Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility.\n\nHere are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate:\n\nBiden redirects on Ukraine involvement as impeachment takes center stage\n\nAs expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nWhen asked whether his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected.\n\nForeign business deals: Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter) made.\u201d\n\nVice President Joe Biden speaks in a Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n\nHunter Biden said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct.\n\nUkraine explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nThis debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support with varying levels of enthusiasm.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said.\n\n\"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBut Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives while pursuing impeachment: \"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long.\n\n\u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren the target of multiple attacks as her standing in polls rises\n\nSen.

(Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nWarren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was Warren's turn to take some hits.\n\nWarren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer.\n\nCosts will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\"\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\"\n\n\"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan.\n\nPolls: Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls\n\nMore data: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio\n\nKlobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump.\n\n\"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nOn wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said.\n\n\u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN's tracker, Warren had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes.\n\nO'Rourke and Buttigieg continue feud over gun buybacks\n\nBeto O'Rourke speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nAt the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate.\n\nO'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support.\n\nMore on buyback debate: Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d\n\nCalling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said, \"I don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been lost to gun violence.\n\n\u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d\n\nAre some candidates too old for office? They say no.\n\nIn a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election.\n\n\"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable.\n\nCandidates' ages: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.\n\nSanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage.\n\nBiden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said.\n\nWarren, 70, said she'd \"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nOn the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37. She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important.\n\nWomen's reproductive rights a question after push from Harris, Booker\n\nAfter a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate.\n\n\"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said.\n\nShe said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said.\n\nLater in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department review before states passed anti-abortion laws.\n\nKlobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.\n\nFor more highlights: USA TODAY's live blog from the 4th Democratic debate in Ohio\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/top-moments-tuesdays-democratic-debate/3991377002/", "description": "Tuesday's debate in the key battleground state of Ohio was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to gather on stage since the announcement of the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
