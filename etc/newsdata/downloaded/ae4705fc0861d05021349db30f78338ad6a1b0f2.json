The youngster glided into the area and slotted past Gunn.\n\nMount should have scored again when he drove wastefully wide from Abraham's pass.\n\nChelsea had kept only one league clean-sheet in seven games under Lampard and they were breached easily in the 30th minute.\n\nYan Valery was allowed to drift past four Chelsea defenders without a single challenge and he whipped a cross to Ings, who got across Kurt Zouma to poke his shot past Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\nValery had played a key role in Southampton's goal but he was guilty of deserting his post in the 40th minute and Marcos Alonso moved into the space vacated by the defender.\n\nAlonso's pass found Kante on the edge of the area and the France midfielder unloaded a shot that took a big deflection of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg on its way past the wrong-footed Gunn.\n\nBatshuayi came off the bench to wrap up Chelsea's stroll on the south-coast with a clinical finish in the 89th minute.", "description": "Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount celebrated their England call-ups by firing Chelsea to a rout of struggling Southampton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9145/df2000a5784542fa8548e0771b5ec304.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
