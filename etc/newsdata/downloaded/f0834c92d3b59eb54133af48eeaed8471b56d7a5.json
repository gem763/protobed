Ireland will not accept a hard border. Ireland will not accept a technological border. Ireland will not accept a time limit on the backstop. Ireland will not accept a foods only border proposal.\n\nGuess What?\n\nIf Ireland and the UK cannot agree to a deal that the EU also accepts, then a hard Brexit ensues unless the UK withdraws article 50.\n\nA hard Brexit is the default legal position.\n\nIn the event of a hard Brexit, the backstop will be gone.\n\nMathematically Impossible\n\nIreland's position is mathematically impossible in the event of No Deal.\n\nIreland will then have to choose between 2, 3, and 5.\n\nIreland will not choose option 2 as the burden will fall 100% on Ireland. Northern Ireland won't cooperate.\n\nA time limit just buys time. It will not solve the issue. However, a time limit in conjunction with option 3 or 4 is possible.\n\nMore likely is a combination of 3 and 5 with possibly an interim 4.\n\nCurious Irony\n\nUnless Ireland bends, a hard Brexit is the most likely outcome.\n\nI suspect Ireland's positions wavers with its assessment of stopping Brexit outright.", "description": "Ireland is driving a hard bargain in negotiations with Boris .10/03/2019 3:18:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2009/76/332f1f8e-7888-4ff3-9c74-b766b31598aa@news.ap.org.jpg"}
