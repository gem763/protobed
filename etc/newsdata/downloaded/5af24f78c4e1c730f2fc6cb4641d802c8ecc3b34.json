The company says where possible, it recycles the salvaged scooters.\n\n\u201cUsually you pull and you get it out,\u201d said Hadjali. One scooter though defeated him; its handlebar was wedged into the stone quayside and had to be left where it was.\n\nThe scooter clean-up patrol is one byproduct of a global explosion in shared electric scooters that has helped transform urban mobility but has also stoked a backlash from people angry that their city streets are littered with carelessly parked or discarded scooters.\n\n\u201cI walk by the Seine every day, and the past couple of years it\u2019s really become very dirty,\u201d said Paris resident Corinne Ducrey, who was watching Hadjali and his clean-up crew.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good idea. We should educate people so the electric scooters don\u2019t end up in the Seine - that\u2019s even better.\u201d\n\nThere are about 20,000 rental scooters provided by a dozen companies in Paris. The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has described them as \u201canarchic\u201d and transport minister Elisabeth Borne said the city was experiencing \u201cthe law of the jungle\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nTo try to restore control, officials this year started charging operators a fee to rent out their scooters and are levying on-the-spot fines on users caught parking the scooters in the wrong place or riding on the sidewalk.\n\nLime set up a team of workers, called the urban patrol, that combs the streets and waterways of Paris, clearing up discarded or badly parked scooters.\n\n\u201cWe collaborate closely with city hall because we need to have a good relationship with them,\u201d said the head of the team, Sonthay Detsaboun. \u201cThat\u2019s why we created the urban patrol.\u201d", "description": "The proliferation of electric scooters for rent in the French capital has spawned a new Parisian profession: scooter fisherman.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444922127&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1GK", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
