Against Tonga Ford and co will hope to take the first step towards redeeming themselves in similar fashion, having limped out of a disastrous home World Cup in 2015.\n\nEngland crash out of Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nEngland face Tonga at the Sapporo Dome, a futuristic stadium which hosts baseball, where the grass pitch will be wheeled in from outside for this match. While temperatures in Sapporo are far cooler than at England\u2019s pre-tournament base in Miyazaki, conditions at pitch level are expected to be humid under the roof and Eddie Jones has been preparing his side for a wall of noise.\n\n\u201cI searched that [football match] earlier in the week,\u201d said Ford. \u201cSomeone said England football played here in 2002 \u2013 I was nine I think. I don\u2019t remember watching it, but looking back I remember it now. I think they were wearing red that day and Beckham scored the penalty \u2013 so that\u2019s pretty cool knowing they played there.\n\n\u201cWhat a brilliant place to go and play in. The pitch is unbelievable. And [the stands are] very steep, so I\u2019d expect the atmosphere to be pretty special. There\u2019s not much wind so there\u2019s no excuses for us kickers. For a game where both teams would want to attack and score some tries \u2013 we want to defend well, of course we do \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be perfect conditions for that.\u201d\n\nJones revealed he has picked the brains of members of that England football side in order to help his players cope with the unique stadium. \u201cWe spoke to them and spoke about their experience at the ground,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThat all went into our preparation and planning for this game.\u201d", "description": "George Ford has revealed he has been seeking inspiration from the England men\u2019s football team\u2019s victory over Argentina in the Sapporo Dome in 2002", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e2961faa11a2326ce8777787477d42be65f057/0_41_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e588782f3a6c167e79023bdc4728229e", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
