We need reforms on how commercial aircraft are certified,' and how manufacturers like Boeing 'are watched' by regulators.\n\nDeFazio also blasted Boeing for a 'lack of candor' and pressed Muilenburg on why the company had not required data from crucial airflow sensors known as attack sensors when it originally designed the airplane.\n\nMuilenburg said the company had repeatedly asked the same question.\n\nThe 737 MAX, when regulators ultimately clear it to return to service, will have a number of new safeguards. It will take data from the attack sensors and not let MCAS activate more than once before a situation has been resolved.\n\nFamily members hold photos of the victims of Boeing 737 MAX crashes as Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg testifies before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday\n\nMuilenburg was also hammered during the hearing over his compensation, which rose last year to $23.4 million, and how he has not offered to resign in the wake of the crashes.\n\nIn the most intense exchange at the hearings so far, Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee on Wednesday thundered at Muilenburg, 'You said you're accountable. What does accountability mean - are you taking a cut in pay? Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem? These people's relatives are not coming back, they're gone. Your salary is still on,' he said, gesturing to family members of crash victims attending the hearing.\n\n'Congressman, it's not about the money for me,' Muilenburg said.\n\nCohen interrupted: 'Are you giving up any money?'\n\n'Congressman, my board conducted a comprehensive review,' Muilenburg said quietly, but clearly shaken.\n\nCohen thundered: 'So you are saying you are not giving up any compensation at all? You are continuing to work and make $30 million dollars a year after the horrific two accidents that caused all of these people's relatives to go, to disappear, to die?'\n\n'Congressman, again, our board will make those determinations,' Muilenburg said.\n\n'You're not accountable? You're saying the board's accountable?' Cohen said.\n\n'Mr. Congressman, I am accountable sir,' Muilenburg said.\n\nLater, Representative John Garamendi of California ticked off 'serious quality issues' on other Boeing flagship aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner and KC-46 aerial tanker.\n\n'You have a systemic problem in your company,' Garamendi said. 'You are pushing profits over quality and safety.'\n\nMuilenburg explained changes Boeing is making in the Max and other steps it is taking to improve safety.\n\n'We are learning, we still have more to learn, we have to work to do to restore the public's trust,' Muilenburg said.", "description": "CEO Dennis Muilenburg was\u00a0hammered by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday over flaws with the\u00a0737 MAX, which has been grounded for the past eight months in the wake of deadly crashes.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/19/20392334-0-image-a-17_1572464222827.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
