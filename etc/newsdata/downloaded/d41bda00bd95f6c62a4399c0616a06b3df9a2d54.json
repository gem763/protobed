More protests are planned this weekend and on the Oct. 1 anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nSong said it was to be expected that the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 would encounter difficulties because of its unprecedented nature.\n\n\"Indeed we have come across some problems in implementing 'one country, two systems' here in Hong Kong, and some problems are grave, which need serious consideration,\" he said, answering questions through an interpreter at a briefing for foreign media.\n\nUnder \"one country, two systems,\" the former British colony became part of China but retained its own legal system and greater freedoms than in mainland China.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China to face trial. Activists saw that as a threat to the legal rights that Hong Kong residents have under the framework.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has said it will withdraw the legislation, but the protesters' demands have grown to include fully democratic elections, an amnesty for arrested protesters and an investigation into alleged police violence against demonstrators.\n\nSong said the Chinese government is reflecting on both the successes and insufficiencies of \"one country, two systems\" to improve its implementation, but that its original mission and principles would remain unchanged.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
