The White House allegedly tried to bury the Trump-Zelensky call\n\nThe whistleblower says the White House went outside the normal process to prevent officials from reviewing the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 the same rough transcript the White House released Wednesday amid pressure.\n\nThe complaint says officials told the whistleblower that they were told to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript.\n\n\u201cAccording to multiple White House officials I spoke with, the transcript of the President\u2019s call with President Zelenskyy was placed into a computer system managed directly by the National Security Council (NSC) Directorate of Intelligence Programs,\u201d the complaint says, noting that it\u2019s an isolated computer system for \u201ccodeword-level intelligence information.\u201d\n\nIt says officials believed this was an abuse of the system because it was done \u201csolely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nThis, notably, would fly in the face of White House claims that its release of the phone call Wednesday was done for transparency reasons and that there was nothing wrong with the call. The call contains no apparent sensitive national security information, yet it was allegedly buried.\n\nThe whistleblower also says they were told this was \u201cnot the first time\u201d something was handled like this.\n\n2. Trump allegedly dangled a meeting with Zelensky as a reward\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about whether military aid was a potential quid pro quo Trump used to encourage Zelensky to launch his chosen investigations, including one involving the Bidens.\n\nThe complaint doesn\u2019t dwell upon that too much, saying it wasn\u2019t clear Ukraine was even aware that aid was being withheld. What it does say is that officials believed Trump dangled a meeting with Zelensky \u2014 something the Ukrainian leader badly wanted \u2014 as a reward to \u201cplay ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring this same time frame, multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired by [former Ukraine prosecutor general Yuriy] Lutsenko and [Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W.] Giuliani.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower clarifies, though that, \u201cI do not know who delivered this message to the Ukrainian leadership, or when.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the whistleblower alleges that Trump also pulled back a planned visit to Ukraine by Vice President Pence for these purposes.\n\n\u201cI learned from U.S. officials that, on or around 14 May, the President instructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration on 20 May; Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the delegation instead,\u201d the complaint alleges. The whistleblower says it was \"'made clear\u2019 to them that the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenkyy \u2018chose to act\u2019 in office.\n\nThe Post has previously reported that Trump has resisted the idea of meeting with Zelensky. But on the July 25 phone call with him, after Zelensky suggests he will pursue the investigations Trump wants, Trump indicates they will plan a meeting in Washington.\n\n\u201cWhenever you would like to come to the White House feel free to call,\u201d Trump says on the call. \u201cGive us a date, and we\u2019ll work that out.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday at the United Nations, Zelensky said in an apparently joking manner of the still-unscheduled meeting: \u201cAnd I want to thank you for invitation to Washington. You invited me, but I think \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. But I think you forgot to tell me the date. But I think in the near future.\u201d\n\n3. Two ambassadors allegedly worked to contain the potential damage\n\nThe whistleblower describes two U.S. officials \u2014 U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u2014 trying to mitigate the potential damage caused by Trump\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cBased on multiple readouts of the meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials,\u201d the whistleblower says, \u201cAmbassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower adds that they were told:\n\n\u2022 that State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d to U.S. national security; and \u2022 that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland during this time period met with members of the new Ukrainian administration and, in addition to discussing policy matters, sought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the one hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other.\n\n4. The whistleblower nailed the July 25 call\n\nWhite House officials and Republicans in Congress are already attacking the credibility of the whistleblower, noting that almost all of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.\n\nBut the whistleblower\u2019s characterization of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call is spot-on according to what we saw in the transcript released by the White House.\n\nThe whistleblower wrote on Aug. 12, long before the call was released Wednesday, that they were told Trump pressured Zelensky to:\n\n\u2022 initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; \u2022 assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike, which initially reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the DNC\u2019s networks in 2016; and \u2022 meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.\n\nThe whistleblower also notes Trump lent his support to Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general, which is also on the call. And they note that Trump only mentioned the two investigations, which is true.\n\nThat suggests they did their homework.\n\n5. Many people around Trump are apparently troubled, and some are allegedly assisting in a coverup\n\nMany of the things described above don\u2019t take place unless, A) Multiple people are involved in the alleged corruption, and B) There are also multiple people raising concerns.\n\nThe whistleblower says that, \u201cOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort.\u201d\n\nThey add that, \u201cin almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another. In addition, a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly.\u201d\n\nThere were \u201capproximately a dozen\u201d White House officials listening to the Zelensky call, according to the complaint, and it describes a concerted effort to keep the rough transcript hidden. They also refer to efforts to communicate to Ukraine that meetings would be dependent upon Zelensky pursuing these investigations that would help Trump personally.\n\nIf there is something wrong here, lots of people were complicit. And by the same token, lots of people seemed to be concerned enough to talk about it and to try and work around the edges to contain the damage.\n\nThis means there are lots of potential witnesses here, and lots of potential hearings ahead in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThis post has been updated", "description": "The 7-page document alleges repeated efforts to pressure Ukraine for specific investigations that would help Trump -- and a whole lot of consternation from top officials.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WO0XJ9Tun36AcIyVj3d8czRK_ck=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPCFCGXAFMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
