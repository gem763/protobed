(Callaghan O'hare/Reuters)\n\nThe gunman who killed seven people and injured 23 others during a shooting rampage in western Texas on Saturday had been fired that day from his job, and he and his employer had both called police after his termination. But state troopers who pulled him over for a traffic violation before the shooting were unaware that he could pose a threat.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that Seth Aaron Ator, 36, had contacted the police and the FBI after he was let go from Journey Oilfield Services. He and his employer called the Odessa Police Department that morning, police said. When police officers arrived at the company\u2019s office, Ator had left.\n\n\u201cBasically, they were complaining on each other\u201d over the firing, Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said. Ator did not make threats of violence.\n\nLater in the day, Ator left a \u201crambling\u201d statement with an FBI tip line but did not make a specific threat, FBI special agent Christopher Combs said during a news conference Monday.\n\nFifteen minutes after the call to the FBI, state troopers with the Texas Department of Public Safety stopped Ator, who was driving a gold-colored sedan, because he failed to signal a turn on the highway.\n\nAtor opened fire on the troopers with an assault-style rifle, striking and injuring one of them, while firing through the rear window of his car. Authorities said Monday that he shouldn\u2019t have had the gun at all.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tweeted Monday that Ator did not go through a background check when obtaining the gun used in the attacks, which were spread across at least 15 crime scenes.\n\nAtor had before failed to pass a check with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System while trying to buy a gun, said John Wester, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent.\n\nYears earlier, Ator had been charged with criminal trespass and evading arrest, according to a public records search. His previous interactions with Odessa police were minor, Gerke said.\n\nFBI investigators completed a search of Ator\u2019s property Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange residence, it is very small,\u201d Combs said. The conditions of the property reflected Ator\u2019s mental state, the agent said: The gunman was \u201con a long spiral going down.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrystal Harris, George Guerrero, and Curtis Patterson light candles in the shape of a cross Sunday to remember those who were killed. (Ben Powell/AP)\n\nTraffic stops, though commonplace, are among the most risky aspects of police work..\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a routine traffic stop,\u201d Gerke said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s was an extreme example of how such stops can turn in an instant. After Ator fired at police, he then drove off, continuing to shoot at pedestrians and motorists in a rampage that lasted more than two hours and covered a stretch of more than 10 miles. Ator at one point hijacked a U.S. Postal Service van, killing 29-year-old mail carrier Mary Granados. While police chased him through the city, he shot at people from the white minivan.\n\nVictims ranged in age from 15 to 57, and the wounded included a 17-month-old. Officers shot and killed the gunman outside a movie theater.\n\n\u201cTraffic stops are always unpredictable, and unfortunately this manifested itself in a desperate individual doing some very desperate and tragic things,\u201d said Thor Eells, director of the National Tactical Officers Association.\n\nThe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that tracks officer deaths, said four officers were shot and killed during traffic stops in 2018. During the same period, five officers were killed in ambushes.\n\n\u201cTraffic stops remain among the most dangerous interactions that officers face,\u201d said Robyn Small, the fund\u2019s public relations director. Small said traffic stops are akin in danger to domestic disturbance calls and executing warrants.\n\nWhat makes traffic stops \u201cinherently dangerous is the unknown,\u201d Eells said. A 911 dispatcher might provide information to officers when they respond to calls, but traffic stops are a type of \u201cofficer-initiated activity\u201d that lacks the benefit of a dispatcher\u2019s knowledge, Eells said.\n\n\u201cThey really have little or no information about the occupant of that vehicle, what might have transpired in that person\u2019s life right before they contacted them,\u201d Eells said. Though officers might run license plate numbers through their mobile computers, it is not normal practice to conduct further checks, in part because the owner of the vehicle might not be the driver, Eells said.\n\nA recent source of uncertainty includes the availability of powerful weapons.\n\n\u201cThe way gun laws have evolved over the years, the risk they face in these encounters go up,\u201d said Darrel Stephens, a former police chief in Charlotte. \u201cThe challenges they have with providing the appropriate response have increased.\u201d\n\nStephen said many police departments supply officers with rifles in their cars \u2014 something that in the past was not common practice \u2014 but an officer must know they are facing a threat before arming themselves with such weapons. The sidearms worn by police who make traffic stops are generally no match for semiautomatic assault-style rifles.\n\n\u201cThere is a disadvantage in that you have a sidearm against a rifle-type weapon, which normally can be fired more accurately over a greater distance,\u201d Eells said. Approaching the vehicle as though the occupant might have a firearm is \u201cjust the safest way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re less polite.\u201d\n\nDuring motor vehicle stops, an average of nine officers were killed and nearly 6,000 were assaulted each year between 1988 and 1997, per a 2001 study conducted by Alisa Smith, a legal studies professor at the University of Central Florida. Smith and her colleague concluded stops were not as risky as they appeared when factoring in the sheer volume of stops.\n\n\u201cAlthough the shooting in Texas is tragic and began during a traffic stop, the limited data on the threat of traffic stops does not demonstrate that they are more dangerous than other interactions,\u201d Smith said.\n\nEach day police pull over approximately 50,000 motorists, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project database, a project that has probed the increased likelihood, per share of the population, that police will stop black drivers over white drivers.\n\nChuck Wexler, director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based think tank, noted officers stopped 19 million drivers in 2015.\n\n\u201cTraffic stops are an everyday piece of police work and rarely lead to the kind of violence such as an active shooter situation,\u201d Wexler said. He added: \u201cWith 300 million guns in this country, police officers approach these situations with a higher degree of care than in most countries.\u201d", "description": "The shooter in a Texas rampage had called police and the FBI after he was fired from his job, but state troopers who stopped him along a west Texas highway didn't know he might pose a threat.", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science", "September At Pm", "Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.
