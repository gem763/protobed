A great guy to whom I owe a lot\u2026\u2019\n\nThe 54-year-old continued: \u2018But no amount of plastic surgery can change the fact his age now begins with a 6 and mine with a 5\u2026\u2019\n\nThere it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon hasn\u2019t shied away from talking about having Botox in the past, with his rather smooth forehead, plump cheeks, lean physique and alarmingly white teeth raising eyebrows (so to speak) earlier this year.\n\nThe X Factor judge has never admitted to going under the knife but has been open about his love of Botox, saying in 2008 that it was as commonplace as brushing your teeth.\n\nHe told Glamour: \u2018To me, Botox is no more unusual than toothpaste. It works, you do it once a year \u2013 who cares?\u2019\n\nSimon turns 60 today (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHowever, he later admitted to overdoing it on the fillers, which smooth out wrinkles by temporarily paralysing muscles \u2013 something that may have contributed to a heavy brow, caused by loss of support from his forehead muscles.\n\nSimon also turned to a \u201821st century facelift\u2019 last year to spruce himself up, opting for a \u2018Silhouette Soft Lift\u2019 from Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, who is nicknamed the Picasso of dermatology.\n\nThe procedure, which costs \u00a32,000, involves sewing a bioplastic-infused thread into the face and tugging it to reduce sagging.\n\nSimon told The Sun: \u2018There\u2019s lots of things you can do now. You don\u2019t just have to stuff your face with filler and Botox.\n\n\u2018It hurts like hell but it gets rid of sun damage and unplugs all the crap. For me now, it\u2019s all about having clean skin. If you have clean skin, you look better.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, after turning to a vegan diet this year which saw him shed 20lbs \u2013 for the sake of his five-year-old son Eric \u2013 Simon may be celebrating one of his healthiest birthdays yet at the age of 60.\n\nHappy birthday, Si!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
