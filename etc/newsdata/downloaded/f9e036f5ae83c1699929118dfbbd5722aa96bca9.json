The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +1.10% rose 2.4 basis points to 2.256%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the U.K. and European negotiators had managed to strike a tentative Brexit deal, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker saying it was a \u201cfair and balanced agreement.\u201d Investors said the breakthrough lowered the chance of the U.K. leaving the EU without a trade deal in hand.\n\nAnalysts still say there are few obstacles left before the agreement is ratified. It\u2019s still unclear if Johnson\u2019s proposal will pass in Parliament under the opposition from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nThe U.K. 10-year government bond yield was up 2.8 basis points to 0.721%, Tradeweb data show.\n\nStock-market futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.20% showed Wall Street was headed for a higher open.\n\nInvestors will handle a raft of U.S. economic data also. Weekly U.S. jobless claims, September\u2019s housing starts, and building permits numbers for last month are all due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, followed by last month\u2019s industrial production figures at 9:15 a.m.\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials could also give clues to the outlook for another rate cut before the end of the year. Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman is due to speak at 2 p.m., and New York Fed President John Williams at 4:20 p.m.\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cA Brexit deal could still have considerable headwinds within U.K. Parliament. Headline risk will certainly be front and center,\u201d wrote Tom di Galoma, managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities.", "description": "U.S. Treasury and British government bond yields rise Thursday after the U.K. reached an eleventh-hour agreement to leave the European Union.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
