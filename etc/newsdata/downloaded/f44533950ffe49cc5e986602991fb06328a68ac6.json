I always think good thoughts.\u201d\n\nCarrasco said he lost five to seven pounds while undergoing treatments. He spent time with his teammates in the clubhouse and began working out at Progressive Field in the weeks before his comeback.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want anybody to feel sorry for him,\u201d Indians manager Terry Francona said. \u201cI think at times he tried to hide that. We tried to explain to him that sometimes that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got friends for, to lean on. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d\n\nCarrasco underwent Tommy John surgery in 2011 and had a non-invasive heart procedure in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I learned is whatever happens, happens for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThe leukemia made me get closer to the people that need help. I can feel those type of people, kids who have the same (condition) that I have. Those kind of kids, I never forget them.\u201d\n\nCarrasco, a key member of Cleveland\u2019s rotation for several years, will pitch in the bullpen the rest of the season. He entered Sunday\u2019s game with the Indians trailing 4-1 and allowed a run, but his fastball was in the mid-90s mph.\n\nCarrasco, who is 4-6 with a 5.05 ERA in 13 appearances with the Indians, pitched five innings over four minor league rehab assignments before being activated.\n\n\u201cWe had talked about the first couple outings trying to get him in games where it\u2019s not bases loaded or a tie game,\u201d Francona said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a ton of innings yet. But the idea is trying to get him in enough where he can help us win and doing it the right way, not overdoing it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carlos Carrasco has never been so happy to be home.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Herrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/indians-carrasco_baseball_25403_c0-113-4200-2561_s1770x1032.jpg?fec56313731e3368999b173dfb019309827ba29c"}
