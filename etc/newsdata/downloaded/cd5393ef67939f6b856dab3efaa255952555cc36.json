We want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL,\u201d the NBC show said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nGillis appeared to take his premature firing in jest, and without apology. \u201cIt feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements, but here we are,\u201d he wrote after the news broke on Twitter Monday. Then\u2014in response to his offer to join the cast of SNL being taken away\u2014Gillis declared that an impossibility: \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I\u2019m honestly grateful for the opportunity,\u201d Gillis wrote, before throwing a jab. \u201cI was always a mad tv guy anyway.\u201d\n\nGillis\u2019 hiring was announced last week, along with comedians Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman. Yang will become SNL\u2019s first East Asian cast member in the show\u2019s history.\n\nDespite deleting all of the videos from his podcast\u2019s YouTube channel and all but the most recent episodes from the internet, multiple clips and videos emerged of Gillis making racist, sexist, and homophobic comments soon after the announcement.\n\nA September 2018 episode of \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast,\u201d which Gillis co-hosts with fellow comic Matt McCusker, shows the comedian mocking Asians. \u201cDamn, Chinatown is fucking nuts,\u201d Gillis says in the clip, before adding, \u201clet the fucking chinks live there.\u201d Gillis and McCusker then mock Asian accents and complain about the \u201cfucking hassle\u201d of ordering food from someone who doesn\u2019t speak English well.\n\nIn a separate appearance on the podcast Live from Shane\u2019s Parent\u2019s Basement, Gillis uses the derogatory phrase \u201cso gay\u201d to describe screaming soldiers at the battle of Gettysburg, then later makes jokes using the offensive words \u201cretard\u201d and \u201cf-ggot.\u201d In the same episode, he describes women who had to disguise themselves as men in order to fight in the war as \u201cflat chested f\u2014ing bitch[es].\u201d\n\nGillis has also aimed his comedy at Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. In May of this year, on a separate appearance on the Real Ass Podcast, the comedian called Yang a \u201cJew c---k.\u201d When Gillis\u2019 previous racist comments about Asians, as well as those directed at the Asian American candidate, surfaced, Yang unexpectedly came out in support of the comic. \u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job,\u201d Yang wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\u201d\n\nGillis later issued a statement about his trove of controversial remarks on Twitter, writing: \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses. I\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometime that requires risks.\u201d\n\nYang shared Gillis\u2019 statement on Twitter, and said he prefers \u201ccomedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots\u201d but is \u201chappy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like.\u201d The dialogue between the two men is apparently not over. After Gillis\u2019 firing, Yang took to Twitter to share that the comedian has reached out to him and the two will be \u201csitting down together soon.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days,\u201d the show said. \u201cThe language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable.\u201d", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568666018/16-cheat-gillis-tease_slfas8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
