REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nAndonovski, a coach in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), takes over from Jill Ellis who, after leading the team to a second back-to-back World Cup title in July, announced that she would step down.\n\n\u201cVlatko is known for his deep understanding of the game, his unmatched preparation and his tactical flexibility,\u201d U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro told reporters at a media conference announcing the appointment.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I can\u2019t imagine a more perfect match than this coach for this team at this moment in time.\u201d\n\nThe Macedonian-born Andonovski, 43, told reporters that qualifying for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic tournament was \u201cfirst thing on the agenda\u201d and that he would mix the team\u2019s deep collection of veteran players in among new prospects.\n\n\u201cWe have a very experienced team \u2013- we have players that have been on the international stage, that have won big games, big tournaments, so we\u2019re going to rely heavily on them, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to expand the roster,\u201d said Andonovski.\n\nA former player himself, Andonovski had served as a head coach in the NWSL since 2013, a stint that included two championships, in 2014 and 2015.\n\nMost recently, he coached Reign FC, working with current U.S. national team member Megan Rapinoe, and taking the team to the league semi-finals, despite losing some players to injury and World Cup competition during the season.\n\nNational team General Manager Kate Markgraf said she had spoken to current and former players during the selection process and that Andonovski\u2019s coaching record \u201cspeaks for itself\u201d.\n\nHe joins the national team during a transformative year, months after the players filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against their governing body.\n\nAsked about the issue of gender pay equity, Andonovski said he was \u201cvery respectful of the drive, of the push that the players have\u201d.\n\nThe team sued U.S. Soccer in March and now awaits a May 2020 trial date after mediation between the two parties fell apart in August.", "description": "Vlatko Andonovski was vaulted into one of the most coveted positions in women's soccer on Monday, taking the helm of the United States women's national team in the wake of their record-extending fourth World Cup victory.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446053958&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S05S", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
