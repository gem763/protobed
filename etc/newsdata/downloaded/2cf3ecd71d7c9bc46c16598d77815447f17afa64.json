National Iranian Oil Tanker Company via WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\n\u201cIran is avoiding haste, carefully examining what has happened and probing facts,\u201d spokesman Ali Rabei was quoted as saying by the official news agency IRNA.\n\n\u201cAn appropriate response will be given to the designers of this cowardly attack, but we will wait until all aspects of the plot are clarified,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tanker Sabiti was apparently hit in Red Sea waters off Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian media have reported, an incident that could stoke friction in a region rattled by attacks on tankers and oil installations since May.\n\nA senior security official said video evidence had provided leads about the incident, the semi-official news agency Fars reported.\n\n\u201cPiracy and mischief on international waterways aimed at making commercial shipping insecure will not go unanswered,\u201d said Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran\u2019s top security body, according to Fars.\n\nLeakage of cargo from the tanker has been stopped as it heads for the Gulf, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr reported.\n\n\u201cThe tanker is heading for Persian Gulf waters and we hope it will enter Iranian waters safely,\u201d Mehr quoted an unnamed official as saying. \u201cThe cargo leakage has stopped.\u201d\n\nThe incident, yet to be independently confirmed, is the latest involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf region, and may ratchet up tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, long-time regional adversaries fighting a proxy war in Yemen, which lies at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n\nThe United States, embroiled in a dispute with Iran over its nuclear plans, has blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June as well as for strikes on Saudi oil sites in September. Tehran has denied having a role in any of them.\n\nSaudi Arabia had no immediate comment on Friday\u2019s reported attack on the Iranian-owned tanker.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the reported incident.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group said it did not have firm evidence about who may have been behind the incident.\n\n\u201cThe proximity of the tanker at the time of the attack to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jeddah port might imply that the missiles could possibly have been launched from the kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnother plausible theory is that it was an Israeli sabotage operation...The purpose would be to disrupt Iranian tanker activity in the Red Sea corridor as it heads towards the Suez Canal. A third possibility would be that the attack was conducted by a terrorist group,\u201d Eurasia said in a statement.\n\nThe Iranian reports offered sometimes diverging accounts. Iranian state-run television, citing the national oil company, said the tanker was hit by missiles while denying a report they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the ship was hit twice, without saying what struck it. State television broadcast images from the Sabiti\u2019s deck saying they were taken after the attack but showing no visible damage. The ship\u2019s hull was not in view.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An undated picture shows the Iranian-owned Sabiti oil tanker sailing in Red Sea.
