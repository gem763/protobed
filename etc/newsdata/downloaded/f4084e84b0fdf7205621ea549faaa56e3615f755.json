(AP) - The Miami Dolphins are off to an awful start in part because they fade at the finish.\n\nMiami has been outscored 81-0 in the second half this season, and the pattern persisted Sunday, when the Dolphins fell to 0-4 by losing to the Los Angeles Chargers, 30-10.\n\nThe Chargers led 17-10 at halftime and scored on their first three possessions of the second half, including a 10\u00bd-minute drive from which Miami never recovered.\n\n\u201cSame sad story,\u201d Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make the necessary adjustments in the second half like the opposite team does, and put ourselves in the best position to be competitive. We know it\u2019s a four-quarter game.\u201d\n\nThree of Miami\u2019s losses have come at home, where sweltering September weather is supposed to give them a big advantage. Instead, it\u2019s the team accustomed to the humidity that\u2019s wilting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of trouble in a lot of areas in the second half,\u201d rookie coach Brian Flores said. \u201cI don\u2019t think is a conditioning issue. I think it\u2019s an execution issue, a coaching issue. We have to coach better to put these guys in better positions. We\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\nPlayers differed on how much coaching might play a role. Cornerback Xavien Howard said not at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not getting the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come out with more energy in the second half. We\u2019ve been in the last two games at halftime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re coming out in the second half flat,\u201d safety Reshad Jones agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why.\u201d\n\nDrake saw a broader problem.\n\n\u201cCan anybody give me a definition of what coming out flat means?\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is the plays are there to be made. Some of us are not making plays. We have to be better collectively as a group, as an organization.\u201d\n\nNot that the Dolphins have dazzled anyone in the first half. Overall they\u2019ve been outscored 163-26, which is the NFL\u2019s worst four-game point differential since at least 1940.\n\nThey\u2019re on pace both to score the fewest points in a 16-game season, and to allow the most.\n\n\u201cThere has been some progress over the first four games,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThese guys work hard. They fight hard. The effort is there. But there are opportunities that we should take.\u201d\n\nAgainst Los Angeles, the Dolphins missed two field goals and still trailed by only a touchdown at halftime while totaling 197 yards.\n\nBut in the second half they gained just 36 yards. The Chargers\u2019 pressure up front took a toll as Josh Rosen threw for 21 yards with an interception and three sacks.\n\n\u201cI definitely made a couple of significant errors in the second half,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThey started to heat up the pressure a little bit. We\u2019re figuring it out, and hopefully we\u2019ll give you a better second half next time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Miami Dolphins are off to an awful start in part because they fade at the finish.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/chargers_dolphins_football_86316_c0-199-4758-2973_s1770x1032.jpg?3915a8b924779879b093ef67ccd65aff960d7e8e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
