During a campaign stop in suburban Dallas Sunday, he told a crowd of about 300 people that President Trump holds responsibility for the mass shooting in El Paso.\n\nO\u2019Rourke spoke to about 300 people outside of Artcentre of Plano and blamed President Trump for the deaths and injuries suffered in El Paso at the hands of a mass murderer. He continued to call for government confiscation of popular weapons like the AR-15. He doesn\u2019t want any half-measures, either, he wants full gun control implemented by the government. His supporters voiced approval of his radical rhetoric by chanting, \u201cHell, yes.\u201d That is the infamous response O\u2019Rourke gave when asked if he supports gun confiscation during the last Democrat debate.\n\n\u201cIf we agree that those have been used as instruments of terror against our fellow human beings, against our kids who are hunted in their classrooms and chased down in the hallways of their schools, we\u2019re going to buy back every single one of those weapons,\u201d he said as the crowd chanted \u201cHell yes.\u201d\n\nBiggest @BetoORourke applause line yet in Collin County: \u201cWe are going to buy back every single one of those [assault weapons], take them off the streets \u2026 and ensure they are never used against us again.\u201d Crowd cheers and breaks out in chants of \u201cHell yes!\u201d \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 15, 2019\n\nLater he called on fellow Democrats to stand firm.\n\n\u201cIf we start in a timid, fearful, apologetic way, we\u2019re going to get the same result that we got in the last 30 years, which is literally, absolutely nothing,\u201d he told reporters after the event. \u201cI understand that there are some who are worried about what the NRA is going to do, what the Republican Party is going to have to say. I\u2019m more concerned about those families who survived these horrific shootings.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t bother to hold deranged murderers responsible for recent mass shootings, including the one in El Paso, but he did single out one person. He lays the blame for the El Paso shooting on President Trump. O\u2019Rourke says it is because of the president\u2019s rhetoric on illegal immigration. Because of the rhetoric, Trump has blood on his hands.\n\n\u201cWhat the president of the United States is doing cannot be more dangerous,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe has the blood of those 22 people in El Paso on his hands.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite the hot take from a failing presidential candidate. The Texas Democrat is more concerned about pushing an open-border agenda than allowing law-abiding Americans to protect themselves.\n\nO\u2019Rourke roughed up another Democrat running for the presidential nomination Sunday. He doesn\u2019t appreciate that Mayor Pete agrees with Biden surrogate Chris Coons, a senator from Delaware, about the wrong-headedness of talking about gun confiscation. Coons and Buttigieg know that extreme rhetoric doesn\u2019t help anyone who may eventually be the challenger to President Trump.\n\nButtigieg was asked on CNN\u2019s State of the Union if he agreed with Coons, that the language wasn\u2019t helpful to candidates running for president. He said yes.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and agreed with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., saying the clip of the former O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement about AR-15s and AK-47s \u201cwill be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cLook, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people not just for universal backgrounds checks, but we have a majority in favor of red-flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something.\u201d Buttigieg went on to say, \u201cWhen even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least are pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hand. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nIn response, O\u2019Rourke told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that Buttigieg\u2019s reasoning is part of the problem. It shows \u201chow screwed up the priorities in Washington, D.C. are.\u201d Essentially he calls out Democrats for upholding the Second Amendment, at least for now. So, in Plano, he told the crowd that he isn\u2019t willing to accept bi-partisan moderation on any issue. He is going full force and reasonable debate be damned.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who hours earlier dinged Buttigieg for trying to triangulate on mandatory buybacks, seemed to be more emphatic/lengthy than usual in Plano on Dems who\u2019ve compromised too much on tough issues > pic.twitter.com/NP2mqaK3Vj \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 15, 2019\n\nIn Plano gaggle, O'Rourke alludes to tiff w/ Buttigieg on guns, saying some rivals are saying McConnell/Trump \"are at least pretending to be interested.\" \"Well, shit, DT & MM pretending to be interested in something that is literally a life-or-death issue\u2026is simply not enough\" \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 15, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke continues to circle the drain as a candidate. He is trying to use mass shootings and calls for gun confiscation in response as his way back up in the polls. It is not working. His extreme views on all subjects don\u2019t play well to regular Americans but he continues to go forward and double down. Even in Texas, his crowds are small now in comparison to previous ones. Three hundred people outside an art center in Plano, Texas? The Dallas area is supposed to be Beto country, so that\u2019s doesn\u2019t bode well for his efforts. He told the crowd he could win Texas in the general election but that assumes he wins the primary. Recent polling indicates Biden is still the top candidate, according to Real Clear Politics. He may be in second place of the poll averages in Texas for the primary right now but Elizabeth Warren is quickly gaining on him. It might be time to dust off the skateboard for the home crowd.", "description": "Doubles down on gun confiscation", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
