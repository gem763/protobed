This was part of an effort to spread 82 games over a longer period of time, reducing the number of back-to-backs and, therefore, injuries and fatigue.\n\nThe Boston Celtics could not have asked for a worse start; not only did they lose 99-102 to their rivals \u2013 Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2013 they lost star forward Gordon Hayward just six minutes into his first game as a Celtic, in what was one of the most horrifying leg injuries in recent memory.\n\nHayward suffered a fractured ankle and broken tibia bone and could miss the entire season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houston Rockets defeated the defending champions Golden State Warriors 122-121 in a thriller. The Rockets are considered one of the few teams with enough firepower to defeat the Warriors, and tonight they showed why.\n\nWarriors\u2019 star forward Kevin Durant appeared to hit a shot at the buzzer to give his team a 123-122 victory, but a review showed that he released the shot 0.1 seconds too late, and the shot was waived off.\n\nEdited by M.
