I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much doubt about that,\u201d Rep. John Yarmuth (KY) told Politico in an interview this week.\n\nRep. Don Beyer (VA) also told Politico that he expects to see Judiciary Committee members begin drafting articles of impeachment after returning from recess.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be people \u2014 the Al Green group writ large \u2014 who want the articles of impeachment by Sept. 15,\u201d he said, referring to the Texas Democrat, who has forced several votes on the issue.\n\nGreen has said he will try for a fourth time to impeach Trump after members return, according to NPR.\n\nBut even as the House Judiciary Committee readies to investigate Trump when Congress returns in a week, a spate of recent reporting shows that dozens of vulnerable Democrats are just not there.\n\nMore than 130 Democrats have come out in support of impeachment in some form, crossing the threshold of half the Democrat caucus. However, more than 100 Democrats either oppose or have not clarified where they stand on impeachment, many of them vulnerable Democrats.\n\nOnly 13 out of 55 Democrats listed as Republican targets by the National Republican Congressional Committee have come out in support of impeachment.\n\nThat includes: Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ); Katie Porter (CA); Harley Rouda (CA); Mike Levin (CA); Jason Crow (CO); Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (FL); Sean Casten (IL); Lauren Underwood (IL); Chris Pappas (NH); Tom Malinowski (NJ); Peter DeFazio (OR); Jennifer Wexton (VA); and Kim Schrier (WA).\n\nFewer than ten out of the 42 Democrats listed in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cfrontline program\u201d \u2014 those most vulnerable in their re-election campaigns \u2014 have come out in support of impeachment, according to Time.\n\nOnly two out of 31 Democrats who won seats in districts carried by Trump in 2016 have come out in support of impeachment: Reps. Lauren Underwood (IL) and Chris Pappas (NH).\n\nAnd an even smaller amount \u2014 one out of 17 Democrats whose seats are listed as \u201ctoss ups\u201d by the Cook Political Report \u2013 have come out for impeachment: Rep. Lauren Underwood (IL).\n\nAmerica Rising, a Republican political action committee, instantly hit Underwood in a blog post titled, \u201cLauren Underwood \u2018Lets Her Community Down\u2019 with Impeachment Support.\u201d It said:\n\nLauren Underwood just pulled an epic flip-flop and now supports impeachment. According to her own words just two weeks ago, Underwood\u2019s support for impeaching President Trump would \u2018look like a power grab\u2019 that \u2018leaves her community behind.\u2019 Underwood is caving to pressure from the far-left and supporting impeachment just to please the most extreme elements in her party.\n\nSo far, dozens of other moderate Democrats have successfully avoided being pinned down on the topic. According to the New York Times:\n\nDespite the efforts of pro-impeachment activist groups to transform August into a Tea Party-style series of grass-roots revolts that might force Democrats of all stripes to throw their support behind impeachment, the groundswell has yet to reach this politically crucial group of lawmakers in Republican-leaning districts. Instead, they are staying cautious and, in some cases, even trying to avoid mentioning the word, and many of their constituents \u2014 even impeachment supporters \u2014 appear willing, at least for now, to tolerate that reluctance.\n\nThe paper reported that although attendees at a recent town hall for Rep. Elissa Slotkin (MI) pressed her on the topic, \u201cthere was little pushback\u201d to her \u201cwait-and-see approach.\u201d\n\nThe Huffington Post also reported that \u201cplenty of members\u201d resisting a call for impeachment are \u201conly facing minimal blowback from voters so far.\u201d\n\nRep. Jared Golden (ME), a freshman elected to a rural district in Maine won by Trump, told a local paper that impeachment is a type of \u201cBS that I think drives the silent majority of Americans absolutely insane,\u201d according to the outlet.\n\nAnd Politico Magazine described in a recent piece titled, \u201cMikie Sherill Is Not Feeling the Pressure,\u201d how the New Jersey congresswoman has resisted calls to back impeachment despite being repeatedly asked about the issue at town hall events across the country.\n\nBut moderates are not out of the clear yet.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that \u201call eyes\u201d will be on members like Slotkin, who had said she will make a decision about impeachment in mid-to-late September.\n\nShe told the Post she will consult other colleagues from similarly moderate districts, whom she calls \u201cthe Gang of 10,\u201d when they have dinner the first night they are back in Washington.\n\nHowever, with only a limited amount of legislative time before the 2020 elections get underway, vulnerable lawmakers will be under pressure to show results before backing impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s toxic to do impeachment when the House hasn\u2019t passed major, bipartisan infrastructure or drug pricing legislation,\u201d a senior Democrat aide associated with the moderate wing of the party told Time.\n\n\u201cThe members who flipped districts red to blue in 2018 campaigned on getting those things done for their constituents. They\u2019re focused on fulfilling those promises and bringing back real results for their districts.\u201d", "description": "Moderate Democrats are so far resisting the call to support impeachment, even as House Judiciary Committee Democrats double down.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/for-pelosi-the-biggest-test-awaits-impeach-or-not-impeach-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
