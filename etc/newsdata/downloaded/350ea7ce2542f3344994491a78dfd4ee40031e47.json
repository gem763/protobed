The Oath Keepers, a right-wing, anti-government militia, retweeted Trump, saying, \"This whole thread is important to read. The term 'civil war' is increasingly on people\u2019s tongue. And not just 'cold civil war'\u2014full-blown 'hot' civil war. Fact is patriots consider the left to be domestic enemies of the Constitution bent on the destruction of the Republic.\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes wrote, \"Here\u2019s the money quote from that thread. This is the truth. This is where we are. We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war. Like in 1859. That\u2019s where we are. And the Right has ZERO trust or respect for anything the left is doing. We see THEM as illegitimate too.\"\n\nThe Oath Keepers have vowed to come to Trump's aid before. Shortly before the 2016 election, when most polls predicted him losing to Hillary Clinton, Trump declared that the only way he would lose is if there were massive voter fraud, and he called on his supporters to police their polling locations. As Vox reported at the time, the group issued a \"call to action\" for its members to \"help prevent criminal vote fraud and attempted criminal voter intimidation on election day.\"\n\nBut while Trump is still beloved by far-right figures like Jeffress and Rhodes, his seeming endorsement of a call to civil war is alienating to some relatively moderate Republicans. Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted, \"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\"", "description": "Donald Trump repeated claims that there will be a civil war if he's removed from office, and anti-government militias agree.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Luke Darb", "Luke Darby", "Adam Rapoport", "The Editors Of Gq", "Ann Givens"], "top_image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5d9241c456b77e0009b6d813/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/GettyImages-1169220709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
