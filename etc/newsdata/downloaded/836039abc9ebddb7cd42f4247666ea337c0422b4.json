These materials are not publicly available, and local publishers are not expected to redevelop study materials, as the curriculum technically has not changed.\n\nThe DBE describes these Scripted Lesson Plans (SLPs) as designed to assist educators to teach \"scientifically accurate, evidence-informed, incremental, age appropriate and culturally appropriate\" sexuality education within the Life Skills and Life Orientation Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) in the classroom.\n\nThese SLPs use a \"human rights approach which allows adolescents and young people to develop appropriate life skills to support healthy choices and promote gender equality\".\n\nRecent news reports based on information from Freedom of Religion South Africa (FOR SA) have revealed what appears to be extracts from these new plans, and include \"graphically explicit\" scenarios, examples of sexual assault, group discussions on the topic of \"private parts\", and more.\n\nMinistry Spokesperson, Hope Mokgathle, told Parent24 the Department was not aware of the leaked curriculum.\n\nWhy SLPs?\n\nThe DBE aims to provide curriculum-based CSE as a way to prevent HIV and STIs infections, unwanted teen pregnancies and school related gender-based violence, with the ultimate aim of keeping children in schools.\n\nThe department reports that programmes like these have resulted in a \"steady decrease in new infections\" amongst adolescent girls and young women (from 2000 to 1300 infections per week) and in unwanted pregnancies (from over 99 000 in 2013 to 82 00 in 2017 pregnancies among learners).\n\nStudents with access to these CSE programmes reportedly adopted \"health seeking behaviour\" such as using contraception and condoms, and getting tested for HIV more frequently.\n\nThe Department maintains that the provision of sexuality education will equip learners with the \"knowledge and life skills that will empower them to make informed decisions and choices to ensure that they live healthy lives and realise their full potential.\"\n\nThe objections\n\nAccording to FOR SA, the development and planned roll out of the new curriculum has been \"mired in controversy and secrecy\", and the religious organisation is calling for parents to object.\n\nThey recommend writing to Parliament, but suggest that mass protest action may become \"critically necessary\" to prevent the potential January 2020 implementation date.\n\nThey also claim that teachers feel \"very uncomfortable delivering the content\" and that \"many parents\" say the type of \"graphic and ideologically-laden content\" used is \"completely inappropriate\".\n\nPresident of the SA Teacher Union (SAOU) Chris Klopper has called the content \"grossly insensitive\" and called for a boycott by teachers who object to the new SLPs.\n\nThe Department has previously addressed many of these concerns, which can be found here and below.\n\nIs it that bad?\n\nIn 2015 a UNESCO funded global review found that CSE was key to gender equality and reproductive health. Exposure to comprehensive sex education led to a reduction of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancies, showing a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours, delaying sexual debut and increasing condom use.\n\nWith South Africa's high rates of GBV, HIV, STIs, teen pregnancy and so on, the addition of comprehensive scripted lesson plans does seem like a good idea. But just how detailed and \"graphic\" the new content actually is, remains to be seen.\n\nMinistry Spokesperson, Hope Mokgathle, told Parent24 the Department was not aware of the 'leaked' curriculum, and the leaked content is of dubious origin.\n\nFOR SA has not responded to calls or mails from Parent24 regarding the origin of the content.\n\nTherefore, judgment must be reserved until the DBE releases the content or calls on parents, teachers and stakeholders to comment.\n\n*This is a developing story\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your opinions on the new curriculum with us, and we could publish your mail.
