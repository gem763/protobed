Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei each have figures in the 80-plus percent range, but no other company that Counterpoint studied was even close. Lenovo and Oppo were below 50 percent, while LG, Vivo, and others were below 20 percent.\n\nSlow updates have been a perpetual problem for Android smartphones. Even flagship phones aren\u2019t guaranteed to be running the latest version of Android out of the box, and updates to new versions tend to arrive slowly, if at all. Unlike iPhones, which tend to get support from Apple for four or more years, even the most expensive Android phones tend to have support fall off after two or three years. Google\u2019s promise of three years of support for Pixel phones makes it a standout.\n\nThe situation has improved over time. Google has made changes to Android that make it easier for manufacturers to deliver timely updates, and it\u2019s begun requiring that popular phones receive a minimum of two years of security updates, which are ultimately more important than feature updates.\n\nStill, as Counterpoint shows, the situation is still bad for most phone manufacturers. Looking at their portfolio has a whole, updates take even longer, with only three phone brands \u2014 Nokia, Lenovo, and Xiaomi \u2014 having half of their portfolio running the latest version of Android a year after its release, according to the study.\n\nMaking all this worse: as Counterpoint points out, people are increasingly hanging onto the phones for longer. As that trend continues, a lack of updates is going to mean more people running outdated versions of Android, missing features and security updates and making life harder for developers who have to code to an even wider variety of devices.", "description": "Nokia-branded phones are getting updated to new versions of Android significantly faster than phones from Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei, or any other major smartphone manufacturer, according to a new...", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kN9re0sFWPDY0CeJJbJvvOFDYOs=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16128249/akrales_190416_3375_0218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
