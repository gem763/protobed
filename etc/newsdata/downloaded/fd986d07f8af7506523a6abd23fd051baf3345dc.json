That would push 2019 to 170 deals, raising about $60 billion. The number would be higher without the recent stock-market volatility that has kept Chinese issuers away after a strong 2018.\n\n\u201cThe calendar is active and we expect this to be the most dollars raised since 2014, and the second best year since the 1990 to 2000 period during the internet bubble,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance.\n\nRead also: WeWork\u2019s IPO would be a bewildering way to waste your money\n\nThe IPO market has performed strongly in the year to date, with the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund IPO, -1.24% up about 31%, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, -0.69% 16% gain and the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s DJIA, -1.08% 12% gain.\n\nPositive returns have been driven by the strong performance of some of the ETF\u2019s member stocks including Roku Inc. ROKU, +3.65%, which has gained more than 400% year to date and Zscaler Inc. ZS, -4.47%, which is up 72%, offsetting the weak performances of Uber UBER, -5.74% and Lyft LYFT, -7.25%, said Smith. Uber is currently trading 31% below its issue price, while Lyft is about 35% below its issue price.\n\nRead now: Uber closes at record low as losses, hiring freeze continue to weigh on stock\n\nRelated: Lyft and Uber are giving investors what they want, which is bad for the rest of us\n\nAmong the bigger deals on tap, teeth-straightening startup SmileDirectClub Inc. said early Tuesday that it is aiming to raise up to $1.29 billion in its IPO by selling 58.5 million shares priced at $19 to $22 a pop. The Nashville-based company will use the proceeds of the deal to pay bonuses, redeem LLC units from pre-IPO investors and to fund a dividend to those investors, with the rest to be spent on general corporate purposes, according to the company\u2019s prospectus. The company is planning to list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \u201cSDC.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Beyond Meat goes public with a bang: 5 things to know about the plant-based meat maker\n\nSmileDirect\u2019s model involves shipping clear aligners directly to customers, whose progress is then monitored remotely by licensed dentists or orthodontists. Customers either go to a so-called SmileShop and get a free 3-D image taken of their teeth or buy a kit online to make an impression of their teeth to mail to SmileDirectClub. A dental professional then reviews the information and prescribes aligners if appropriate.\n\nThat deal is expected to land next week, which may put it ahead of the IPO of WeWork\u2019s parent, The We Co. WE, +0.00%, which will be at least a billion dollars, according to its last filing with the SEC. That sum is likely a placeholder until the company sets terms. The office-space-sharing company is planning to list three classes of stock that carry different voting rights, ensuring that co-Founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann will control most of the voting power once the deal is closed.\n\nAmong the risk factors for that company are its long-term lease commitments of nearly $50 billion and the fact it is still posting significant losses.\n\nRead now: WeWork is going public: 5 things to know about the office-sharing company\n\nPeloton Interactive Inc. PTON, +0.00%, the provider of interactive exercise machines and fitness classes, has said it aims to raise at least $500 million in its IPO. The company sells exercise bikes and treadmills and streams fitness classes to those devices through a touch screen included with the machines. It commands a premium price of thousands of dollars for its fitness bikes and $40 a month for a subscription to its classes, over 40% more than it costs to produce both the hardware and content.\n\nPeloton has more than half a billion dollars in losses since it was formed in 2012, although revenue has doubled to more than $900 million in its fiscal year to end June.\n\nFor more, see: Peloton IPO: Five things to know about the interactive exercise-machine company\n\nMeanwhile, Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. is expected to pursue its planned IPO sometime in the fall, according to Smith. That deal was pushed back after Wanda Sports Group Co.\u2019s WSG, -6.30% July IPO flopped, with the stock down 34% from its issue price.\n\nEndeavor combines a talent agency with the world\u2019s biggest mixed-martial-arts organization, UFC, and a range of other assets. The company is planning to list on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol \u201cEDR.\u201d The company has long-term debt of $4.6 billion and total liabilities of $7 billion, according to its prospectus.\n\n\u201cWanda Sports is its closest peer with a similar business model of owning sports events and media rights,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEndeavor is a challenge for some people. It is a complicated business and highly leveraged.\u201d\n\nFor more, read: Entertainment giant Endeavor is going public: 5 things to know ahead of its IPO\n\nSeparately, Cloudflare, a cloud-based network platform that promises security, enhanced performance of business-critical applications, and \u201celiminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware,\u201d said it plans to offer 35 million shares priced at $10 to $12 each, raising $420 million at the top of that range.\n\nThe company is planning to list on the NYSE, under the ticker symbol \u201cNET.\u201d\n\nRead now: Cloudflare IPO: 5 things to know about the cloud-network platform\n\nRounding out the coming parade of IPOs are 10x Genomics, IGM Biosciences, and Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\n10x Genomics said it plans to offer 9 million shares priced at $31 to $35 each, raising $315 million at the top of that range.
