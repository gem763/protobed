Where and how will we live? What would a post-plastic world be like? And how do we design for a circular economy? These are just some of the questions that will be explored at a major new event on 30 October in London. The inaugural Dezeen Day conference aims to set the global agenda for architecture and design, and will feature talks by leading figures.\n\n\u201cRestorative design\u201d is a phrase used by Paola Antonelli, to describe a new dialogue with nature. Antonelli, who is senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is among the keynote speakers at the event who will be tackling the themes around future design. She will speak about her recent exhibition at the Triennale di Milano, Broken Nature, Design Takes on Human Survival.\n\nFuture materials made from microbes instead of chemicals is one way forward currently being explored by designers. Speaking on the day about how the world may look post-plastic, will be biofabrication designer Natsai Audrey Chieza. She will look at how design and living systems can merge to help address the global issues of climate change and pollution. Her 2017 TED talk addressed how the development of biological ways can lessen the waste created by the fashion industry.\n\nThe day-long conference takes place on the same day as the Dezeen Awards winners party. Now in its second year, the prestigious Dezeen Awards focuses on three sectors, architecture, interiors and design, with an international panel of 75 leading figures as judges, and 36 categories.\n\nJudges are looking for work that is \u2018beautiful, innovative and beneficial\u2019. The shortlist this year ranges from the innovative Helsinki Central Library Oodi by ALA Architects and the bamboo Luum Temple by Co-Lab Design Office, to the Child Studio specialising in interiors and installations, and the Le Cube sculpture and stage in LA by Mana and Scalaplus.\n\nDezeen Day takes place on 30 October, at BFI Southbank in London.
