He misfired on a 50-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 36-yard attempt with 49 seconds remaining before halftime.\n\nThe Bills blocked a 33-yarder in the fourth quarter and Santos later botched a 53-yard field goal as the Titans fell to a 2-3 record this season.\n\nAfter the game, Titans head coach Mike Vrabel voiced his support for Santos despite the four-miss day.\n\n\u201cI have confidence in him,\u201d Vrabel told reporters Sunday. \u201c\u2026 I think we all have a job to do. We like to think that if you make mistakes, we can get them fixed and corrected. This is a guy who\u2019s made some kicks for us.

I feel sorry for my teammates, my coaches and they deserve to win and I have just got to do a better job.\u201d\n\nWith Santos out, league sources told NFL Media the Titans are expected to sign former Chicago Bears kicker Cody Parkey. The team is flying Parkey, who worked out for Tennessee last month, in Monday night and he is expected to sign Tuesday.\n\nIt will mark Parkey\u2019s first shot at redemption after the Bears released him during the off-season following his \u201cdouble doink\u201d miss in the playoffs.\n\nThe Titans also waived offensive lineman David Quessenberry on Monday, according to the team.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans released veteran kicker Cairo Santos after a dismal outing during Sunday\u2019s game against the Buffalo Bills,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
