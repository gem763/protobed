He joined a small group of actors who are 18 years old or younger who have been nominated in the Emmys' 71-year history.\n\nBlack lost during Sunday's 71st Emmy awards, but his \"When They See Us\" costar, Jharrel Jerome, won the prize for best actor in a limited series. At 21 years old, Jerome just missed the cutoff for youngest winners ever.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, who is 15, has been nominated twice for her role as Eleven on the hit Netflix show \"Stranger Things,\" but the series wasn't eligible this year.\n\nIt's rare for the Emmys to nominate young actors, despite the fact that so many child actors have gotten their start on the small screen throughout television history. There have only been 12 actors 18 years of age or younger nominated for an Emmy, and only two actors in that age group have won since the award show began in 1949.\n\nAmanda Luz Henning Santiago contributed reporting on a previous version of this article.\n\nBelow are the youngest Emmy nominees and winners of all time:", "description": "17-year-old Asante Blackk was nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy this year for Netflix's \"When They See Us.\"", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7a57f22e22af16722c27c8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
