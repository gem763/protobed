Mandatory Credit: Paul Rutherford-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it would be easy, Sam Kennedy, also the franchise\u2019s CEO, said Monday at the annual press conference at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cYes, there is a way, but obviously it will be difficult given the nature of their agreements,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThe Red Sox, who in 2018 won their second World Series in the past six years, have been among baseball\u2019s biggest spenders, ultimately the biggest on player salaries the past two seasons.\n\nAnd while the team\u2019s controlling owner, John Henry, said last week that \u201cwe need to be under the CBT,\u201d Kennedy was not so steadfast on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to demonstrate a willingness to go over the CBT,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt is going to be a challenging offseason, but we are going to attack it.\u201d\n\nThe Red Sox currently are without a president of baseball operations, as they fired Dave Dombrowski on Sept. 9.\n\nBetts, the 2018 American League MVP, the MVP runner-up in 2016 and a four-time All-Star, earned $20 million this season on a one-year contract the parties reached to avoid arbitration.\n\nThe outfielder, who turns 27 next week, is expected receive $30 million if he and the Red Sox go to arbitration this time, the final offseason before he could become a free agent. When the Red Sox expressed an interest in a longer-term deal before the season, Betts declined.\n\nBetts hit .295 with 29 home runs and 80 RBIs, coming off his stellar 2018 when he led the majors with both a .346 average and a .640 slugging percentage.\n\nMartinez, who signed a five-year contract with Boston for just under $110 million just before spring training in 2018, could use his player opt-out this winter to test the free agent market again.\n\nMartinez, an outfielder and designated hitter, hit .304 with 36 home runs and 105 RBIs this year, down a bit from his 2018 of .330, 43 homers and a major-league-best 130 RBIs.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Boston Red Sox see a potential route to keeping pricey stars Mookie Betts and J.D.
