She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump\u2019s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it\u2019s almost inevitable\u2026\n\nThe same individual also said that members have been calling Pelosi for advice on the matter while she has been consulting with investigative committee chairs and fellow leaders on next steps. Those conversations have focused on how to force disclosure to Congress about a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that alleges Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine constituted an \u201curgent concern\u201d regarding the nation\u2019s security.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Pelosi-Quietly-Sounding-Out-House-Democrats-About-Whether-To-Impeach-Trump-Officials-Say"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
