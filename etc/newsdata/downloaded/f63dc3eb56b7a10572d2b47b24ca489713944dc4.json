I\u2019ve struggled to understand how people who\u2019ve spent a lifetime chest-beating about patriotism can be so willing to burn liberal democracy to the ground to protect a man they wouldn\u2019t trust to sell them a used car. So I\u2019ve tried to envision a situation in which I might be tempted to do the same.\n\nThere\u2019s no left-wing analogue to Trump in American life, but it\u2019s possible to imagine such a figure. Picture an amalgam of Marianne Williamson and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a charismatic ideologue able to speak to the spiritual hunger of lonely, atomized masses. She enters the Democratic primary to elite mockery, but her rallies are huge and rapturous, and she holds crowds spellbound promising to cleanse America of its demonic legacy of racism and sexism. Her pronouncements are at once shocking and thrilling. She pledges to expropriate investment banks and to turn Mar-a-Lago into a homeless shelter.\n\nAt first Democrats freak out \u2014 her movement seems like a cult \u2014 but she wins the primary, and then the presidency, perhaps with an assist from China. Then she sets about trying to make progressive dreams come true. Stacey Abrams becomes attorney general. Larry Krasner, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney and an icon of criminal justice reform, replaces Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. Declaring a national health emergency, the president takes $3.6 billion from the military and gives it to Planned Parenthood. She orders the government not to do business with any company that advertises on Fox News.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious to all but true believers that the president is unhinged; there\u2019s an increasingly messianic, Jim Jones quality to the revival-like rallies she presides over. She spends a third of her time at her network of wellness centers, bringing much of the government with her and putting tens of millions of dollars into her family\u2019s company. Conservatives scream that she\u2019s a self-dealing demagogue. Deep down, liberals agree, but they love her appointments and don\u2019t want to be tarred as privileged reactionaries. When the president announces a plan to unilaterally naturalize every DACA recipient, what progressive wants to be the one carping about executive overreach?", "description": "It\u2019s not easy to turn your back on political comrades.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/opinion/28goldberg-1/28goldberg-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
