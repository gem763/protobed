Sanders will write about her time in the Trump administration, \u201cincluding the most dramatic and challenging moments,\u201d and describe balancing an \u201call-consuming job\u201d with raising a family.\n\n\u201cFrom Arkansas to the White House and back, I\u2019m excited to tell my story about the challenges of being a working mom at the highest level of American politics, and my role in the historic fight raging between the Trump administration and its critics for the future of our country,\u201d Sanders, who is married and has three young children, said in a statement.\n\nSanders, who stepped down this summer after roughly two years as press secretary, left on good terms with a president known for lashing out at departing officials.\n\nThe high regard of her former boss, who upon her announced departure called her \u201cwonderful\u201d and encouraged her to run for governor in her native Arkansas, was not shared by everyone. Her tenure was marked by a breakdown in regular press briefings and ongoing questions about the administration\u2019s credibility, as well as her own.\n\nAt the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in 2018, comedian Michelle Wolf joked that Sanders \u201cburned facts\u201d to create the \u201cperfect smoky eye.\u201d Sanders, who was at the podium while Wolf made her comments, later said that she hoped the comedian could \u201cfind some of the same happiness that we all have\u201d and that she remained committed to touting the \u201csuccess story\u201d of the administration.\n\nThe book will likely add to speculation that Sanders is planning to run in Arkansas, which votes for a new governor in 2022. Her father, Mike Huckabee, served as the state\u2019s governor from 1996-2007.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has a book deal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/books-sarah_huckabee_sanders_09375_c0-0-2873-1675_s1770x1032.jpg?58dfe64af85101ea6509bf2b54f6da2f082de843", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
