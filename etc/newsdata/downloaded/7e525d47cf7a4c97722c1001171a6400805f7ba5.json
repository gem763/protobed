Former Staffers To Kirsten Gillibrand Brutally Torch Her 2020 Chances", "url": "https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/08/26/staffers-to-gillibrand-lady-please-drop-out-n2552209", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-26", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:20:38.135748+00:00", "text": "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is not getting the nomination. She\u2019s not going to be the next president of the United States. She hasn\u2019t gained any ground in the course of four debates\u2014and some members of her former staff know it. She\u2019s a New York liberal who no one has heard of past the Catskill Mountains up until recently and even then, I doubt many knew of her that could buoy her presidential hopes. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders are the top three\u2014the ones with at least some vestige of a national constituency, especially Sanders and Biden. Gillibrand has that bus tour she took in the rural parts of New York as her claim to why she could beat Trump or something. If you felt that was weak sauce, you\u2019d be right. She\u2019s also failed to advance to the Democratic debate next month (via NBC News):\n\nIn a blow to their hopes of making the debate stage next month, billionaire Tom Steyer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and a number of other presidential candidates missed a chance to advance in a new poll on Monday, just two days before the cutoff. Ten candidates have already qualified for the ABC-sponsored Democratic debate in Houston in September, but Steyer, Gillibrand, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and author Marianne Williamson were hoping some last-minute surveys would push them across the threshold. Now they'll have to hope that new polls come out before Wednesday \u2014 a tall order, especially considering that pollsters often avoid surveying Americans in August, when many people are on vacation. Candidates need four polls showing them at 2 percent or higher and 130,000 unique donors.\n\nYeah, this isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s time to pack it up, says former staffers of the New York Democrat. And they made that aspect known sort of brutally\u2014noting that no one wants to see her on the debate stage. I mean when you look at the numbers, they\u2019re not wrong. This is tough love, maybe (via NY Post):\n\nIt\u2019s time for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s sputtering presidential campaign to call it quits, a friend of hers and two former aides told The Post. \u201cIt would be best if she decided that this was not her time,\u201d said one longtime Gillibrand fundraiser, who claimed the Democratic contender\u2019s well-heeled supporters want her to remain in the US Senate. [\u2026] \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone even wants to see her on the debate stage. Everyone I have talked to finds her performative and obnoxious,\u201d said a former senior staffer in Gillibrand\u2019s Senate office. \u201cShe comes across as an opportunist to the public. I think that\u2019s the biggest problem,\u201d said the staffer, who criticized the candidate\u2019s flip-flopping on guns and immigration. \u201cI think she\u2019ll have to seriously evaluate her campaign and her candidacy if she doesn\u2019t make this debate.\u201d\n\nWell, that time has arrived. It\u2019s now up to the senator to decide whether it\u2019s time to close shop.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:20:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/226/6cd0dc74-c025-497d-9d25-0ad1c5c521d7.png"}
