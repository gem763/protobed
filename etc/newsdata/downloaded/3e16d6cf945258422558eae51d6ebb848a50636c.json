Sign up here.\n\nThe co-founder of China\u2019s SenseTime Group Ltd. was visiting New York to encourage more collaboration with the U.S. on artificial intelligence when he heard the news: The Trump administration had blacklisted his company. So much for more cooperation.\n\nXu Bing, the 29-year-old co-founder, knew SenseTime was at risk given rising tensions between China and the U.S., but the timing took him by surprise. He was spending a few days showing off his latest products and meeting other AI researchers earlier this month when the Commerce Dept. put his company and seven others on its \u201cEntity List,\u201d prohibiting American companies from providing crucial supplies like semiconductors. His phone flooded with calls and emails from worried employees and investors.\n\nSenseTime is emblematic of the clash between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. China is seeking to evolve economically by moving beyond manufacturing into the technology vanguard, with the explicit goal of dominating key fields like AI. Donald Trump\u2019s administration is increasingly adamant about containing China\u2019s rise, arguing that companies like Huawei Technologies Co. steal intellectual property and threaten national security, while startups like SenseTime and Megvii Technology Ltd. are complicit in human rights violations in the country\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\nThe company\u2019s founders are a bit stunned at getting caught in the crossfire. They are mostly academics who decided to commercialize their technology five years ago, drawing attention from both U.S. and China governments because of the applications for surveillance. Now, they plan a shift away from hardware, which requires American chips, to focus on software for facial recognition and other applications. The founders think they can survive the existential threat.\n\n\u201cLong-term, the fundamentals of business are still most important,\u201d says Xu, \u201cso that\u2019s what we will focus on.\u201d\n\nSenseTime, whose $7.5 billion valuation is the highest for an AI startup in the world, is trying to reassure investors, employees and customers. The company said in a statement that it is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d at the blacklisting decision and will seek relief. It emphasized it complies with all laws in local jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cThese are real risks for tech companies in China,\u201d says Crawford Del Prete, president of the market research firm IDC.\n\nSenseTime has been preparing for the worst. The company raised about $2.5 billion last year from investors including Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp. and Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings Pte., according to a person familiar with the matter. That forestalls the need for an initial public offering any time soon. China surveillance giant Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. warned last week that it may lose customers in overseas markets because it was part of the U.S. blacklisting.\n\nMegvii, another AI startup that was blacklisted this month, is pressing ahead with its IPO plans, effectively testing whether investors will take on the risks of a blacklisting. (Megvii also says it\u2019s done nothing wrong and plans to fight the U.S. ban.)\n\nFor SenseTime, the biggest challenge of the Trump move is that it will lose access to U.S. semiconductors, particularly from Nvidia Corp. The chips are incorporated into AI cameras and other hardware SenseTime sells to corporations and government agencies. Without them, SenseTime will be able to market software that customers or resellers can then install on their own cameras or servers -- but not the hardware itself. That will likely cut into growth, given that hardware accounts for about half its revenue. Software sales tend to be higher margin.\n\nSales are likely to triple this year to about $900 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Even though growth is expected to flag, revenue may still double annually for the next three years, the people said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much prepared for the long game,\u201d says Xu Li, chief executive officer of SenseTime and another co-founder.\n\nAll this is a far cry from the company\u2019s debut in 2014. Xu Li was a PhD student in computer science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong when he hit it off with a few other AI academics and they founded SenseTime.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
