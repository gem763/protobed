In their new book, \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice,\u201d they present data showing that in 2018, labor income was taxed at a higher rate than capital income for the first time in modern U.S. history.\n\nThe proximate cause of the shift was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which dramatically slashed taxes on corporate profits and on estates \u2014 both forms of capital income \u2014 according to their analysis. But Saez and Zucman also note that the trend has been decades in the making, driven in large part by the same forces that have pushed billionaires\u2019 tax rates below those of the working class.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom the 1940s to the 1980s, the average tax rate on capital exceeded 40%, while labor paid less than 25%,\" they write. \u201cSince its peak of the 1950s, however, the average capital tax rate has been cut by twenty percentage points. At the same time, labor taxation has risen more than ten points, driven by the upsurge in payroll taxes.\u201d\n\nSaez and Zucman\u2019s findings are controversial in some quarters of the economics field because they upend a number of long-held orthodoxies about the distribution of income and spending in the United States. The differences largely amount to decisions about how to assign various categories of income, wealth and taxation to different segments of the population: Are taxes on corporate profits paid by shareholders, or do they get passed on to workers? Is the earned-income tax credit a reduction in taxes or a transfer of income?\n\nThe debate over Saez and Zucman\u2019s findings underscores that much of our understanding of how the economy works is based on formulas and models built by economists. To fill the data gaps, these models rely on the choices and assumptions of the people who make them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the latter part of the 20th century, many economists \u2014 particularly those who worked closely with lawmakers to craft public policy \u2014 tended to make ideologically conservative, market-oriented assumptions about how the world does and should work. In recent years, however, more economists like Saez and Zucman have started to question those assumptions.\n\nOne of the orthodoxies Saez and Zucman challenge is the idea that the optimal tax rate on capital should be as low as possible \u2014 zero, or even less. Proponents of this idea argue that keeping capital taxes low gives businesses more money to spend, which allows them to hire more workers and pay them better wages, benefiting everyone in the economy.\n\nThis thinking underpins much of the erosion of the capital tax rate that Saez and Zucman observe. It was the driving force behind the dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate ushered in by President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder this line of thinking, you\u2019d expect savings and investment to decline during periods of high capital taxation, and to rise when such taxes are low. But Saez and Zucman didn\u2019t find any evidence of this pattern in the data: \u201cSince 1913,\u201d they write, \u201cthe saving and investment rates have fluctuated around 10% of national income despite enormous variation in capital taxation.\u201d\n\nA more recent piece of evidence also bolsters their conclusion: Proponents of the corporate rate cut in the TCJA promised it would unleash new business investment. But the data so far shows \u201clittle reason to believe the TCJA substantially boosted investment to date,\u201d as economist Jason Furman recently summarized for the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nSaez and Zucman contend that, rather than boost investment in American workers, falling tax rates on capital simply have served to fatten the wallets of corporations and their shareholders. \u201cLess capital taxation means that the wealthy \u2014 who derive most of their income from capital \u2014 can mechanically accumulate more. This feeds a snowball effect: wealth generates income, income that is easily saved at a high rate when capital taxes are low; this saving adds to the existing stock of wealth, which in turn generates more income, and so on.\u201d\n\nOne piece of evidence supporting this argument is the recent surge in wealth inequality. \u201cSince 1980,\u201d Saez and Zucman write, \u201cthe top 1% and the bottom 90% have exchanged their slices of the total wealth pie: what the bottom 90% has lost, the top 1% has gained.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, Americans in the bottom 90 percent derive 85 percent of their income from labor, while those in the top 1 percent get more than half of their income from capital.\n\n\u201cTo capital owners who have prospered,\u201d Saez and Zucman write, \u201cthe tax system has given more. From workers whose wages have stagnated, it has taken more.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The proximate cause of the shift was President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, which dramatically slashed taxes on corporate profits and estates, researchers say.", "authors": ["Christopher Ingraham", "Reporter Covering All Things Data"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OUq3bY8RHXrFfsrdLT5yqD-7gsM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QJEQLPSG5II6RAECCBNEI3IZXA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
