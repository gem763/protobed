As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Not to worry, Nationals fans, the way this World Series is trending, Washington should win the next two games in Houston.\n\nYes, the Astros lead the best-of-seven series 3-2 with Justin Verlander on the mound for Game 6, but the road team has won the first five games of the World Series for just the third time in history.\n\n\"It's been a crazy year for us,\" said Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman. \"So why not have every road team win every game in the World Series?\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nWith the Series shifting back to Houston for Games 6 and 7 starting Tuesday, Nationals fans have a reason to believe \u2014 even with their ace Max Scherzer likely out with an injury for the rest of the series \u2014 that the momentum could change.\n\nThe Astros' 7-1 victory Sunday night marked the first time the road team won the first five games since 1996, when the Atlanta Braves won the first two games against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, only to lose the next three at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The Yankees won Game 6 at home to win the World Series.\n\nAstros center fielder George Springer and shortstop Carlos Correa celebrate the win in Game 5.

The Chicago White Sox won Games 1, 3 and 5 and the Cubs took Games 2 and 4.\n\nThe road team has never won each of the first six games.\n\n\u201cYea, it\u2019s a crazy stat,\" said Nationals pitcher Joe Ross, who started Game 5. \"Hopefully we can finish through with it.\u201d\n\nAnd so is the scoring difference. The Nationals outscored the Astros 17-7 in the first two games at Minute Maid Park last week and Houston outscored Washington 19-3 in the last three games at Nationals Park.\n\n\"I think I would have rather played the last three games on the road, with the outcome,\" said Nationals shortstop Trea Turner.\n\nHome field advantage matters, right?\n\nHistory proves it does when it comes to Game 6 of the World Series. Home teams are 43-24, winning five of the last six.\n\nSaid Nationals manager Dave Martinez: \"We won two games in Houston, we're going back to Houston to play Game 6, and here we go. That's all we've got to do is just worry about Game 6 right now.\"", "description": "The Astros' 7-1 win marked the third time in World Series history that the road team won the first 5 games.
