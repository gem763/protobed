But the new state pension system is based on an individual\u2019s own record of National Insurance contributions, not those of their spouse.\n\n\"When the system changed, this could have disadvantaged women who were expecting to claim based on their husband\u2019s record but suddenly could not do so.\n\n\"As a result, the Government introduced a little-noticed concession which allows any woman reaching state pension under the new rules and who paid the married woman\u2019s stamp at any point in the 35 years before reaching pension age to make a claim based on her husband\u2019s National Insurance record.\"\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCheck your National Insurance record and state pension entitlement.
