That means we\u2019ll soon get a much clearer view of where members stand on the biggest issue facing the country.\n\nThe basic political reality is that the Democratic-controlled House is almost certain to impeach Trump, and the GOP-controlled Senate is highly unlikely to vote to remove him from office. That would take 67 senators, meaning that at least 20 of the 53 Republicans would need to split from Trump for him to be removed.\n\nBut while few Republicans have publicly rebuked Trump\u2019s actions at this point, most of them have been conspicuously silent or cautious during their time back in their states, a sign that many are not eager to defend the president\u2019s actions \u2014 and worried what else might come out.\n\n\"Folks are being careful because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be out there,\u201d said one Republican strategist who\u2019s talked to a number of Senate offices in recent days. \u201cIt\u2019s a pandora\u2019s box. Things keep coming out. If I were a senator, even in a safe seat, I\u2019d be really careful about what I say.\"\n\nPolls show support for impeachment rising, and some have found that a narrow majority of Americans currently back removing Trump from office. But while that creates pressure on swing-state senators facing reelection this fall, most of them have calculated they have a lot more to fear from a fractured base or a primary challenge than they do from standing behind Trump (Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., learned this the hard way.). Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) are so far standing by their man, or bending over backwards to avoid criticizing him.\n\nThe group Trump needs to worry the most about isn\u2019t the handful of swing-state Republicans facing reelection this fall who have their fingers in the political wind. It\u2019s the moderates and institutionalists, some of whom are retiring, and who worry more about the history books than what voters think right now.\n\nSome of them have already shown a willingness to stand up to Trump.\n\nA dozen Republican senators have already split with the White House on an issue many saw as unconstitutional: voting to overturn Trump\u2019s emergency declaration used to raid military funding for his border wall pet project.\n\n\u201cThose are the ones who are definitely independent of the president,\u201d said former Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). \u201cThe old mod squad of my colleagues, like Susan [Collins] and Lisa [Murkowski], are the ones to look at who no matter what who will try to do the right thing. And that may upset the president.\u201d\n\nA dozen Republicans broke with Trump last March: Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Collins (R-Maine), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Murkowski (R-Alaska), Rand Paul (R-Kent.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss). All save Rubio (who didn\u2019t vote) voted the same way when the issue came before them again just a few weeks ago.\n\nMembers of that group have been among the most outspoken critics of Trump\u2019s actions in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden. Romney called Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201ctroubling in the extreme,\u201d and he called public comments asking China and Ukraine to investigate Biden \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nCollins is the only Republican facing a tough reelection who\u2019s been willing to criticize Trump. She called Trump\u2019s call for China\u2019s help \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and promised to take the impeachment process seriously. Murkowski made it clear she was taking the impeachment process seriously and was \u201ctrying to be as educated as I possibly can\u201d about the facts before her. Blunt, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said \u201cputting the facts together on the most recent House allegation is important,\u201d even as he blasted House Democrats for a \u201cpartisan exercise.\u201d\n\nSome of those members have defended the president, however. Lee, Moran, Paul and Wicker lambasted Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort and have dismissed concerns about Trump\u2019s actions. And others took the position that while Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t okay, they also weren\u2019t impeachable. Alexander, who is retiring, called Trump\u2019s actions \u201cinappropriate,\u201d though he said impeachment would be \u201ca mistake.\u201d Portman told reporters that \u201cit\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government with an investigation with a political opponent,\u201d but said it wasn\u2019t an impeachable offense.\n\nSome of the Senate\u2019s other more establishment-minded Republicans should be closely watched as well.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) went from a Never Trump Republican to one who\u2019s been strikingly quiet amidst Trump\u2019s regular scandals. He just got Trump\u2019s endorsement for his 2020 reelection. But he decided that Trump\u2019s call for help from China was a bridge too far.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,\u201d he told the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nRetiring Sens. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) have been notably quiet about their thoughts \u2014 Enzi offered a measured, noncommittal statement and Roberts has stayed silent.\n\nWhile House lawmakers are already staking out their positions. Senators have the luxury of time. They can simply say they\u2019ll wait until all the facts come out, as they\u2019re waiting on the House to do its investigation. But once they return on Tuesday to a crush of reporters and get to sound out one another for the first time after a long stretch at home, we should get a better sense of whether a real number of them are ready to show some spine \u2014 or whether most will just fall in line once they can get on the same page in meetings next week.\n\n\"I just don\u2019t know what kind of a world we\u2019re walking into next Tuesday,\u201d Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP Senate strategist, told VICE News on Friday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to get a lot more reactions next week.\u201d\n\nCover: Sen.
