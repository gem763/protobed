We are committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution.\"\n\nBoth sides declined to comment on details of the discussions, however a source familiar with the talks told CNBC that one of the union's main concerns with the most recent offer was the company's lack of commitment to new products for U.S. plants. Prior to the talks, GM was expected to attempt to negotiate the closure of up to four domestic plants, including large assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan, to address overcapacity.\n\nThe talks, according to the source, have \"cooled considerably\" from the progress that was being made in recent days, including Friday, when the union publicly said \"good progress\" was being made on several issues. While the UAW's rejection of GM's most recent offer could be a setback, the talks continue and neither side has walked away from the table \u2014a positive sign for the negotiations overall.\n\nDittes, in a separate Sunday letter released by the union to GM, said the company \"didn't even have a professional courtesy\" to explain why the UAW's most recent proposal was rejected: \"We expect the Company to respond and discuss the package proposal we presented yesterday,\" he wrote. \"The law and basic decency require no less.\"", "description": "The UAW said the sides will continue to negotiate but the most recent proposal from the company on Sunday morning was inadequate.", "authors": ["Michael Wayland"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106148652-1569430943821rtx74kv9.jpg?v=1569431014", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
