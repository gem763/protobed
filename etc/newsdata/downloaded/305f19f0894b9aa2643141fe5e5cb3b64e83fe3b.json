Trump is contesting the lawsuits.\n\nTrump's failure to disentangle himself from his family business exposes him to inducements by officials and others seeking to curry favor, the lawsuits said.\n\nThe site, a few blocks away from the White House, has attracted protesters and disputes over its restaurants. The hotel has become a known gathering spot for Trump associates, Republicans and others in the president's orbit since he took office in January 2017.\n\nThe Trumps are seeking more than $500 million for the rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that if a sale were completed, Trump's legal team could seek dismissal of the emoluments litigation on mootness grounds. But Tobias said a judge might reject such arguments.\n\nThe Washington hotel has been a moneymaker for Trump. In a financial disclosure form from May, he reported $40.8 million in revenue from the property in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Jan Wolfe; Editing by Dan Grebler and Grant McCool)", "description": "The Trump Organization on Friday said it was exploring a sale of the rights to its Washington hotel, a property at the center of litigation over allegations that President Donald Trump violated anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution.
