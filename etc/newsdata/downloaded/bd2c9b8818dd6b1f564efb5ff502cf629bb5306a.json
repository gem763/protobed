Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it. \u2764\ufe0f\" the actor tweeted, referencing his wife, Mila Kunis, and their two kids, Wyatt and Dimitri.\n\nKutcher, 41, did not give any further details about what the \"snarky\" comments were about. However, he followed up with another tweet, simply writing: \"Life is good -Larry Kutcher.\"\n\nTwitter More\n\nKutcher's comment come the same day that his ex-wife, Demi Moore, released her revealing memoir, Inside Out, which goes into detail about their relationship.\n\nIn the 272-page tell-all, Moore opens up about her marriage to Kutcher, sharing the bad and the ugly and more. The pair got together in 2003 and married in 2005. Eventually, Kutcher filed for divorce in late 2012, finalizing it in 2013.\n\nIn the book, Moore claims that Kutcher cheated on her multiple times. \"He admitted it right away,\" she wrote of the second time he allegedly cheated. Largely due to her marriage to Kutcher, the actress claims her relationship with her children suffered, with none of the three daughters she shared with Bruce speaking to her.\n\n\"The husband who I'd thought was the love of my life had cheated on me and then decided he didn't want to work on our marriage. My children weren't speaking to me... Their father -- a friend I'd counted on for years -- was gone from my life,\" Moore penned in her book. \"The career I'd scrambled to create since I moved out of my mother's apartment when I was sixteen years old was stalled, or maybe it was over for good. Everything I was attached to -- even my health -- had abandoned me. I was getting blinding headaches and losing weight scarily fast. I looked like I felt: destroyed.\"\n\nTheir relationship eventually fell apart when continued struggles with fertility and other issues left Moore feeling \"lost and desperate, confused,\" and she began taking up to 12 Vicodin pills a day.\n\n\"I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me which was the family I had,\" she said during an interview with Good Morning America. \"And I think the weight that it put on Ashton.\"\n\nAdditionally in Moore's memoir, she claimed that she took Jon Cryer's virginity. However, the former Two and a Half Men actor did take to Twitter to deny that she did.\n\n\"Well, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school,\" Cryer tweeted on Tuesday, sharing a link to an article reporting Moore's claim.\n\nWell, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school. https://t.co/amxCUaMUQw \u2014 Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) September 24, 2019\n\nFor more revelations, see below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEverything Demi Moore Says About Her Relationship With Ashton Kutcher\n\nDemi Moore Says She Told Ashton Kutcher About Her New Memoir\n\nDemi Moore Opens Up About Miscarriage and Former Marriage to Ashton Kutcher\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Moore opens up about the bad and the ugly about her relationship with Kutcher in her new book.", "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hKOqSOWuXBgAmSs_ijoQag--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/6aa87bc259910302a82bcdd76698fadd", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
