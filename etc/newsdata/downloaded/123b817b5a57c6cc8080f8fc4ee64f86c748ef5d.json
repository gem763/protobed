Goodenough of the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nGoran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the prize was about \"a rechargeable world.\"\n\nIn a statement, the committee said lithium-ion batteries \"have revolutionized our lives\" \u2014 and the laureates \"laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.\"\n\nThe Nobel committee said the lithium-ion battery has its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s, when Whittingham was working to develop methods aimed at leading to fossil fuel-free energy technologies.\n\nPhysics: Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in space\n\n'Not a crank call': Dr. Gregg Semenza called his mom after winning a Nobel Prize.\n\nThe prizes come with a $918,000 cash award, a gold medal and a diploma that are conferred on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 \u2014 in Stockholm and in Oslo, Norway.\n\nPrize founder Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles won the Physics Prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nAmericans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain's Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\nTwo literature laureates are to be announced Thursday, because last year's award was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nContributing: Jan M.
