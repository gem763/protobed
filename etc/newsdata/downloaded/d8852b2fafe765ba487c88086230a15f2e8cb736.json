Boies: Epstein case brings war of legal titans", "language": "en", "text": "SHARE COPY LINK\n\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes war between two of the country\u2019s most powerful lawyers. Their feud, simmering for years, involves accusations of extortion, surreptitious recordings, unethical conduct and underage sex trafficking.\n\nHarvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz has filed four bar complaints in three states \u2014 all of which have been dismissed \u2014 in a quest to disqualify lawyer David Boies and one of his partners who represent a woman accusing Dershowitz of sexually abusing her when she was underage, newly filed court records show.\n\nThe pugnacious Dershowitz, 80, and the equally zealous Boies, 78, have been sparring for decades. In recent years, both have suffered damage to their storied legacies, making this latest clash between the two legal titans one of the most important of their half-century careers.\n\nDershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and one of the nation\u2019s most iconic civil libertarians, has defended such notorious clients as Claus von Bulow, Mike Tyson and O.J. Simpson. But after four decades of legal accolades, he is now facing a sex scandal and is forced to clear his own name at a time when he\u2019s being confronted by a barrage of attacks on social media as one of the most fervent legal defenders of President Donald Trump.\n\nExplore where you live.

It also reveals new details about an explosive sex trafficking case involving Dershowitz\u2019s former client, Jeffrey Epstein, a New York multimillionaire who, according to investigators, molested more than three dozen girls in Palm Beach in the years 1999 to 2006.\n\nDavid Boies\u2019 fame was cemented by his advocacy in many high-profile cases, including arguing Bush v. Gore in front of the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the Democrat. He has also represented Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, who accused both Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz of having sex with her at Epstein\u2019s direction. Andrew Harrer Bloomberg\n\nDershowitz\u2019s bar complaints against Boies are mentioned in a 36-page filing in federal court in New York Wednesday, as part of a federal civil defamation suit lodged in April against Dershowitz by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre, now 35, has claimed that when she was a minor she was directed to have sex with Dershowitz by Epstein, whom Dershowitz staunchly defended.\n\nDershowitz has repeatedly denied that he had sex with Giuffre \u2014 or anyone other than his wife \u2014 and in June filed a motion to disqualify Boies and his firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, from representing Giuffre in her defamation case. The firm has been representing Giuffre pro bono since 2014.\n\nOn Wednesday, BSF partner Joshua Schiller, son of founding partner Jonathan Schiller, filed papers in federal court in the Southern District of New York opposing the motion to dismiss the firm. The filing includes affidavits by five lawyers who say that Dershowitz either lied or distorted communications he had with them or with Boies involving the Giuffre case.\n\nThe attorneys, most of them current or former BSF partners, submitted the statements in connection with bar complaints filed by Dershowitz. The complaints, filed between 2015 and 2017, include: one in New York against Boies; one in Washington, D.C., against one of Boies\u2019 partners, Sigrid McCawley; and two in Florida \u2014 one against Boies and another against McCawley, who represents Giuffre.\n\nDershowitz, in a statement to the Miami Herald, asserts that the lawyers\u2019 affidavits are suspect since most of the attorneys are either members of Boies\u2019 firm or beholden to Boies.\n\n\u201cAll the lawyers who have filed accusatory affidavits are Boies partners, former partners [who] depend on Boies referrals, or co-counsel with Boies who share contingency fees. None is in any way independent,\u2019\u2019 Dershowitz said in an email Thursday.\n\nAmong the affidavits is one filed by Stanley Pottinger, a former U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights who is now a principal in Edwards Pottinger, a firm in New York and Fort Lauderdale that specializes in sex abuse cases involving women and children.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK\n\nPottinger, who represented Giuffre in 2014, said it was he who enlisted Boies to assist in her case because he predicted that Giuffre would become a target of vicious attacks by powerful and wealthy men she had identified as having sex with her under Epstein\u2019s direction. She needed an aggressive lawyer, one that could stand up to the kind of pressure that they anticipated.\n\nAmong those Pottinger mentions whom Giuffre claimed to have had sex with were Dershowitz and Les Wexner, an Ohio billionaire who is owner of the Limited Brands and Victoria\u2019s Secret clothing stores, according to Pottinger\u2019s affidavit.\n\nTwo other lawyers, Bradley Edwards, a former state prosecutor in Broward County who is now Pottinger\u2019s partner, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge in Utah, were also part of Giuffre\u2019s legal team. Cassell, now a law professor at the University of Utah, is considered a legal expert on and advocate for crime victims\u2019 rights.\n\nPottinger\u2019s affidavit was submitted to the New York bar in 2017 in response to a complaint Dershowitz had filed claiming that Boies and McCawley had a conflict of interest and had committed ethics violations in representing Giuffre.\n\nStanley Pottinger, a former assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division, got David Boies involved in representing Virginia Roberts Giuffre.\n\nThat complaint mirrors his latest motion to dismiss the Boies firm from representing Giuffre in the current defamation case against Dershowitz in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dispute concerns an eight-day period in January 2015 after Dershowitz went on what he called \u201ca media tour\u2019\u2019 in an effort to clear his name and discredit Giuffre and her attorneys. At the time, Dershowitz did not know that Boies was among those representing Giuffre, court records show.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK\n\nEpstein case\n\nIn December 2014, Cassell and Edwards filed an affidavit by Giuffre as part of a federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights complaint they had brought six years earlier against the Justice Department in the Epstein case.\n\nIn the lawsuit, two of Epstein\u2019s victims claimed that federal prosecutors in Florida had improperly brokered a non-prosecution agreement in 2008 with Epstein and his lawyers without informing them, as was required by law. The deal, negotiated by then-Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, was signed and sealed in secret, and by the time Epstein\u2019s victims learned about the deal \u2014 months later \u2014 it was too late for them to object.\n\nEpstein was allowed to plead guilty in state court to two prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where he was given liberal work release, including permission to use his own valet to pick him up at the jail every day and take him to his office in downtown Palm Beach.\n\nEdwards and Cassell argued that the deal was illegal, and in February, a federal judge agreed, affirming that Acosta and other prosecutors violated the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act by misleading Epstein\u2019s victims into believing that prosecutors and the FBI were still investigating the case when they had quietly disposed of it.\n\nGiuffre, who had fled Epstein to live in Australia when she was 19, was among three dozen girls who were listed by the FBI as victims in the case. In 2014, Cassell and Edwards wanted to add more victims to their lawsuit against the government and, that same year, Giuffre agreed to join the lawsuit.\n\nEdwards and Cassell submitted a sworn affidavit in the case, signed by Giuffre, that detailed how she had been recruited into sex trafficking by Epstein and his then-partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre met Maxwell in 2000 when Giuffre was a 16-year-old and working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s winter home and members-only resort in Palm Beach. (Giuffre\u2019s original affidavit claimed that she was 15, but her employment records subsequently showed that she was 16 when she worked at Mar-a-Lago.)\n\nGiuffre\u2019s affidavit set off a media firestorm when she alleged that one of the people she had been trafficked to by Epstein was Dershowitz. This was a loaded document to add to the victims\u2019 case because Dershowitz had represented Epstein in his criminal investigation and helped negotiate the secret non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe deal included a provision giving immunity to Epstein \u2014 and others who were involved in Epstein\u2019s underage sex operation. Many of those co-conspirators have never been identified, and it has given rise to speculation that, if Giuffre\u2019s allegation was true, Dershowitz could have been among those who may have been covered by the immunity provision.\n\nDershowitz denied that he was in any way part of Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking operation, and says he has irrefutable evidence that shows he could not have been involved with Giuffre because he has never met her.\n\nIn January 2015, in a series of interviews on national TV, Dershowitz demanded that Edwards and Cassell be disbarred. He said, among other things, that the lawyers were prepared \u201cto lie, cheat and steal,\u2019\u2019 and had failed to properly investigate Giuffre\u2019s claims before making her affidavit public. He accused Giuffre of being \u201ca serial liar,\u2019\u2019 prostitute and unfit mother.\n\nEdwards and Cassell promptly sued Dershowitz in Broward County for defamation.\n\nOnce a friend of presidents, the ultra-rich and the elite of Wall Street\u2019s bankers \u2014 plus a major benefactor to Harvard University \u2014 Jeffrey Epstein handled portfolios estimated to be worth over $15 billion. Then he became ensnared in a scandal involving the sexual abuse of underage girls. He is seen here, pre-scandal, at left, in conversation with Alan Dershowitz, one of America\u2019s best-known legal experts and a Harvard Law professor emeritus, at a Cambridge event. Dershowitz became a key member of Epstein\u2019s legal team. Rick Friedman Corbis via Getty Images\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2015, Dershowitz appeared on the Today Show discussing the case. After the show, he was contacted by lawyer Carlos Sires, who was a partner in Boies\u2019 law firm and knew Dershowitz. Sires, in an affidavit, said he offered to help in any way he could, but did not know at the time that his firm was already representing Giuffre.\n\n\n\n\n\nSires said he told Dershowitz that he could not represent him until he cleared it with his bosses. For one thing, Sires said, Dershowitz wanted to negotiate the fee that he would be charged, and that wasn\u2019t something that Sires had the authority to approve.\n\n\u201cMr. Sires told Dershowitz that the firm would need to run a conflict check before any potential representation was considered, and that the firm\u2019s chairman, Mr. Boies, would need to decide whether to accept the representation and agree on a fee schedule,\u2019\u2019 wrote Schiller in Wednesday\u2019s response.\n\nEight days later, Sires, after learning that Giuffre was a client of the firm, told Dershowitz he could not represent him for reasons that he could not disclose.\n\n\u201cDarn. I was hoping you could come on board. Thanks for considering it,\u2019\u2019 Dershowitz replied in an email attached to Sires\u2019 affidavit.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret owner accused\n\nDershowitz contends that during that eight-day period, he sent Sires confidential information about his legal strategy and that the firm used that information to help Giuffre\u2019s case. This information would form the basis for Dershowitz to try to remove Boies and any other member of the firm from representing Giuffre.\n\nSuch a move would have been devastating for Giuffre, since it would be unlikely that another firm would take on her case pro bono, setting a terrible legal precedent for other sexual assault victims, Schiller argued.\n\nMoreover, Schiller and Sires claim that Dershowitz did not submit anything to the firm that was not already part of the court record. The firm nevertheless took steps to insulate Dershowitz\u2019s communications with Sires, a legal process that is common, especially among large law firms where potential conflicts can arise between lawyers who unintentionally bump up against clients on opposing sides of a case.\n\nMonths later, Dershowitz reached out to one of the firm\u2019s former partners, David S. Stone, to ask him to get him a meeting with Boies, records show. By then, however, McCawley \u2014 who was based in Fort Lauderdale \u2014 was the lead attorney handling Giuffre\u2019s case.\n\nBoies said, in an affidavit, that he had not returned Dershowitz\u2019s phone calls because he felt that Dershowitz was trying to go around McCawley. But he reluctantly agreed to meet with Dershowitz as a favor to Stone.\n\nOn May 19, 2015, Boies and Stone met with Dershowitz. Stone and other lawyers said that Dershowitz was eager to settle the matter by getting Giuffre to sign a document stating she was mistaken in identifying Dershowitz.\n\nBeyond that, the content and context of those conversations is disputed, with Dershowitz insisting that Boies said he believed that Giuffre was \u201cwrong, all wrong\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and with Boies and Stone saying nothing of the sort was said.\n\n\u201cMr. Dershowitz has asserted that at a meeting on May 19 at which I was present, Mr. Boies stated \u2018[Giuffre] was mistaken in naming me as someone with whom she had sex\u2019 and that if \u2018[Boies] failed to persuade her of that fact, he would leave her representation to Edwards and Cassell and no longer represent her.\u2019 Mr. Boies did not say that on May 19 or at any other time I was present,\u2019\u2019 Stone said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE COPY LINK\n\nBoies, in an affidavit, said he and the other lawyers thoroughly vetted Giuffre and believed she was credible. But as a precaution, Boies asked Giuffre to take a polygraph test, which she passed.\n\nBoies and Dershowitz continued to have phone conversations \u2014 at least two of which Dershowitz acknowledges he recorded without Boies\u2019 permission. It is legal in some states to tape someone without their permission. Dershowitz says he didn\u2019t break the law.\n\n\u201cIf this case comes to trial, a key witness will be David Boies, who told me in a recorded statement that his own client was \u2018wrong ... simply wrong\u2019 in accusing me because it would have been \u2018impossible\u2019 for me to have been in the places where she claims to have met me,\u2019\u2019 Dershowitz said in a statement to the Herald.\n\n\u201cBoies can\u2019t be both a key witness, whose credibility is central to the case, and the key lawyer whose firm is litigating the case. He has no choice but to be a witness as a result of his exculpatory words.\u2019\u2019\n\nBoies said Dershowitz\u2019s recordings were doctored and taken out of context.\n\n\u201cIn June and July 2015, I had two meetings with Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Stone and several telephone calls with Mr. Dershowitz in which Mr. Dershowitz argued that he did not have and could not have had, sex with Ms. Giuffre. After extensive consideration of everything Mr. Dershowitz told and showed me, I ultimately concluded that his denials were not credible,\u2019\u2019 Boies said in a 2017 affidavit.\n\n\u201cEdwards and Cassell settled their defamation claim with Dershowitz in 2015. A judge ordered them to drop Giuffre\u2019s affidavit from the victims\u2019 rights case, and Dershowitz proclaimed victory, even though Boies has said the case was settled in Edwards\u2019 and Cassell\u2019s favor. Giuffre stood by her claims, and nothing in the judge\u2019s statement or the settlement addressed the truth or falsity of her allegations against Dershowitz.\n\nThis widely published photo of Virginia Roberts Giuffre with Prince Andrew bolstered her claim that she was loaned out for sexual purposes to famous men by Jeffrey Epstein. Copy Photo Courtesy of Virginia Roberts\n\nThe lawsuits continued, with Giuffre suing Maxwell in 2015, also for defamation. As part of that case, another woman, Sarah Ransome, came forward, claiming that Epstein and Maxwell also directed her to have sex with Dershowitz against her will when she was 22 years and being trafficked by the couple.\n\nDershowitz by then was accusing Boies and McCawley of extortion, claiming that they were part of the team of lawyers that concocted a plot to extort money from Wexner \u2014 another claim that Boies denies.\n\nWexner, 81, a longtime client of Epstein\u2019s, has not responded to the Herald\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn court papers, Boies has denied there were ever any demands or discussions involving money with Wexner or his lawyers.\n\nA Boies partner based in Miami, Stephen N. Zack, however, said that starting in January 2015 there was a series of conversations and meetings between BSF lawyers and Wexner\u2019s attorneys. Boies personally attended one of those meetings on July 8, 2015, Zack stated in a 2017 affidavit.\n\n\u201cI have read Mr. Dershowitz\u2019s claim that there was a \u2018plot\u2019 and \u2018conspiracy\u201d to extort Mr. Wexner. There was no such \u201cplot\u201d or \u201cconspiracy,\u2019 \u2018\u2019 Zack wrote. \u201cWe requested information from Mr. Wexner\u2019s counsel. At no time in my conversations or in my presence did anyone make any threat or any demand for money or anything else of value from Mr. Wexner or his counsel.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt is unclear what those discussions involved, but Giuffre has not filed any claims against Wexner.\n\nDershowitz has nevertheless continued to publicize his theory about Wexner. In court documents, he has cited another prominent man, Nathan Myhrvold, 55, the former chief of technology of Microsoft.\n\nDershowitz theorizes that Giuffre has mistaken Dershowitz for Myhrvold, because, he says, Myhrvold looks similar. (Myhrvold has red hair, a beard and glasses.)\n\nThe Herald has been unsuccessful in reaching Myhrvold for comment. Myhrvold was among those in Epstein\u2019s circle of prominent friends who often dined at Epstein\u2019s palatial Manhattan home, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article.\n\nWhile Dershowitz publicly urged Giuffre and Boies to sue him for defamation \u2014 saying that he would welcome the case as an opportunity to prove his innocence \u2014 he is now asking the judge to dismiss the complaint, saying the First Amendment gave him the right to defend himself.\n\nFor his part, Boies said that Dershowitz is risking his own credibility, not only in this case, but in the court of public opinion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to take one position publicly and another position in court,\u2019\u2019 Boies said. \u201cEventually, both the public and the court figure out that you\u2019re lying and you lose your credibility in both forums and that\u2019s what he has been doing \u2014 trying to take one position publicly and another in court \u2014 and they are now clashing.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis article has been updated to correct the last name of Elizabeth Holmes.", "description": "Famed Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz\u2019s feud with attorney David Boies is turning ugly.
