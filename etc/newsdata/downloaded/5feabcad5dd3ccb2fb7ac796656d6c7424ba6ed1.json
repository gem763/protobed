And I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"Often, the people who call the most for us to remove content are often the first to complain when its their content that falls on the wrong side of a policy.\u201d\n\nIn his 35-minute speech at Georgetown Thursday afternoon, Zuckerberg elaborated on that defense, saying that having tech company's moderate content could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cPolitical ads on Facebook are more transparent than anywhere else,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe don\u2019t factcheck political ads\u2026 because we believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\n\n\u201cI know many people disagree, but in general I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we are not an outlier here.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said that the company had considered banning political ads all together but rejected that approach.\n\n\u201cPolitical ads can be an important part of voice, especially for local candidates and up and coming challengers that the media might not otherwise cover,\u201d he explained. \u201cBanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg and Facebook have received backlash over their policy, which came under scrutiny this month after President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE\u2019s reelection campaign released an advertisement accusing former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says lawmakers should censure Schiff Schiff says committees will eventually make impeachment inquiry transcripts public Trump threat lacks teeth to block impeachment witnesses MORE \u2014 without evidence \u2014 of using his office to pressure Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into a company where his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee called on Facebook to remove the \"false ad.\" Cable network CNN has refused to run the ad, but Facebook has declined to remove it.\n\nFacebook does have a third-party fact-checking program but for now has exempted posts and ads from political figures from that process. Critics argue that the social media giant is responsible for regulating ads on its platform, which reaches more than 2 billion people globally. But Facebook and free speech advocates say they are wary of giving tech companies authority over vetting political claims.\n\nDemocrats are keeping pressure on Facebook.\n\nBiden\u2019s 2020 contender, Sen.
