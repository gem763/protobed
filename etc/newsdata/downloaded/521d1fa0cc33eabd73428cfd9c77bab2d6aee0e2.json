I wish the NBA would acknowledge that,\u201d Pompeo said during a speech in Nashville.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver further angered China by defending Morey\u2019s right to speak out, but the NBA still pressed ahead with its tour, though in a stripped-down form with every scheduled media or public event cancelled.\n\nThe league said Friday it would be unfair to force the teams to field media questions in China on the \u201ccomplicated and unprecedented situation.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has run into what many other foreign businesses also have learned the hard way \u2014 Beijing demands they respect Chinese political sensibilities if they want access to its huge market.\n\n\u201cBut if you give in (to China) too much, you start to anger your core (US) demographic,\u201d said Mark Dreyer, who runs the China Sports Insider website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a lose-lose for the NBA.\u201d\n\nOn the court, the mood has been more positive, with fans wildly cheering the players, especially Lakers superstar LeBron James.\n\nShenzhen authorities issued a public notice banning provocative banners or gestures at the game.\n\nBut, as in Shanghai, some individuals in Shenzhen expressed their anger at the league.\n\nSome users posted pictures on Chinese social media burning their game tickets outside the venue Saturday, while others arrived in t-shirts bearing messages like \u201cHong Kong, Taiwan, and my soul belong to China.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is expected to largely survive the crisis due to its dominant position as perhaps the most popular sports league in China, where giants billboards showing players like James and Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry are common.\n\n\u201cThere are too many smart people on both sides who will find a way to move past this,\u201d Dreyer said.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 91-77 on Saturday to conclude a pre-season China tour that leaves behind big", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/b111e4_spectators-pre-season-game-los-angeles-lakers-brooklyn-nets-in-shenzhen-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
