Ms. Sanders and a person close Mr. Trump\u2019s son said on Sunday that they did not see the video at the conference.\n\nThe video, which includes the logo for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes. The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael S.
