As evidenced by the fact that I\u2019m writing this, you\u2019re reading it, and Giancarlo Stanton was met with a smattering of boos at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nStanton, who missed all but 18 games in the regular season due to injuries ranging from his biceps to his knee, strained his right quad in the first game of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros. He stayed in the game, homered, and then was out of the starting lineup for Game 2. New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone said that Stanton would stay on the roster for the ALCS and that they hoped he\u2019d be back imminently.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter a day off, the team came home on Tuesday and the 2017 NL MVP was out of the lineup again. The initial prognosis had been overly optimistic. The Yankees, who had won 103 games despite months at a time with key players like Stanton on the IL, would try to win one more without him. I have to assume he was at least as disappointed about this fact as the people who booed him during the pregame introductions.\n\nA few of the most ardent expressers booed again when a between-innings video on the Jumbotron featured a number of different Yankees weighing in on their favorite John Sterling-isms \u2014 including Stanton. (This, while patently absurd, at least shows commitment to ensuring your bleacher neighbors get a second look at whom to avoid after everyone has had a couple beers.)\n\nStory continues\n\nGiancarlo Stanton booed more than most of the Astros. \u2014 Pete Abraham (@PeteAbe) October 15, 2019\n\nLots of Yankees fans didn\u2019t boo. I don\u2019t think there is anything uniquely New York about the ones who did. Or at least, I\u2019m not trying to claim as much by choosing this instance to issue a blanket entreaty: Don\u2019t boo your own team\u2019s players.\n\nThe reason to not do this is because it is both ineffective and an ethical negative, however slight. You don\u2019t have to be polite or even PC in the bleachers \u2014 this isn\u2019t a lecture about declining societal mores or the overly sensitive constitution of millennial players, although it is sure to be interpreted that way \u2014 but booing a player you would otherwise root for because of an unintentional physical failing is so unnecessary, illogical, and so obviously wrong that it hardly bears further consideration.\n\nAnd yet, in case it does:\n\nFirst of all, why is this fun for you? Isn\u2019t the appeal of sports fandom the opportunity to engage in a socially acceptable form of vicarious jingoism? It\u2019s a chance to take pride in the feats of superhuman people you\u2019ve never met in exchange for color-coded loyalty. The biggest fans \u2014 and I have a feeling the boo-ers would say that their vocal disappointment confers a die-hard status more casual observers can\u2019t understand \u2014 use \u201cwe\u201d when talking about the team. But I can assure you, they most certainly aren\u2019t booing each other out there.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s idealism or at least an overstatement to assume sports fandom involves a level of empathy for the actual athletes on the field. But at the very least it\u2019s empathy-adjacent, and the empathy \u2014 imagining your enthusiasm and commitment had something to do with their success \u2014 seems like the good stuff. It\u2019s self-defeating to give all that up to take an adversarial view of the hometown team.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 15: Giancarlo Stanton #27 of the New York Yankees takes the field as he is introduced prior to game three of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros at Yankee Stadium on October 15, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nBeyond that, in this particular instance, what are you even booing? The fibers in his quadriceps that overstretched themselves?\n\nI\u2019m being facetious. They\u2019re protesting his (his) perceived softness, and I guess I just don\u2019t buy that. I don\u2019t buy that Giancarlo Stanton got where he is by looking for excuses to avoid playing baseball. I don\u2019t buy that he rehabbed all year in an effort to be October-ready only to decide that, actually, he\u2019d rather ride the bench this postseason. I don\u2019t buy that he\u2019s refusing to play in the ALCS without reasonable cause or that physical pain isn\u2019t a reasonable cause.\n\nAnd just because you\u2019re convinced the ghost of Derek Jeter would amputate his own arm \u201c127 Hours\u201d-style and stay on the field without even taking a timeout (or issuing an interesting quote about it) is no reason for the Yankees to start someone who is less than 100 percent when the backups have been so competent this season. That\u2019s true regardless of an outcome no one could have known when the decision was made.\n\nMaybe, if it was a contract year.\n\nIf Stanton was in the final few weeks before free agency, it would be reasonable for Yankee fans to feel suspicious that he was saving himself and his health for a bigger payday elsewhere. But Stanton got his payday; he signed a then-record-setting $325 million deal, which the Yankees took on as part of a trade with the Marlins and which keeps him on the team and getting paid through at least 2027. He\u2019s set, even if he shreds his thigh muscle into brisket this season going out in a blaze of glory before being skewered by the tabloids for not providing sufficient long-term return on investment over the next eight seasons.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s that salary, all those guaranteed millions, that makes Stanton fit the pattern of rising-star-turned-disappointing-splurge in the eyes of fans \u2014 whether they have his jersey hanging in their closet at home or not. It can feel like fame and fortune makes someone a fair target for abuse and a fair proxy for venting your frustration about a lack of one or the other in your own life. But, as is so often the case in professional sports, fans forget that the players are analogous to the average employee, who should be encouraged to keep as big a piece of the profit pie as they can wrest away from the (billionaire) owners.\n\nBooing players because their struggles seem especially stark in contrast to a big contract is anti-labor. It perpetuates the oppressive prevailing mindset that the best thing a player can be is both good and cheap, and that if you can have only one, it\u2019s safer to be cheap. An athlete\u2019s production naturally fluctuates \u2014 often due to injury \u2014 and to penalize them for accepting a contract that they earned with their prior performance implies that workers should sympathize with their company\u2019s bottom line above their own financial health. (And also that money is an up-to-the-minute meter of how meritorious you are as a person as opposed to an unfortunately powerful social construct that everyone is always trying to exploit.) Whether or not Giancarlo Stanton is \u201cworth\u201d what the Yankees are paying him this week is not his problem \u2014 nor should it be the fans\u2019.\n\nNone of this, for the record, deals with whether or not you can boo.\n\nYou\u2019re constitutionally allowed to make any sounds you want with your mouth hole. The law, however, does not protect you from other people\u2019s judgement. (This is a universal truth that extends beyond baseball.) So boo all you want, I\u2019m just telling you that the consequences of emanating this particular noise is that people will think you\u2019re a boorish, smug bully.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Booing your own players accomplishes nothing except telling neighboring bleacher dwellers who to avoid.", "authors": ["Hannah Keyser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v7ZsiI02wR8cFXeDzNauGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5R8a19zX6QuB8oCJDVtgRg--~B/aD0yODY3O3c9NDMwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/45262750-efdd-11e9-8cb7-c3dce9d64a94", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
