Why the Scorsese backlash is justified", "language": "en", "text": "Who decides what qualifies as \u201creal cinema\u201d? Martin Scorsese, possessor of perhaps the most potent reputation (as cineaste and film-maker) in Hollywood, has apparently decided that it is him. After describing the Marvel movies as \u201ctheme parks\u201d and \u201cnot cinema\u201d in an interview with Empire published earlier this month, the celebrated director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas doubled down this week at the London film festival, where he is promoting his highly anticipated feature The Irishman.\n\n\u201cWhat has to be protected is the singular experience of experiencing a picture, ideally with an audience,\u201d Scorsese opined. \u201cBut there\u2019s room for so many others now, and so many other ways. There\u2019s going to be crossovers, completely. The value of a film that\u2019s like a theme park film, for example, the Marvel-type pictures, where the theatres become amusement parks, that\u2019s a different experience. I was saying earlier, it\u2019s not cinema, it\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\nTo say that Scorsese\u2019s comments have inspired a furious backlash would be to ignore the reverence in which the Oscar-winner is held by many of those who find his recent comments unpalatable. So let us say merely that there plenty of film-makers out there, most of whom have worked on superhero movies at one time or another, that disagree with him fiercely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christians protest outside a Manhattan cinema, in 1988, at the screening of The Last Temptation of Christ Photograph: Barbara Alper/Getty Images\n\nKevin Smith reminded Scorsese that his own 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ resembles a superhero flick for those who are not religiously minded. Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, currently picking up Oscar buzz for his Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, said simply: \u201cOf course it\u2019s cinema! It\u2019s at the movies,\u201d while Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s James Gunn tweeted: \u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favourite living film-makers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\u201d\n\nThere are a million ways to unpick Scorsese\u2019s argument. For a start, the film-maker\u2019s attempts to label superhero films as corporate entities rather than examples of high art would appear to ignore almost every big-budget, special effects-laden film that has been made since Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws and George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars ushered in the blockbuster era in the mid 1970s. That is to wipe a lot of other people\u2019s filmgoing experiences from the history books, purely on the basis of the director\u2019s own view of film as \u201chuman beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being\u201d.\n\nA more cogent unravelling of Scorsese\u2019s argument can be obtained by examining the film-maker\u2019s own movies, as well as the history of film that the King of Comedy director cherishes so deeply. Let us take for an example 2011\u2019s Hugo, the whimsical Scorsese fantasy set at a railway station in 1930s Paris. The movie is obsessed with the films of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and particularly the French pioneer of early cinema\u2019s classic space fantasy A Trip to the Moon.\n\nIf there was ever a film to evoke a sense of childlike wonder in audiences \u2013 much like comic-book movies, some might say \u2013 it is this one. Astronauts travel to the moon, where they encounter a phantasmagorical lunar landscape of Carrollian mushrooms, cosmic rain showers and bizarre extraterrestrials. There is not much here in the way of narrative sophistication, frankly, and yet this was the film that Scorsese chose as the central pivot in one of his essential arguments within Hugo \u2013 that we need to preserve and celebrate both the history of film and the film-makers that helped make it.\n\nThe director would no doubt point out that M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s work comes from a different place, that it is inspired by magical inner reveries rather than the prospect of selling theme park tickets and toys. But it is hard not to see more than a hint of A Trip to the Moon in films such as Gunn\u2019s own Guardians of the Galaxy 2, in which our heroes head find themselves trapped among the psychedelic flora of Kurt Russell\u2019s Ego the Living Planet.\n\nMoreover, technical innovation itself, as much as storytelling, is surely a valid element of cinema\u2019s capacity to manifest as high art. M\u00e9li\u00e8s hand-painted individual cells to create some of the earliest colour cinematography, while his techniques were extensively copied by the earliest Hollywood film-makers, at a time when the fledgling US film industry was still lagging behind its European counterpart.\n\nMarvel, funnily enough, is known for pioneering the art of digital de-aging, in films such as Captain Marvel and Captain America: Civil War. Those same techniques are now being used by Scorsese himself to deliver younger versions of Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in The Irishman. Would such technologies have ever entered the conversation without the vast funds that the Disney-owned studio has to work with? That scenario seems as unlikely, sadly, as the prospect of Scorsese ever making a superhero film \u2013 though Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker at least teasingly suggests what might have happened if he had ever taken a crack.", "description": "Kevin Smith, Taika Waititi and James Gunn reject veteran film-maker\u2019s dismissal of superhero movies as \u2018theme park\u2019 fare \u2013 while his output exposes a debt to spectacle and innovation", "authors": ["Ben Child"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7daa489781fabe4c0013f424940b8be1552e697b/345_93_3146_1888/master/3146.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=483d5c1de3fcdf33ddb8bc55490330fc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
