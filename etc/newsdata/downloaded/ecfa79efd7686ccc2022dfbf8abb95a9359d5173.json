About only 20 percent of National Security Council staff members are NICE users, one former official said. They can log into the system from their work computers using virtual private network software that limits each of them to using that particular workstation.\n\nWhen NICE users create or upload a new file, they can give only other individual NICE users access to it by name; unlike in TNet, they cannot invite entire groups, the former official said.\n\nIs it an \u201cabuse\u201d to use the NICE system to store a file that is not top-secret code word?\n\nUsing the NICE system to curtail access to the record of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, may very well be, as the whistle-blower also wrote, a sign \u201cthat White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d But calling it an \u201cabuse\u201d appears to be subjective.\n\nGenerally, the national security adviser can decide who can see what files. No rule prohibits putting a file with a lower-level classification into the NICE system in order to take advantage of its greater access restrictions, a former official said.\n\nBy contrast, the official said, it would clearly be an abuse \u2014 violating a specific prohibition in an executive order governing classified information \u2014 to mark something classified at an unjustifiably higher level in order to conceal violations of the law or prevent embarrassment. Here, however, the released call record was merely marked \u201csecret,\u201d the next highest level of classification after top secret.\n\nHow do readouts of head-of-state calls get put together?\n\nAccording to multiple former officials who have helped create the records, the process typically starts with a note-taker who works for the White House Situation Room and monitors the call. The Situation Room uses voice-to-text software to create a rough transcription in real time \u2014 no recording is made \u2014 and then the note-taker takes a first pass at cleaning it up by correcting any obvious garbled moments.\n\nThat draft is then passed to a subject-matter expert on the National Security Council staff who was also listening to the call. That specialist \u2014 who has a greater familiarity of foreign names and places \u2014 edits the record. At the end of the process, the aides give the record to the national security adviser.", "description": "A whistle-blower said advisers improperly restricted access to a record of President Trump\u2019s Ukraine call.
