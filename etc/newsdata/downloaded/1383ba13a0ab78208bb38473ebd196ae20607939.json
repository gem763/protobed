It will be crucial that these programmes are temporary: an economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more.\"\n\nChristian Schulz, Chief UK Economist at Citi, said:\"The UK economy is already around \u00a360 billion smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth.\n\n\"Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth.\n\n\"Brexit no longer \u201cjust\u201d determines future relations with the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner and the transition towards them; it is also intertwined with the political outlook and thus broader economic policies.\"\n\n(Image: Scottish Parliament)\n\n\"Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years.\"\n\nA HM Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cSeptember\u2019s Spending Round supported the people\u2019s priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, the Chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity.\n\n\"In so doing we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.\n\n\u201cThanks to the hard work of the British people over a decade of recovery, we can boost our public services and pursue an ambitious step change in our national infrastructure.\u201d", "description": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said Mr Johnson's spending spree will see the government borrow \u00a350billion next year, leaving its promise not to borrow more than 2% of national income in tatters", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Scottish Parliament"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20382496.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Government-spending-announcements.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
