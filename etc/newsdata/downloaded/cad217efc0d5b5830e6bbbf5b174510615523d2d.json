(Picture: Jack Barnes/BBC)\n\nStacey Slater (Lacey Turner) made an emotional exit from EastEnders back in August and hasn\u2019t been seen on the soap since fleeing Albert Square with Martin Fowler (James Bye), following her attack on Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).\n\nHowever, in coming episodes, we will see Martin make a surprise return to the show following his daughter Bex\u2019s (Jasmine Armfield) suicide attempt. Even though Martin is putting himself at risk of being confronted by Ben (Max Bowden) in the wake of the attack on Phil Mitchell, he resolves to stay in Albert Square for Bex\u2019s sake.\n\nSo, with Martin now back in Blighty, that begs the question: where is Stacey?\n\nWhere is Stacey in EastEnders?\n\nActress Lacey Turner has indeed left EastEnders \u2013 but only temporarily.\n\nThis week, viewers will see Martin lash out at Ben, trying to persuade him to let Stacey (who is currently still on the run in an unknown location) come home. Unfortunately for Martin \u2013 and fans of Lacey \u2013 Stacey Fowler won\u2019t be returning to our screens full time for a little while yet, as the actress is currently on maternity leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLacey, 31, who has been with her partner Matt since they were teenagers and tied the knot with him in 2017, welcomed a baby girl with her husband in July.\n\nLacey Turner is taking time away from the soap to be with her daughter on maternity leave (Picture: Lacey Turner/Instagram)\n\nThe actress has named her daughter Dusty and is currently enjoying her maternity leave with her baby girl, however, Metro.co.uk understands that Lacey did return to film a few scenes for one episode of EastEnders back in August.\n\nAlthough Lacey is not back from maternity leave permanently and will be taking more time off, it is understood that she will appear in one episode before she makes a full-time return at some point later next year.\n\nStacey\u2019s motivation to return to the Square after being on the run is still a secret but with her mum Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) undergoing chemotherapy and her son Arthur still living in Walford, the mum-of-three has plenty of reasons to come back and face her demons \u2013 and Phil.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until November \u2013 when her scenes are set to air \u2013 to find out and see what Stacey is up to.\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays on BBC One at 8pm and on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler returns after daughter Bex\u2019s suicide attempt\n\nMORE: What happened to Bex in EastEnders \u2013 a recap of her suicide storyline\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Stacey Fowler left EastEnders in August and hasn\u2019t been seen on the soap since fleeing Albert Square with Martin following Phil's attack.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRI_78207226_1570461410.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
