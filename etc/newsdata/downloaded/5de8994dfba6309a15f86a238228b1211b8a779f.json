That allowed ailing starters Elena Delle Donne and Ariel Atkins to get a little rest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPhenomenal,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cShatori and A.P. came ready to play. Tianna and Emma gave us big minutes, but that is the depth of our team, and when [Coach Mike Thibault] goes to our bench, that\u2019s what they can do.\u201d\n\nThibault played Meesseman more than 23 minutes and Powers close to 22, opting to sit starting center LaToya Sanders and Atkins, a starting forward, down the stretch as Washington made a final charge to grab an 81-79 lead with 3:59 left.\n\nBut the Mystics would not lead again. The Sun tied it with two free throws and got three-pointers from Jasmine Thomas and Shekinna Stricklen sandwiched around a Meesseman three to make it 87-84. Cloud followed with a driving layup to get the Mystics within one, but they failed to score over the final 2:09.\n\nAD\n\nThe decisive Game 5 is Thursday night at Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have the highest-scoring bench in the league for the season, so we\u2019re used to that,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cThe bench got a whole lot better when Emma came back from overseas. It\u2019s the good and the bad of it. It\u2019s a nice thing as a coach to have a bench that can bail you out and do things. But it\u2019s tough if you have to rely on that as we have a couple times in this series.\u201d\n\nMeesseman and Powers had opportunities in the final minute to put Washington in front.\n\nWith 54 seconds to play, Meesseman got into the lane after collecting a pass from Cloud and was in position for a layup, but the shot clanked off the front of the rim and Stricklen corralled the rebound. It was Meesseman\u2019s seventh and final missed field goal of the game. The two-time all-star finished with 12 points \u2014 all in the second half. She missed all five of her field goal attempts in the first half.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we just changed our way of playing as a team,\u201d Meesseman said of the second-half comeback. \u201cWe moved the ball more. We passed more. We moved more. That\u2019s how I got my open shots that I\u2019m used to.\u201d\n\nTwenty-seven seconds after Meesseman\u2019s missed layup, Powers collected a pass in front of the Connecticut bench with an open look at a three-pointer. But she missed, and Courtney Williams got the rebound for the Sun.\n\nPowers\u2019s 15 points were her most during these playoffs. She had 18 points combined in the first three games of the Finals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good when the ball is dropping, but overall, I didn\u2019t feel good,\u201d Powers said. \u201cOffense is good or whatever, but defensively as a team, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to win, as you saw when we got the stops we got. Even though we got it going offensively, it doesn\u2019t really matter about me scoring at all. As a team, we have to be better on the offensive end and the defensive end.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Mystics:\n\nAD", "description": "Aerial Powers and Emma Meesseman combined for 27 points as Washington erased a huge deficit, but Connecticut held on late to force a decisive Game 5.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XxvN5oCxEBuIdYt3Igs_khWCB3s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MB7EJIHKHYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
