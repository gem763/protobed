What are we going to do with a house?'\n\nScenes from the programme include members of the tribe popping in for tea, taking a tour of the house and being astonished at seeing themselves in a mirror for the first time.\n\nOne user wrote online : 'How on earth did @Channel4 think this was OK?? I'm totally shocked and appalled at #TheBritishTribeNextDoor'\n\nAnother commented: 'Absolute gutter TV as Channel 4 start promoting The British Tribe Next Door. Culturally insulting and exploitative in the highest order.\n\n'Building a house on this tribes' land is bad enough, then add a 'reality star', makes for grotesque TV!'\n\nWhile a third added: ' Like....... Who the f*** decided that this 'show' would be a good idea? Building a British terraced house in the middle of an African village to prove what exactly?'\n\nThe show was criticised as an example of 'poverty porn', with viewers describing it as stereotypical and offensive.\n\nIt was also branded exploitative, with one Twitter user commenting: 'What the hell are Channel 4 execs thinking?The British Tribe next door is a shockingly awful idea -reality TV at its worst. It smacks of colonialism & cultural exploitation & will probably destroy the group who took part. Utterly irresponsible.'\n\nScenes from the programme include members of the tribe popping in for tea, taking a tour of the house and being astonished at seeing themselves in a mirror for the first time\n\nTonight's episode saw Scarlett show tribeswoman around her terraced house, with the guests commenting on how much 'stuff' the Gogglebox star has.\n\nThe Moffatt family had 20,000 possessions moved in, as well as running water and WiFi - with the nomadic Himba tribe forced to watch them enjoying their luxuries.\n\nBut one of the villagers admitted they were excited, saying: 'We will see things we've never seen before.'\n\nAnother commented: 'The height scared me. Who would sleep up there?\n\nScarlett said: 'We have fresh bread and water, but I think our society is full of stress. It'll be really interesting to live with people who live completely differently. I'm just really curious to see what they can offer us and what we can learn form them.\n\n'Most bonkers, bizarre, amazing thing we are ever going to do in our entire lives. I'm sh****** my pants.'\n\nHow we do it: Betty Moffatt introduces a Himba woman to the joys of ironing. The local women wear goatskin skirts, as well as a range of neck pieces and hair styles\n\nDuring the show, the tribeswomen were stunned by the stairs, questioning whether they would fall off them.\n\nThey also asked Scarlett about clothes and why she doesn't dress like them.\n\nThe Gogglebox star refused to take her clothes off and go topless like the tribeswomen, dressing in a swimsuit despite their pleas.\n\nShe said: 'The idea of even walking about in a bikini makes me sick. It makes me ill thinking of people looking and judging. I've always struggled. Even when I was slim, I looked in the mirror and didn't see someone I liked.\n\n'I'm really envious they can walk around with their boobs hanging out.\n\nHowever, Kandiskio, one of the tribeswomen, said: 'I find it very strange for a person to have so many clothes. Scarlett doesn't need so many things. We just own a single stone to put our head on.'\n\nScarlett amazed the women by revealing she had veneers and nail polish.\n\nThey told her: 'You should dress up like us.'\n\nAnd when Scarlett said she was unsure about showing her breasts, the women added: 'Why are you shy about showing your breasts?'\n\nScarlett replied : 'I've been going to start a diet every Monday for about a year now. I think the last time I looked at myself naked in the mirror fully was when I was 18 maybe.'\n\nThe women are insistent though, with Kandiskio and her best friend determined to get Scarlett wearing the Hima clothes.\n\nKandiskio said: 'I think if she wears them, she will feel confident.'\n\nScarlett admitted: 'In our society,I think there's a lot of pressure to have a perfect Barbie figure. Since I was young, I have struggled with body confidence. You always feel like why do people like me and you doubt yourself a lot more.'\n\nThe tribeswomen told the reality TV star that she was scared and lacked confidence, saying that people cover themselves with clothes because they are shy.\n\nHowever, some viewers were more positive towards the show, praising it for its insight into the tribe's life\n\nKandiskio went on to speak to Scarlett, saying: 'I wish I had bigger breasts like yours. I want my tummy fat to roll. Like the creases of my finger. I want what you have.'\n\nScarlett was also stunned when one of the women found a tiny snake in the water hole.\n\nDespite appearing to be the size of a worm, the women told Scarlett: 'It is a very dangerous snake, it kills people.'\n\nScarlett replied: 'I will never take water for granted again, just pouring from the tap.'\n\nHowever, despite the negative reaction, there was some positive responses to the show.\n\nOne user wrote online: 'People are watching this and saying that it's poverty porn. I'd urge you to look a little deeper and you'll realise that this tribe are some of the richest and most liberated people you've probably ever come across.'\n\nAnother commented: 'I think The British Tribe Next Door is going to turn out as one of the most fascinating programmes I have ever seen. It's not insulting to the Namibians, but a total wake up call for us. By the end of it, I bet we'll all look differently at our lives.'", "description": "The British Tribe Next Door sees Scarlett Moffatt and her family move into an exact replica of their County Durham home in Otjeme, a remote village in Namibia.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain", "Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/01/20062836-0-image-a-22_1571790629640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
