Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sanders further back in the single digits with the rest of the pack \u2014 Biden might be able to ride out the storm of the next several months, prevail decisively in the primaries, and mount a strong challenge to Trump that even the smarmiest sewage-spewing campaign couldn\u2019t sink.\n\nBut Biden won\u2019t be able to pull it off. His lead remains, but it\u2019s not enormous. And he and his family are about to face an onslaught of accusations from a cornered master of the art of excrement-slinging. Some of it is bound to stick. When it does, Biden will no longer look like the surest bet to take on the president.\n\nHe will look, instead, like the second coming of Hillary Clinton.
