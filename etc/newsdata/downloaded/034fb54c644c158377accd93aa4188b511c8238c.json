But being lonely is a different thing.\u2019\n\nThe face says it all \u2013 in a good way (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe pair have continued to see each other in the UK (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nHeading to the First Dates Hotel in hope of reconnecting (and ending her dry spell), Ulrika found herself partnered up with 48-year-old Bristolian silver fox Paul on the search for someone to make her laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have a type, but I love sarcasm, I love people taking the p***, I love funny,\u2019 she said, joking that the last time she laughed was \u2018probably about 2005.\u2019\n\nAnd laugh she did with Paul, as the couple discussed everything from the breakdowns of their previous marriages to banana sandwiches.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been learning through the last few years and we all think we\u2019re chasing something,\u2019 Ulrika said.\n\nWhen Paul asked her: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re chasing something?\u2019, the Gladiators presenter quipped back: \u2018No, I can\u2019t run. I run like I\u2019m running for help.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a real catch,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I have arthritis in my hips and a lower back problem.\u2019\n\nAfter an evening of fun, it seems like Ulrika got what she wanted, saying that she could \u2018actually feel some abdominal muscles aching\u2019 from laughter.\n\nSo did the pair keep the romance alive? It seems so, with the final catch up reading: \u2018After hitting it off in Italy, Ulrika and Paul returned home where the laughs keep coming.\u2019\n\nAw, you guys!\n\nFirst Dates Hotel is available for catch-up on Channel 4OD.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
