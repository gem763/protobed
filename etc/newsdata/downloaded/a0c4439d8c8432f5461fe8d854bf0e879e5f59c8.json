Photo: Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, ahead of the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York, some of the world\u2019s fiercest climate activists will raise their collective voice to demand immediate action on the climate catastrophe: young people.\n\nNo one understands the existential threat of climate change better than those who will have to live with its worst effects. The youth-led movement has quickly gained momentum; more than one million students across the world participated in the first-ever youth climate strike, walking out of school to demand that adults take decisive action on the looming environmental crisis. Tomorrow, they will yet again come together to demand that those in power fight for the communities most affected by climate change, work to protect biodiversity and indigenous lands, and pass the Green New Deal.\n\nAs Katie Eder, a 19-year-old executive director of one of the youth-led nonprofits organizing the strike, wrote in an op-ed on CNN, \u201cWe have no time to waste.\u201d\n\nBelow, here\u2019s everything to know about the 2019 Youth Climate Strike.\n\nWho organized the Youth Climate Strike?\n\nEight national youth-led groups organized the event: Earth Uprising, International Youth Council, Youth Climate Strike, Extinction Rebellion, Future Coalition, This Is Zero Hour, the Sunrise Movement, and Earth Guardians. (The movement is also supported by an \u201cadult coalition.\u201d) With these groups\u2019 supports, young people across the country are stepping up to lead their local demonstrations.\n\nWhere are these demonstrations occurring?\n\nYoung people in more than 150 countries have planned to strike, according to the Global Climate Strike\u2019s website. Per the U.S. event\u2019s official website, some of the biggest stateside protests will be in Boston, Chicago, Madison, New York City, Phoenix, and Seattle.\n\nIn New York City, students will walk out of class and meet at Foley Square by 12:30 p.m., and then march to Battery Park for another rally. There, Greta Thunberg, the face of the youth climate movement, will give a speech at 5 p.m.\n\nTo see strikes around the world, visit the Global Climate Strike\u2019s website.\n\nHow many young people are expected to participate?\n\nUSA Today reports that tens of thousands of students are expected to join in their local climate strike, but it\u2019s likely that number will be much higher. At the first Youth Climate Strike, for reference, more than 1.4 million young people around the world reportedly participated.\n\nWill children be penalized for skipping school?\n\nThat depends on where they live. On Monday, New York City became the first city to announce that public-school students could skip class \u2014 a decision that affects 1.1 million kids. \u201cThis completely changes things,\u201d one student told the New York Times.\n\nMost students aren\u2019t so lucky, though. In fact, New York City\u2019s declaration inspired cities across the country to preemptively announce that students who skipped school to join their local protest would not be excused. Some such cities include Seattle and Philadelphia.\n\nWhat are their demands?\n\nNational movement leaders have five main demands:\n\n\u2022 Pass Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey\u2019s Green New Deal, which transform the U.S. economy to fight inequality, as well as fight climate change (for example, it calls for 100 percent green renewable energy by 2030)\n\n\u2022 Restore and protect biodiversity\n\n\u2022 Respect indigenous peoples and lands\n\n\u2022 Implement sustainable agriculture\n\n\u2022 Pursue environmental justice by advocating for communities on the frontlines of poverty and pollution\n\nLocal organizers also have demands specific to their community. In Massachusetts, for example, leaders are calling on Governor Charlie Baker to declare a \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d and for the local government to pass policies that \u201cprioritize workers and communities on the front-lines of poverty and pollution.\u201d\n\nHow can I support the youth climate movement?\n\nThe easiest way to support the strike would be to turn out for an event! (Yes, adults are encouraged to join in, but organizers are asking for adults to \u201cstep back\u201d and listen to young people. That\u2019s one way you can be an \u201cadult ally.\u201d) You could also monetarily support any of the eight national groups organizing the strike, or find ways to support environmental organizations in your community. Simply tweeting about the strike and the organizers\u2019 demands is encouraged, too. (Check out the social-media kit here.)\n\nOr, join in one of the many other climate-related demonstrations planned from the 20th through the 27th, as the strike is just the start of an entire week of global climate action.\n\n\u201cSeptember 20 is only the beginning,\u201d reads the event\u2019s website. \u201cWe must carry this energy to the 2020 elections, and beyond to ensure real, bold action is taken to address the climate crises. This is history in the making, and it\u2019s time we take back the narrative to save our futures.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
