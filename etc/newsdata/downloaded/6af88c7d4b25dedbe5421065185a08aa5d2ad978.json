It could be within 100 miles of that point, which is why the hurricane center uses \u2014 and emphasizes \u2014 a shaded cone of uncertainty.\n\nAnd much of the Florida coast is inside that cone.\n\nHurricane warnings have been issued for parts of the Florida east coast. The center of #Dorian is forecast to track close to east coast of Florida Tuesday into Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/ueMY5jbAbI \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) September 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThis thing is perilously close to the state. I think we should all hope and pray for the best, but we have to prepare that this could have major impacts on the state of Florida,\u201d said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \u201cIf you look at the National Hurricane Center\u2019s current track, I think it ends up within 30 miles of the coast of Florida. Well guess what? You do just a touch of a bump one way or another, and you have a dramatic difference all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nCenter Director Ken Graham is telling residents don\u2019t bet on safety just because his office specific forecast track has the storm just a bit offshore.\n\n\u201cThe cone is so important,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAnd making matters more touch-and-go is that with every new forecast, \u201cwe keep nudging (Dorian\u2019s track) a little bit to the left,\u201d which is closer to the Florida coast, he said.\n\nDorian is a powerful but small hurricane with hurricane-force winds Sunday only extending 29 miles to the west, but they are expecting to grow a bit. That makes forecasting the storm\u2019s path along the coast \u2014 either just off the coast, skirting it or moving inland with a direct hit \u2014 delicate and difficult. Just a few miles west or east makes the difference between devastation and bad but not horrible damage, meteorologists said.\n\n\u201cWhere it doesn\u2019t directly hit, it\u2019s not going to be a huge problem,\u201d Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said.\n\nWith a big, sloppy hurricane \u2014 say 50% larger in size \u2014 all of Florida would be under a serious threat, but that\u2019s not the case, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.\n\nThis is what makes this a nightmare for forecasters, McNoldy said.\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of the small size, close-in track, like Matthew in 2016, and weak steering currents. That means just a smidge of a movement days ahead of time, while Dorian is in the Bahamas, can reverberate and mean a direct hit or not, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nThat can happen just because of the timing of when Dorian\u2019s eyewall collapses and is replaced, which happens normally in storms.\n\nAdding to that problem is Dorian\u2019s slow, almost snail-like pace. What initially looked like a Labor Day storm for the U.S. is now approaching Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting impatient with this,\u201d McNoldy said. Because the threat seems to keep sticking around, it could be a problem getting the right message across, he said.\n\nKlotzbach said he thinks the U.S. East Coast will get \u201cscraped,\u201d but Dorian will stay just offshore, something Maue agrees with.\n\nMaue warns, however, that two days of high waves and heavy storm surge \u2014 the hurricane center is predicting 4 to 7 feet from West Palm Beach north to Cocoa Beach area \u2014 could severely damage Florida\u2019s beaches.\n\nResidents along Florida\u2019s coast are relieved that the forecast, for now, doesn\u2019t have Dorian making landfall in Florida, but are still preparing for the worst.\n\nKevin Browning in Vero Beach has put up hurricane shutters, bought a generator and is stocked with supplies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thanking God, now, that it\u2019s turned a little bit towards the east, but that\u2019s a forecast, and we never know. I\u2019m just praying and trying to make sure that everybody\u2019s safe. I feel for the Bahamas and I\u2019m praying for them, and I thank God it\u2019s not coming directly to us right now.\u201d", "description": "For Florida, just a handful of miles may make a huge difference in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s slow dance with the coast.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ517_dorian_ZG_20190901144449.jpg"}
