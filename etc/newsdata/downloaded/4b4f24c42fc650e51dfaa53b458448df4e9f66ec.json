They said police took at least 28 of their supporters into custody. That number means that more than 1,200 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in London since their protests, over the government\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to act over climate change, were launched last Monday.\n\nAnd those detained include Belgian Princess Esm\u00e9ralda who was taken into a police van for questioning and held for about five hours after she joined a sit-in at Trafalgar Square on Thursday. \u201cThe more people from all sections of society protest, the greater the impact will be,\u201d the 63-year-old said. Other protests launched on Saturday included one by more than 50 healthcare professionals \u2013 wearing scrubs and singing the Extinction Rebellion anthem \u2013 who gathered outside Shell\u2019s headquarters before they marched to Parliament Square. \u201cWe are meeting outside Shell because they are one of the biggest companies involved in the oil and energy industry, and they have real power to decarbonise that industry,\u201d said Alex Turner, 36, a paediatric and emergency doctor from Bristol. \u201cWe are protesting illegal levels of air pollution.\u201d\n\nJulia Simons, 23, a final-year medical student at Cambridge University, said: \u201cOur government has the responsibility to explain [climate science] to its citizens, to understand that if they don\u2019t act radically, that future which I\u2019ve been studying for won\u2019t exist.\u201d Hundreds of protesters remained camped in Trafalgar Square, where police were continuing efforts to remove them and the roadblock they had set up in Westminster.\n\nSimilar protests took place in many other countries. Dutch police arrested 130 activists in Amsterdam after they blocked a bridge in the centre of the city. Some protesters slumped on hammocks hung from pillars supporting the bridge to prevent boats from passing underneath.\n\nIn France, hundreds of activists blocked a route to the national assembly in Paris for several hours but were later dispersed by police. In Brussels, demonstrators occupied the gardens of the royal palace while in Melbourne protesters said they would hold a \u201cspring rebellion\u201d of civil disobedience this week including blocking traffic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Doctors gather to protest in support of Extinction Rebellion in London.

We believe continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful and non-violent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law. We believe it is our moral duty to act now, and we urge other scientists to join us in helping to protect humanity\u2019s only home.\u201d\n\nA former Paralympic cyclist accused of climbing on to the top of a British Airways plane and gluing himself to it appeared in court on Saturday \u2013 and denied causing a public nuisance. James Brown, 55, who is visually impaired, is alleged to have climbed on the aircraft at London City airport on Thursday during the Extinction Rebellion protests. He appeared at Westminster magistrates court where a not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf by his solicitor Raj Chada.\n\nDistrict judge John Zani granted Brown conditional bail, prohibiting him from going within one mile of any airport in the UK.\n\nBrown \u2013 who participated in five Paralympic Games and won two gold medals and a bronze \u2013 told reporters he was \u201crelieved\u201d to be out of custody. \u201cI am not denying what I did, but I was compelled to do what I did because of my concerns for the future of my children,\u201d he added.\n\nThe protest at Billingsgate, the UK\u2019s largest inland fish market, by Extinction Rebellion\u2019s animal rebellion chapter began early on Saturday when protesters blocked the entrance. One demonstrator locked herself to the gate. Police initially tried to prevent the protesters from reaching the market but relented after negotiations, the group said.\n\n\u201cAt London\u2019s Billingsgate market, thousands of fish, stolen daily from their ocean homes, lie dead or dying,\u201d said Kerri Waters, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion. \u201cMany will have suffocated slowly when pulled aboard fishing vessels, while thousands of others remain alive as they\u2019re transported by lorry to the market, where they\u2019ll be gutted or boiled alive.\u201d", "description": "Activists block trade at Billingsgate fish market and target headquarters of energy company Shell to \u2018raise awareness\u2019", "authors": ["Robin Mckie", "Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e7fdf2711f106b888e39c52d35961360bae4fa/0_75_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b670e7bfe6a9f02d367564c2c8d1f7b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
