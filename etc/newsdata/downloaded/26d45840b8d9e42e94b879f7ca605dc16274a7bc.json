Dim the lights. Turn on \u201cDanse Macabre\u201d by Saint-Saens. This is a Halloween story, Washington style. And it\u2019s as scary as it gets.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBeing scared is all about uncertainty.\n\nSo, perhaps the \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d propounded by German theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg can shed light on the calamity which awaits Congress and the Trump Administration this fall as House Democrats sink deeper into their impeachment probe.\n\nThe Heisenberg Principle asserts that it's impossible to know the \"position\" of something while simultaneously studying its movement. Just the mere engagement of evaluating how fast something moves impacts where it is. Heisenberg argued one couldn\u2019t study one phenomenon without affecting the other.\n\nThe same applies to understand where the House stands with impeachment this autumn \u2013 at the same time it tries to fund the government to avoid a shutdown on November 21 \u2013 just as it wrestles with the USMCA, the new trade pact between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\nAll of this is going to hit at once. Therefore, one cannot comment on the state of play with USMCA without weighing where the House stands with impeachment. One can\u2019t judge whether the government might shut down without considering impeachment. One can\u2019t consider the status of the USMCA without knowing if a fight looms over government funding.\n\nNothing exists in a vacuum in Washington. It\u2019s a powerful weave, fused together. And like Heisenberg, we can\u2019t solitarily understand the nature of impeachment, government funding and the USMCA without considering the triumvirate of variables together.\n\nNovember and December could well be a train wreck in Washington. A cataclysm of intergalactic proportions if the government shuts down amid impeachment. Late November is when House Democrats could move to the \"open\" phase of their impeachment inquiry. Transcripts of closed-door depositions may start popping up as the House Judiciary Committee - charged with crafting articles of impeachment - summon witnesses for the blockbuster, public hearings. Meantime, trade talks continue as lawmakers and administration officials try to strike the final language on the USMCA.\n\n\u201cWe hit a couple of bumps,\u201d said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA) early last week about the USMCA. But Neal noted, \u201cwe worked them out.\u201d\n\nIt would be remarkable to have the House advance the USMCA late this year \u2013 just as it was prepping impeachment articles. Ratification of the USMCA fulfills a key campaign promise of President Trump: renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Adoption of the USMCA would also qualify as President Trump\u2019s most significant, bipartisan policy achievement.\n\nBut, the USMCA language isn\u2019t frozen in form yet. Does the volatile Mr. Trump torpedo a potential agreement because of impeachment? Democrats would portray this as a big win. Does he sign off on one approach with the USMCA one day \u2013 then backpedal a few days later, raging at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)? The President\u2019s certainly reversed himself a number of times, on a host of issues, ranging from Syria, to imposing tariffs on Mexico or even ordering airstrikes abroad.\n\nThe possibility of a government shutdown in this scenario hyper-complicates things.\n\nThere could be efforts soon to approve an overall, stopgap spending patch to run the government through late winter or spring if Congress is mired in impeachment. Such a battle plan could fund Washington through a possible vote to impeach the President and a lengthy trial on the Senate floor. But remember one thing: President Trump would have to sign an interim spending bill into law. Otherwise, the government shuts down. There are whispers on Capitol Hill that Mr. Trump could try to hold government funding hostage unless Democrats drop their impeachment inquest. And don\u2019t forget what sparked the big shutdown late last year and early this year: a dispute over the border wall. Congress and the White House haven\u2019t resolved that issue. Fox is told it\u2019s possible President Trump would balk at a \u201cclean\u201d funding extension. It would have to include robust funding for a wall. The old flashpoint is the new flashpoint.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that President Trump could attempt to use government funding as leverage against impeachment. So far, the administration has not demonstrated it has a strong hand to play against impeachment, repeatedly attacking the Democrats on \u201cprocess\u201d grounds.\n\nThe government\u2019s lacked funding on three occasions during President Trump\u2019s watch. The first was a miniature shutdown in early 2018. Mr. Trump believed he prevailed in that one, not agreeing to Democratic demands to protect DACA recipients.\n\nGovernment funding lapsed for just a few hours weeks later after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) balked at another spending accord. The House and Senate resolved that dispute by dawn. Then, there was the monster, 35-day shutdown which started before Christmas and bled into late January. Democrats feel they won that imbroglio, rejecting the President\u2019s push for a border wall.\n\nIf Mr. Trump feels his back is against the wall with impeachment, sources in Congress tell Fox they fear he may go for broke. Prompting a government shutdown to try derail the impeachment inquiry is the equivalent of deploying a political nuclear weapon. No one knows the toll. But the carnage will be high.\n\nIf the government does shutter, an epistemological question will begin to swirl on Capitol Hill: is the impeachment inquiry \u201cessential?\u201d A great debate always descends on the Capitol as to what workers, aides and staff qualify as \u201cessential\u201d during a government shutdown. Congress and each office make the decision as to who and what is essential. But would the Republican-controlled Senate take a dim view of the Democratic House\u2019s impeachment inquiry? Could the Senate demand the House stop impeachment in exchange for forging an agreement on government funding? Is a Senate impeachment trial \u201cessential\u201d during a shutdown?\n\nOne wonders what arguments the administration may make about \u201cLegislative Branch Appropriations.\u201d Funding for Congress is one of the 12 annual bills which run the government. Would the administration try to harness funding for the House by clamping down on impeachment? Would the Republican Senate do the same?\n\nIn other words, this is about as messy as one can imagine. Let your mind run wild. Imagine the devious scenarios which could await this fall. None are pleasant.\n\nWe\u2019re in this spot, because, as Heisenberg would assert, everything is linked. We just can\u2019t look at impeachment outside the scope of the USMCA. We just can\u2019t look at government funding and ignore the consequences of impeachment. It\u2019s all intertwined.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSo that\u2019s the Halloween story. Think you can sleep easy after that one? No bad dreams?
