They\u2019re fun, have cute animals, and are perfect for people who can\u2019t have pets. However, there is a responsible way to get in on this trend, one a cafe in China had to learn the hard way.\n\nPutting cuteness over safety is Cute Pet Games Cafe in Chengdu, Sichuan province, which featured dogs made to look like mini pandas. Six Chow Chows were painted black and white to achieve the look, The Guardian reported. Pandas are very popular in Chengdu, which holds a big portion of China\u2019s panda bear population.\n\nBacklash against the cafe hit after a video that featured the dogs went viral. In it, the owner identified as Mr. Huang said he offered dog-dyeing services to customers for 1,500 yuan ($212). A video posted by the Global Times on Twitter shows the painted dogs in action.\n\nHuang told Honxing News that he treats the animals well and that the dye is imported from Japan and doesn\u2019t harm the dogs. But a vet told Hongxing News that dye is harmful and can damage the dogs\u2019 fur and skin.\n\nTwitter users also criticised the cafe.\n\n\u201cViolating animal rights for personal gain cannot be forgiven,\u201d @CameronRamirezz said.\n\n\"Boycott this business until they stop this rubbish, dogs have very sensitive skin,\" wrote @PatsPat.\n\nOther users are tired of seeing animals being dyed.\n\n\n\nFind Edoardo on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "They\u2019re cute but the dye can damage the dogs\u2019 skin and fur.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db12fcbcc977f008dac7a24/lede/1571894115740-pjimage-25.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
