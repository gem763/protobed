It now has formal diplomatic ties with just 15 nations in all.\n\nWu urged countries including the United States to \"push back strongly\" against China's moves to diminish Taiwan's presence in the Pacific.\n\n\"I certainly don't want to see the Pacific turned into another South China Sea, with us one day all sighing that it is too late for us to do anything,\" Wu said, referring to Chinese moves to build military installations on artificial islands and reefs in the disputed water.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.\n\nDiplomats attending the forum in Taipei include Sandra Oudkirk, U.S. State Department deputy assistant secretary for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\n\nOudkirk's visit has been seen by some analysts and diplomats in Taiwan as an effort to shore up support for Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has come under pressure from Beijing, which includes regular Chinese bomber patrols around the island, since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nTaiwan has accused China of trying to meddle in its upcoming presidential votes in January as Tsai is seeking re-election - an accusation which China denies.\n\nThe United States, which has a fraught relationship with China over trade, defense and technology issues, upholds what is known as the \"one-China\" policy - officially recognising Beijing and not Taipei - while assisting Taiwan.
