While the physical caliphate has been removed, ISIS and al Qaeda remain dangerous forces in Syria and the ongoing Syrian civil war poses significant security and humanitarian risks,\u201d McConnell stated.\n\n\u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d he added. \u201cMajor new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we learned the hard way during the Obama Administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal,\u201d McConnell warned on Monday.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare break between Trump and McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2020 and has centered his campaign strategy on portraying himself as an essential ally to the president in Washington.\n\nBut the disagreement over how to handle the U.S. military presence in Syria and Afghanistan has simmered for months.\n\nThe Senate voted 70 to 26 in February for a resolution McConnell authored warning against a precipitous withdrawal of forces from the region.\n\nOnly four Republicans voted against it: Sens.

The move drew immediate fire Monday from GOP lawmakers, who characterized it as a green light for Turkey to launch combat operations against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces, who have waged the brunt of the fighting against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nTrump said that \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out\u201d and declared \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday warned President Trump against pulling U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_091119gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
