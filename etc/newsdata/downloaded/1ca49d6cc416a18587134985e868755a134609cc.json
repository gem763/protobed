While we can still control its production and clean our beaches, we can hardly do anything to get all kinds of plastic out of oceans and other water bodies.

Guiding a dozen people to see jaguars in their own vast wetland back yard is and always will be a thrill, but scenes like this are not,\u201d Daily Mail quoted Paul as saying.\n\nHe further said that he hopes that the distressing image becomes the \u201cposter child for plastic abuse and its hideous worldwide proliferation.\u201d\n\nPaul Goldstein\n\n\u201cI hope this image shocks people but more importantly I hope it stirs politicians into action as drastic plastic abuse has reached tipping point. Many people are incredibly conscious of this issue now, making huge steps to cut or eradicate their plastic intake, yet these worthy actions will only really matter when governments stop 'bottling brave decisions',\u201d he said.\n\nLike we said, we would not be able to clear our oceans and all the water bodies of all the plastic that is already there, but we can take better, stricter care going forward.", "description": "The war against plastic is ongoing.
