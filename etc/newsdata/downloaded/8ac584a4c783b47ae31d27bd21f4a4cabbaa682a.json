Instead they just accept their insurer's renewal quote, which is likely to be much higher.\n\nThe good news is that comparing car insurance is simple and easy and you can find the best price in less than five minutes.\n\nYou can then compare the quality of the policy and have a idea of the best price to negotiate with your existing insurer, if you want to stay put.\n\nThere are a handful of ways to help reduce your car insurance costs? Whether you are male or female, old or young, follow our ten steps to lower premiums.\n\nThe quick way and easy to save on car insurance We list our ten tips to find the best car insurance deal below - but for a quick money-saver, you should use a comparison site. If you've not done this before, it could save you hundreds of pounds on a renewal quote. This is a simple and easy way to compare prices and while results will broadly be the same across most comparison sites, they may slightly differ, so it is worth checking a couple. Our recommendations of those to try are > Compare the Market > MoneySupermarket > Confused.com Some insurers don't appear on comparison sites and are worth checking directly. The main two are Direct Line and Aviva.\n\nMotoring costs: Use our ten-step plan to lower your car insurance costs\n\n1. Shop around for the best car insurance\n\nThis is the number one way to save on car insurance. Savings of hundreds of pounds can be found if you shop around when you renew your cover.\n\nBe careful though. When shopping around for car insurance, it's important to make sure that you are comparing like-for-like cover. Some policies may seem cheaper, but you may find you don't have the same level of cover when you have to make a claim.\n\nUse an online comparison service to do the hard work for you. Put in your details and check the prices that come up. You can alter the excess that you are willing to pay and the mileage you will drive and get new quotes.\n\nTry the sites listed in our quick check box above: Compare the Market, MoneySupermarket and Confused.com.\n\nAlso check the insurers that don't feature in comparison sites, the big two are Direct Line and Aviva. It is also worth checking Admiral separately for its Multicar offers if you are looking to insure more than one vehicle.\n\nIf you've been happy with the cover your existing provider has given until now but are unhappy with their renewal quote, let them know the best offer you have received from a rival insurer and ask them to at least match it. Comparing prices is essential to finding this information.\n\n2. Don't put everyone on your policy\n\nEnsure that only regular drivers are named on the policy. You can always add someone for a few days when they really need to drive the car.\n\n3. Protect that no-claims bonus\n\nA long no-claims bonus is the single best way of cutting car insurance costs, so protect it.\n\nThis may increase the premium by a few pounds, but this fades into insignificance against the potential loss of a 90 per cent discount on a premium of several hundred pounds.\n\nBut the definition of a protected no-claims bonus can vary widely between insurers.\n\nThough accidents caused by another driver will normally have no impact on such a bonus, those caused by the insured could. The key is to always check the policy carefully.\n\n4. Increase your voluntary excess\n\nAgreeing to pay more towards the cost of any accident repairs will bring down premiums. If you are not at fault in an accident, the excess can be recovered. Beware being tempted to allow it to rise too high, however, especially if you have a lower value car.\n\n5. Secure your car\n\nFitting an approved alarm, immobiliser or tracking device can attract a discount of around 5 per cent. Many newer cars will come with these as standard, so make sure you check if you have them and then declare them.\n\nEXTRA TRICKS TO CUT THE CAR INSURANCE BURDEN Don't forget to haggle! The car insurance market is notoriously competitive. Once you've been on This Is Money's comparison and found your cheapest price (below), get on the phone and start bargaining! Avoid paying monthly charges: D irect debit instalments generally come hand-in-hand with high interest rates. An alternative is to borrow the money on a 0 per cent purchase credit card and then clear it within a year. [ Check the best 0% purchase credit cards here ] Think outside the box: An accelerated no-claim s bonus, such as the Bonus Accelerator from Admiral , could give you a year's no claims bonus after just 1 0 months. Named drivers and friends and family: If you have previously been insured as an additional driver on another policy, see if you can transfer a no claims bonus to your own insurance coverage. So me insurers do this, including The AA and Direct Line . Try for a discount by insuring two or more vehicles between friends or family members with the same firm.\n\nNo claims discount: It could be worth paying extra to protect yours\n\n6. Do fewer miles\n\nReduced mileage equates to a greater saving.\n\nFor example, a reduction in annual mileage of 5,000 miles could save a typical 35-year-old driver about \u00a350 a year in premiums.\n\nA cut of 10,000 miles a year could save more than \u00a3100.\n\nBut you must be honest about your annual mileage, as inaccuracy will jeopardise any claim.\n\nCheck your use cover - if you don't use your car to drive to work or for business - both things that increase your premium - you may be able to get a cheaper rate.\n\n7. Think carefully about adding young drivers\n\nAdding a young, inexperienced driver to your policy can be a false economy, especially if you have a large or higher powered vehicle.\n\nThe premium will still be affected by the youngest driver and he or she may not have a no-claims bonus. Insurers have also been cracking down on fronting, where parents insure cars in their name for children to cut costs, so make sure if you are the policyholder on a car driven by your children that you are actually its main driver, or that you declare otherwise.\n\n8. Watch out for insurance trap cars\n\nIf you decide to change your car, check with your insurer if the model will have a significant effect on the premium.\n\nSporty cars can attract a high premium and often a slightly different model or smaller engine can make a big difference in your favour. It will also probably save you on petrol too!\n\nBe aware that Insurers will try to include administration fees for changes to a policy mid-term. This fee, usually between \u00a325 and \u00a350, will be added if you change a vehicle or your home address.\n\nHowever, you can ask for the fee to be waived if it is a minor adaptation, such as changing to a personalised registration number.\n\n9. Remember what the garage is for\n\nIf your garage is full of junk, clear it out and use it for your car.\n\nInsurers like cars kept in garages overnight and this can dramatically cut your premium.\n\nAside from the benefit of not having to scrape the ice off in winter, there is a higher risk of theft by keeping the car on the road, so keeping it in the garage will be reflected in your premium.\n\n10. Be a better driver and sign up to a blackbox\n\nBlackbox policies, where the insurer installs a system in your car to monitor your driving, reward those who drive carefully.\n\nOfficially called telematics, these check your speed, how aggressive you accelerate and brake and how cautiously you drive, and also whether you are on the road at perceived dangerous times - i.e. the early hours of the morning.\n\nThey can cut premiums substantially once you start proving you are a good driver. The biggest win is for those whose premiums are high, especially young drivers.\n\nSome insurers even offer an up front discount if you take out a telematics policy.\n\nWomen and cheaper insurance The EU ruled that finance companies can no longer consider your gender when deciding what to charge you. This was triggered by a European Court of Justice ruling on a challenge by a Belgian consumer group. Its case was that the exemption for insurers contradicted the principle of gender equality. The ban came into force on 21 December 2012, after fierce campaign for UK firms which argued that they were not discriminating between the sexes \u2014 but instead were basing their prices on statistics. Their argument was that as women live longer they pay less for life insurance, and get cheaper car cover because they have fewer accidents. The move to so-called gender-neutral pricing will affect premiums for all types of insurance \u2014 including car, life, private medical and income cover. Despite this, there is still a significant difference between the prices paid by by male and female drivers on average, which is currently almost \u00a3100.\n\n\n\n", "description": "One in three motorists pays over the odds for their car insurance - and the worst thing you can do is simply renew.
