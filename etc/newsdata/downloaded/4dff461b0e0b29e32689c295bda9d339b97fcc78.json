Two previously scheduled preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets were played in China as planned.

It announced to halt the broadcasts of the China games last Tuesday in dissatisfaction, but has resumed the service\n\nThe news came as LeBron James, arguably one of the biggest voice in the league, said the Rockets general manager 'wasn't educated' on Hong Kong and should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nTwo live sessions were aired by Tencent early yesterday morning: one between the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls and the other between Israeli club Maccabi Haifa and the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nTencent had just signed a five-year deal, reported to be worth $1.5 billion (\u00a31.2 billion), with the basketball association for the rights to air live games online in July.\n\nIt charges viewers pay up to 60 yuan (\u00a36.7, $8.4) a month to watch NBA games.\n\nChina's state broadcaster CCTV, which owns the TV broadcasting right - had also halted its broadcasts of NBA preseason games in China. It remains unclear if it will air other preseason games.\n\nLeBron James, arguably one of the biggest voice in the NBA, said the general manager of Houston Rockets 'wasn't educated' on Hong Kong and should have kept his mouth shut\n\nAdam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, last week backed the NBA executive's tweet and promised to protect his employees' right to free speech - remarks that further angered Beijing\n\nSome viewers accused Tencent of surrendering to the NBA too soon.\n\nOn China's Twitter-like Weibo, one person slammed the website: 'CCTV has stopped the broadcasts, but Tencent is still showing\u2026 If we are not even willing to give up and ban basketball games, once [the same situation] escalates to the level of national security, it will be scary [to think]...'\n\nAnother user called for a boycott against Tencent: 'Keep your money and stop paying for the subscription.'\n\nA third commentator urged: 'Give one star to [Tencent's] app.'\n\nOther fans defended Tencent as they argued it would be acceptable to watch the NBA games apart from those featuring Houston Rockets.\n\nOne such supporter said: 'It's impossible not to watch the NBA. A ban on the NBA would equal to the act of forcing all Apple phone users to throw away their phones and start using Huawei. I like watching the NBA. Why can't I watch it?'\n\nAnother person seconded: 'The problem came from the Rockets, not the entire NBA. I think this is reasonable.'\n\nA third fan explained that Tencent had never announced to ban all of the NBA games: 'Tencent said in its statement that they would only halt the games in China.'\n\nChinese web users have raised questions after discovering Tencent is airing the NBA games again without making any announcement.

Pictured, a Chinese flag is seen placed on merchandise in the NBA flagship store in Beijing on October 9\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry declined to answer if Beijing had approved the broadcasts by Tencent.\n\nSpokesperson Gengshuang claimed that the Foreign Ministry 'normally does not make comments on commercial activities of certain companies'.\n\nBut he said: 'Sports exchange has always played a positive role in improving the China-US friendship and promoting the development of the two nations' bilateral relations.'\n\nHe added: 'No matter it is in China, the United States or other places in the world, an important prerequisite for exchanges and collaborations is mutual respect.'\n\nMailOnline has reached out to Tencent for comment over the matter.\n\nChinese workers are seen ripping down an NBA billboard advertisement last Wednesday after the nation's state broadcasters vowed not to air this week's preseason games in China\n\nAnti-NBA sentiment erupted in China last week after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey showed support for pro-democracy protests in the former British colony on Twitter, which is blocked in China.\n\nThe now-deleted post showed an image captioned 'Fight for Freedom; Stand with Hong Kong'.\n\nHis Tweet caused an instant outrage in China because the country views the pro-democracy unrest as a 'separatist movement' masterminded by 'Western forces'.\n\nIt also took place before the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets were scheduled to play two exhibition games in China.\n\nMorey deleted his tweet and apologised to 'Rockets fans and friends of mine in China'.\n\nIn a statement, the NBA called Morey's post 'regrettable.'\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey (pictured) tweeted as he apologised to Beijing\n\nMorey's initial tweet included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong'\n\nRockets guard James Harden almost immediately apologised to China even though he had not publicly expressed any views previously on the matter.\n\nBut Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, backed Morey's initial tweet and promised to protect his employees' right to free speech - remarks that further angered Beijing.\n\nAs a result, NBA preseason games were banned by broadcasters, Chinese companies pulled their sponsorship from the NBA and Rockets' merchandise was removed from shops nationwide.\n\nThe two Nets-Lakers games appeared to be in jeopardy in the aftermath of Morey's tweet, but they were played in Shanghai and Shenzhen as planned, although several media events, including player availability, were cancelled.\n\nJames Harden and Russell Westbrook apologise to Beijing through the press after their team's general manager Morey lent his support to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong\n\nLeBron James believed Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey 'was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation' when he tweeted in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers superstar broke his silence as the team returned home from a week-long tour of China which has been dominated by backlash at Morey's incendiary tweet.\n\n'Yes, we do have freedom of speech,' James said.\n\n'But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself. I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.'", "description": "Tencent - which owns the exclusive digital streaming rights for the NBA in China - last Tuesday announced to stop airing the league's  games to express its dissatisfaction towards the NBA.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19736436-0-image-a-30_1571137375813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
