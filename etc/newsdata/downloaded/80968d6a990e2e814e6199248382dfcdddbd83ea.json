According to People, in the background, a picture hangs on the wall above the fireplace of what appears to be the princess's bridal gown.\n\nAnother detail you may miss at first? The doorbell sounds to none other than God Save the Queen.\n\n\"Hi, mate, how are you doing?\" Ed asks when Harry opens the door.\n\n\"It's like looking in the mirror,\" the Duke of Sussex responds before welcoming him inside.\n\nThe 'doppelg\u00e4ngers' sit down at a table to discuss why Prince Harry invited Ed over.\n\n\"Thanks very much for coming. I really appreciate it,\" Harry says.\n\n\"Thanks for having me. This is something I'm quite passionate about,\" Ed responds.\n\n\"This, for me, is a subject and a conversation that's just not talked about enough. I think people all over the world are really suffering,\" Harry says.\n\nThe Beautiful People singer reveals he's so passionate about the cause he even tried writing a song about it, which Harry, of course, is happy to hear.\n\n\"People just don't understand what it's like for people like us,\" Ed says, and a confused Harry says, \"Wait, what?\"\n\nPrince Harry, of course, was talking about the importance of opening the discussion on mental health, but realised Ed wasn't when he said, \"With the jokes and the snide comments, I just feel like it's time that we stood up and said, you know, we're not going to take this anymore. We are ginger, and we're gonna fight.\"\n\nBefore the camera cut to a shot of Ed's laptop screen, Harry quickly clears things up.\n\n\"Slightly awkward... this is about World Mental Health Day.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, of course, of course,\" Ed says, deleting the title screen on his laptop that reads, \"GINGERS UNITE.\"\n\nWATCH THE FULL CLIP HERE:\n\nWhile Ed and Harry chose to make a more lighthearted video, His Royal Highness did urge everyone to look out for friends and family who may be suffering in silence.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" he says.", "description": "Prince Harry and Ed Sheeran join forces to talk about mental health in new video.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7776/96105c01d52146849f324eb28766dc94.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
