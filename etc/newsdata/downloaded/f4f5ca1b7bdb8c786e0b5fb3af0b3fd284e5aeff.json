Towelie forces Randy Marsh to shout 'F**k the Chinese Government' outraged that anyone could do business with the country despite its human rights atrocities.\n\nAt first Marsh is hesitant to repeat the declaration as he's selling marijuana in China - where weed is illegal - and grapples with the moral dilemma of raking in profits from a country with human rights concerns. But he eventually gives in and repeats 'F**k the Chinese Government' to appease Towelie.\n\nSouth Park continued to slam China in its 300th episode 'SHOTS!!!' that aired on Comedy Central on Wednesday where the character Randy Marsh declares 'F**k the Chinese Government'\n\nSouth Park shared a gif of that moment on Twitter with the hashtag #BannedInChina.\n\nThe jabs at China are a continuation of their episode last week called 'Band in China' that satirized the Chinese government, its censorship and authoritarian behavior and the complicity of American businesses for working with the nation.\n\nIn the episode South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker mocked China for censoring Winnie the Pooh as the children's cartoon character has become symbol of resistance against China's ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe episode also attacked the NBA, Disney and Marvel for doing business with the country.\n\nFollowing the 'Band in China' episode, China banned the show for its critique on its government and scrubbed all reference of the show from its internet.\n\nAnd in retaliation, protesters in Hong Kong have been playing bootlegged copies of the 'Band in China' episode on large projector screens in the streets, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe episode comes after China banned the show from its country this week for last week's episode 'Band in China' which heavily criticized the Communist government\n\nThe episode poked fun at American companies who bow to strict Chinese censorship laws and resulted in the Comedy Central show being scrubbed from the internet in China\n\nIn the plot from the episode last Wednesday, Randy (right) gets arrested carrying marijuana into China, frustrating his plans to sell weed\n\nHe is then sent to a work camp, where he sees Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who are imprisoned because the bear was used to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\nThe episode highlights the harsh conditions of the prison camp where Randy is held\n\nOn Monday Stone and Parker issued a mock apology to China saying: 'Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.'\n\n'Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?' the statement added.\n\nThe NBA name-drop was a reference to Houston rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's recent tweet supporting pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, which some Chinese NBA fans found offensive.\n\nMorey apologized on Monday for a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests, saying he did not intend to offend fans of the NBA team in China.\n\n'I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation on a complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives,' Morey said in a tweet.\n\nSouth Park's creators made mention of the NBA, which is trying to dig itself out of a controversy that was sparked by a tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey\n\nMorey apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nRockets star James Harden (above) on Monday apologized to China as the team and the NBA were forced into defensive mode when China's state broadcaster yanked Rockets games from the air and sponsors abandoned them\n\nTHE NBA'S STATEMENT ON MOREY'S TWEET 'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. 'While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. 'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.'\n\n'I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,' he said, adding that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or NBA.\n\nThe team's Chinese sponsor and a Chinese sportswear maker suspended work with the Rockets after Morey's tweet over the weekend.\n\nMorey quickly deleted the tweet, which included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.'\n\nIn recent months, masses of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong to protest a proposed bill that would allow for the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China.\n\nDemonstrators see the bill, which has since been withdrawn, as a worrying sign of China's attempts to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs.\n\nHong Kong is a semi-autonomous region that has special administrative status in China after the British handed back the territory in 1997.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said it recognized Morey's views have 'deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.'", "description": "South Park has hit back at China in its 300th episode saying 'F**k the Chinese Government' after the nation scrubbed the show from its internet when the animated series mocked Beijing's censorship.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/19550742-0-image-a-28_1570731206672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
