His hatred of the Jewish people and Israel is not transactional but ideological. He has accused Israelis of being Nazis and has repeatedly and falsely accused Israel of genocide. He has also destroyed Turkey\u2019s democracy. He must be stopped from destroying the Kurds.\n\nTurkey\u2019s aggression also harms Israel by hurting one of its allies \u2013 the Kurds \u2013 and giving new confidence to the Iranians that the United States will not take military action to prevent their hegemonic activities and consolidation of forces inside Syria. It was Obama\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from Iraq that first emboldened the Iranians. That mistake should not be repeated by a president who has proven himself to be Israel\u2019s staunchest ally.\n\nWhile the American withdrawal of troops has been the focus of critics, let us not ignore the continued complicity of the Europeans who have stood on the sidelines throughout the mass slaughter in Syria. They are doing nothing now to prevent Turkey from conducting its own campaign of ethnic cleansing.\n\nPerhaps the only silver lining is the betrayal of the Kurds is a validation of Zionism.", "description": "", "authors": ["Shmuley Boteach", "Jpost.Com Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
