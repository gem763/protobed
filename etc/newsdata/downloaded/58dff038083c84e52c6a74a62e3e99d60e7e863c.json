Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, would have left the president off of the ballot in California\u2019s March 2020 primary unless he submitted five years\u2019 worth of his tax returns by a Nov. 26 deadline, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nTRUMP FILES LAWSUIT IN BID TO PROTECT PERSONAL, CORPORATE TAX RETURNS FROM RELEASE\n\nTrump's lawyers said SB 27 would unfairly force the president to give up his right to privacy. Dhillon said that no presidential candidate will be required to release their taxes as a condition of being on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIf it is unconstitutional in California, it is unconstitutional everywhere, and I hope that this will deter other states from foolishly going down this path,\u201d she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUnder SB 27, Trump would be included on the general election ballot in November 2020. Opponents of the law argue depressed GOP voter turnout in the primary could discourage voters from showing up to vote for the president in the main race.\n\nUnder California\u2019s so-called jungle primary system, all candidates, regardless of party, vie for the same elected office and the top two vote-getters move on to the general election. Since it was implemented in California in 2010, this system has often ensured a Democrat-on-Democrat general election battle in all but \"The Golden State's\" most conservative areas. Depressed GOP turnout in primaries could mean even fewer Republicans move on to general elections.\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.", "description": "Attorney Harmeet Dhillon\u2019s fight to get President Trump back on the ballot in California turned out as \u201ca victory for voters and the First Amendment,\u201d she told,\u00a0\u201cFox & Friends First.\u201d", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-10.23.16-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
