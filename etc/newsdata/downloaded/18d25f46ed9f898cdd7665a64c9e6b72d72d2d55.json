Current central bank leaders largely continue to reject such ideas, even in the face of growing evidence their policies aren't working.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell declared that the U.S. central bank is undergoing a wide-ranging examination of its policy toolkit, but also said this week that the only unorthodox plan the Fed is really considering is yield curve control. This was implemented in Japan in 2016 and has yet to deliver meaningful growth or inflation for the country.\n\nThe big picture: \"The Fed needs new ideas,\" Christina Romer, a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, told Axios at this week's National Association of Business Economists conference in Denver.\n\nFor Romer, now an economics professor at UC Berkeley, the rethink is required because the previous rules governing how central banks operate have been upended by rock bottom inflation and interest rates. That will make traditional monetary policy less effective.\n\n\"To their credit, [the Fed] did a rethinking of their framework, but didn\u2019t really conclude that they needed to rethink all that much. I think they need to rethink a little more radically,\" she added.\n\nA deeper look at some radical ideas from the mainstream\n\nData: FRED; Chart: Axios Visuals\n\nFederal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm has proposed automatic government payments directly to individuals when the 3-month average unemployment rate rises 0.50 percentage points above the low from the previous year.\n\nShe picked that metric because every time it has happened since the 1970s the economy has gone into contraction. The indicator currently shows a reading of 0%, suggesting the economy looks stable.\n\nRomer told Axios she supports similar plans that include so-called automatic stabilizers, or government spending, that activates based on data rather than legislators needing to authorize new spending.\n\n\"Building more of that into the system would be healthy,\" she said.\n\nCatherine Mann, a former chief economist at the OECD and current global chief economist at Citi Research, has proposed a program that would use central bank funds to deposit shopping vouchers directly into consumers' accounts.\n\nShe says many new proposals ignore the realities of declining aggregate demand, income distribution and lower productivity.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re having the wrong discussion,\" she told Axios at the NABE conference.\n\nJulia Coronado, a former Federal Reserve economist and current president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said she's working on a paper that will advocate combining helicopter money with a central bank digital currency.", "description": "A few years ago, some of the ideas would have been considered laughable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dAHft9hvWkouSVib6B_GfuNcVyU=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/11/1570794147115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
