Developers use them to write code, and that\u2019s about it. But yesterday, the makers of the popular open-source text editor Notepad++ released an update with the codename: \u201cFree Uighur.\u201d This fateful decision has incensed many Chinese netizens, consequently turning a bland utilitarian tool into another fracture in the already-fraught relationship between the West and the world\u2019s newest superpower.\n\nAt the heart of most open source software projects is GitHub, and it\u2019s quite fitting that the front-line of this digital culture war is here. Already, the GitHub issues page (where developers and users highlight newly-discovered bugs within a program) has been brigaded by hundreds of angry posts, making it difficult for the developers to respond to genuine issues with the software.\n\n\u201cForeigners usually treat China with double standards,\u201d opined GitHub user HuChundong. Another post, from user cszongyang, had the title \u201cDebunking Western Propaganda.\u201d Their post contained a point-by-point refutation (for lack of a better word) of the established wisdom surrounding the lot of China\u2019s Uighur ethnic minority, which centered on accusing Western media sources like CNN of Sinophobic prejudice.\n\nUighurs are a predominantly-Muslim ethnic group based in the North West of China, mostly centered in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Province.\n\nHuman rights organization Amnesty International has accused the Chinese government of interning over a million Uighurs in what have been dubbed \u201cre-education camps.\u201d Outside of the detention camps, Xinjiang\u2019s citizens live under a system of high-tech surveillance, and are routinely fingerprinted and searched by local authorities as they go about their ordinary business.\n\nThe issues tracker also contains submissions combatting the pro-China trolls. One post, titled \u201cMessage to Winnie the Pooh of China (aka Xi Jinping),\u201d contains a somewhat trolling message that combines references to the notorious Tiananmen Square Massacre with juvenile playground insults.\n\nChinese authorities banned the 2018 film adaptation of the beloved AA Milne children\u2019s book after social media posts compared China\u2019s increasingly authoritarian president to the protagonist.\n\nThese two opposing forces have inadvertently combined to utterly derail any legitimate discussion about Notepad++. It\u2019s also unclear if the project will face any further repercussions from Chinese authorities, such as a nation-wide ban. Fortunately, as a non-commercial project, the developers are relatively immune from any financial pressure that might entail as a result of the controversy.\n\nThis episode is the latest in a series of conflicts between Western figures and China. Earlier this year, the NBA faced boycotts after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protestors.\n\nAnd in October, gaming giant Blizzard banned pro-Hearthstone player Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung after he proclaimed \u201cliberate Hong Kong\u201d during a Chinese-language interview. After a public outcry in the West, Blizzard backed down, diluting Blitzchung\u2019s one-year ban into a six-month suspension.", "description": "First the NBA.
