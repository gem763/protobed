The activists also sprayed the slogan \"Stop funding climate death\" on the walls of the building.", "description": "Climate change activists spraying red paint at the facade of British finance ministry from fire engine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/56/44/1000x563_cmsv2_b7134881-59e5-52af-b62f-d47e1d424bd3-4205644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
