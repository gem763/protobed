Burroughs ruled, despite ample evidence, that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian-Americans during its admissions process.\n\n\u201cAs an Asian-American student at Harvard, I\u2019m extremely grateful that I got in despite my background. But I am especially fearful for Asian applicants to Harvard in the future,\u201d Babphavong said. \u201cI don\u2019t like that the judge upheld the use of race in this decision. I think it\u2019s extremely telling that she had to recommend implicit bias training to Harvard\u2019s admissions officers.\u201d\n\nBabphavong went after Harvard\u2019s lack of emphasis on intellectual diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s not actual diversity. Actual diversity would be economic or ideological slant. But this is only a visual diversity. It\u2019s faux diversity,\u201d Babphavong said during the appearance.\n\n\u201cWe should be looking at people\u2019s hard work, their grit, their individualism. We shouldn\u2019t be looping them into different racial groups and assuming homogeneity,\u201d she added.\n\nDespite her light criticisms, Judge Burroughs heaped praise on Harvard in her 130-page decision. In one portion of the decision, Judge Burroughs described the Harvard admissions office as a \u201cvery fine admissions program,\u201d going only further to suggest that it only slightly falls short of \u201cperfection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is always the specter of perfection, but strict scrutiny does not require it and a few identified imperfections, after years of litigating and sifting through applications and metrics, do not alone require a finding that Harvard\u2019s admissions program is not narrowly tailored.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on the admissions discrimination case against Harvard University.", "description": "Harvard student Kelley Babphavong condemned her university's discriminatory admissions procedure in an appearance on\u00a0Fox & Friends\u00a0this week.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/AsianAmerican_students_Harvard_turned_down-Getty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
