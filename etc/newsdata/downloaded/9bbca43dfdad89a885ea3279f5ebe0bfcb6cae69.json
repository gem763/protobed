According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 out of every 3 people are sleep deprived on a regular basis. That\u2019s important since consistently not getting the sleep your body needs is associated with several health problems, including a higher risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke.\n\nBut is getting too much sleep also bad for your health? Possibly.\n\nA new study on more than 5,200 people between 45 and 75 years old, which was published in The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, found a link between sleeping for long periods of time (along with chronic insomnia symptoms) and declines in memory, executive function and processing speed \u2014 all signs that can come before people develop mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, according to a statement by the study\u2019s lead author, Alberto R. Ramos, MD, an associate professor of neurology specializing in sleep medicine at the University of Miami Miller School.\n\nHispanic subjects were chosen for the study because, according to Ramos, they \u201chave a significantly higher risk of Alzheimer's disease compared with non-Hispanic whites.\"\n\nSleeping too much is associated with several other health issues, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nBut, like the famous chicken-or-the-egg conundrum, which comes first \u2014 sleeping too much or the health problem?\n\n\u201cThe study is associating Alzheimer\u2019s with oversleeping, which does not mean one is causing the other,\u201d Aneesa Das, MD, sleep medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (who is not associated with the study), tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAssociation does not mean causation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that chronic health conditions can lead to oversleeping than the other way around, says Das. Rafael Pelayo, MD, a sleep specialist at the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, agrees, telling Yahoo Lifestyle: \u201cIf someone is sleeping more than before, especially if they\u2019re often tired, you have to wonder about some underlying medical problems.\u201d\n\nDas notes that excessive sleepiness is often due to a mood disorder, such as depression. \u201cIf you\u2019re sleeping all day, you have to look at your mental health,\u201d she says. \u201cThat would be my first concern for people. Number two, people could be oversleeping because of endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism.\u201d\n\nAlong with certain medications (including over-the-counter ones) that can cause sleepiness, Das notes that obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a common condition where breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted while sleeping \u2014 decreases sleep quality, making people more tired, which can lead to oversleeping.\n\nThere are also sleep disorders, such as idiopathic hypersomnia (a rare disorder that makes people excessively sleepy) and narcolepsy (which causes \u201coverwhelming\u201d daytime drowsiness and sudden \u201cattacks of sleep,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic) \u2014 both of which can cause a person to sleep more than usual.\n\nSo what\u2019s the right amount of sleep you should be aiming for?\n\nFor \u201coptimal health and wellbeing,\u201d the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society recommend that adults ages 18-60 get at least seven hours each night. Most experts, including Das, say a healthy range is between seven to nine hours per night (although she points out that there are outliers, such as long sleepers who need 10 or more hours per night, as well as short sleepers who are fine on six hours a night).\n\nBut Pelayo points out that it\u2019s not just about logging a certain amount of sleep between the sheets \u2014 quality is also key. \u201cIt\u2019s whether you feel refreshed or not,\u201d he says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be waking up tired.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "When it comes to sleep, many people are not getting enough, but as it turns out, getting too much can be a sign of an underlying health issue.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Sx7yciTEFNsWu42.qJsl6w--~B/aD0yODMyO3c9NDI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/32b7f750-eba1-11e9-8bef-377b2e77ddb7", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
