If it means free trade and peaceful interaction with other nations, the answer is yes.\n\nBut if it means global governance by anti-market bureaucracies such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nSo I have mixed feelings about this video from Dalibor Rohac of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nI can\u2019t resist nit-picking on some of his points.\n\nBrexit was unquestionably a vote about the merits of membership in the European Union. The 2016 presidential election was about a lot of issues (trade, immigration, Hillary Clinton, etc). The United Nations was an asterisk at most.\n\nA nation can import flags (or anything else) while retaining sovereignty. A nation can also make a sovereign choice to abide by a certain set of trade rules, such as the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn reference to the Hanseatic League and the Holy Roman Empire, trade pacts and military alliances also can be seen as expressions of sovereignty.\n\nWhile I have disagreements with Dalibor, that definitely doesn\u2019t put me in the same camp as Donald Trump.\n\nThe President is an incoherent mix. He combines odious protectionism with mostly-empty rhetoric about globalism. And he does all that without understanding issues \u2013 and, in some cases, his actions are contrary to his rhetoric.\n\nDan Henninger wrote about these issues two days ago for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe wisely warns that failures by national governments (most notably unaffordable welfare states and incompetent administrative states) are creating openings for unpalatable alternatives.\n\nGlobal governance is one distressing possibility. Henninger worries about Chinese-style administrative authoritarianism.\n\nPresident Trump at the United Nations this week elaborated on his long-running antagonism toward globalism. \u2026There is merit to these concerns, but I think the critics of \u201cglobalism,\u201d including most prominently Mr. Trump, underestimate the near-term danger of the serious difficulties appearing today in national democratic governance. Democracies maintain their legitimacy in the public\u2019s eye only if they demonstrate a reasonable capacity to address society\u2019s inevitably complex challenges. \u2026it\u2019s clear that many of the 21st century\u2019s independent nations are having a remarkably difficult time executing their sovereign responsibilities. \u2026Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about undemocratic governance by remote international bureaucracies are plausible, but the greater threat is more imminent. If the expansion of an increasingly dysfunctional administrative state inside the world\u2019s sovereign democracies is inexorable and unreformable, the future will belong to China\u2019s brand of administrative authoritarianism. \u2026Elizabeth Warren and her multiple plans\u2014heavily dependent on criminal prosecutions and intense oversight\u2014is flirting with a milder version of this future.\n\nHenninger is certainly correct that nations mostly get in trouble because of their own mistakes.\n\nFor instance, I\u2019ve pointed out that the fiscal crisis in Europe should not be blamed on the euro.\n\nThat being said, global governance often creates moral hazard, which tends to exacerbate and encourage bad policy by national governments.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at an interesting column that John Bolton (Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor) wrote on global governance for the U.K.-based Times back in 2016. Here are some of the key passages.\n\nHe makes the should-be-obvious point that not all international bureaucracies are alike.\n\n\u2026international organisations sometimes act as if they are governments rather than associations of governments and sprout bureaucracies with pretensions beyond those of cosseted elites in national capitals. \u2026International bodies take many different forms, and it serves no analytical purpose to treat them interchangeably. Nato, for example, is not equivalent to the United Nations. Neither is equivalent to the European Union. Each has different objectives, and different implications for constitutional and democratic sovereignty. \u2026Nato is America\u2019s kind of international partnership: a classic politico-military alliance of nation states. It has never purported to assume sovereign functions, and is as distant as is imaginable from the EU paradigm.\n\nHe explains that some of them \u2013 most notably the IMF \u2013 are counterproductive and should be shut down.\n\nProposals to reform the UN and its affiliated bodies such as the World Bank and the IMF are almost endless. The real question is whether serious, sweeping reform of these organisations\u2026is ever possible. \u2026In 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, the former secretaries of the Treasury William Simon and George Shultz, and Walter Wriston, a former chairman of Citibank, wrote in The Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe IMF is ineffective, unnecessary, and obsolete. We do not need another IMF, as Mr. [George] Soros recommends. Once the Asian crisis is over, we should abolish the one we have.\u201d \u2026We should consider privatising all the development banks\u2026 We should ask why US taxpayers are compelled to provide subsidised interest rates for loans by international development banks.\n\nAmen.\n\nHe also opines about Brexit.\n\n\u2026the Brexit referendum was, above all else, a reassertion of British sovereignty, a declaration of independence from would-be rulers who, while geographically close, were remote from the peasantry they sought to rule. \u2026The Brexit decision was deplored by British and American elites alike\u2026 It does not surprise Americans that British elites have not reconciled themselves to losing\u2026 London and Washington can fashion a new economic relationship, perhaps involving Canada, with the potential for significant economic growth. Let the EU wallow in strangling economic regulation, and the euro albatross that Britain wisely never joined.\n\nHe\u2019s right, especially the final sentence of that excerpt.\n\nI\u2019ll conclude by reiterating my observation that we should distinguish between good globalization and bad globalization.\n\nThe good kind involves trade, peaceful interaction, and jurisdictional competition, all of which are consistent with sovereignty.\n\nThe bad kind of globalism involves international bureaucracies acting as supranational governments \u2013 almost always (as Nobel laureate Edward Prescott observed) with the goal of enabling and facilitating a larger burden of government.", "description": "I\u2019m a big fan of globalization, so does that make .10/01/2019 11:22:51AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
