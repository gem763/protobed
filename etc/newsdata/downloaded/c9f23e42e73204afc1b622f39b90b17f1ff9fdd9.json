REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nBRUSSELS/ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have cleared E.ON\u2019s (EONGn.DE) proposed purchase of rival Innogy\u2019s (IGY.DE) network and retail assets, paving the way for a major reshuffle in Germany\u2019s energy sector.\n\nThe approval seals the fate of Innogy, which was carved out from RWE (RWEG.DE) and listed three years ago as a separate entity, with its assets being taken over by its parent and peer E.ON.\n\nThe European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 28-member European Union, said on Tuesday that approval was granted as long as E.ON would sell certain businesses in Germany, the Czech Republic and Hungary.\n\nIt had identified the threat of reduced competition in sectors of the three countries. E.ON said the assets it must sell include about 2 million supply customers, most of them in eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cIt is important that all Europeans and businesses can buy electricity and gas at competitive prices,\u201d EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement, adding that E.ON\u2019s commitments meant the merger would not lead to less choice and higher prices.\n\nE.ON has agreed to drop most of its customers supplied with heating electricity in Germany and to discontinue the operation of 34 electric charging stations along German autobahn highways.\n\nIt will also divest part of its retail business in Hungary as well as Innogy\u2019s retail power and gas business in the Czech Republic. It said the asset sales in total would negatively impact results by more than 100 million euros.\n\n\u201cConsidering ... E.ON\u2019s outstanding development opportunities, these quite painful concessions are tolerable,\u201d Chief Executive Johannes Teyssen said.\n\nThe deal to break up Innogy marks the biggest overhaul of the German power industry since the country sped up its exit from nuclear energy. It will turn E.ON into a networks and retail energy group and RWE into Europe\u2019s No.3 renewables player.", "description": "EU antitrust regulators have cleared E.ON's proposed purchase of rival Innogy's network and retail assets, paving the way for a major reshuffle in Germany's energy sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430819737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0V2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
