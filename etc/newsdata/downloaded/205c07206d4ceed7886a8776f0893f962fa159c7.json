EM ASIA FX-Most Asian currencies slip ahead of trade talks; Taiwan dollar gains\n\n* Media report on US-China talks press offshore yuan\n\n* Top-level talks open in Washington on Thursday\n\n* Taiwan dollar rises ahead of September trade data (Adds text, updates prices)\n\nBy Shreya Mariam Job\n\nOct 7 (Reuters) - Most Asian currencies edged lower on Monday after risk appetites were dented by a media report saying China wants the scope of this week's trade talks and any deal with the United States to be kept narrow.\n\nMarket sentiment was dampened by a Bloomberg report stating Chinese officials are signalling increasing reluctance to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump. trade talks between the United States and China are scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Risk of breakdown in trade talks will re-ignite fears and pose further upward pressure on USD-AXJs (Asia ex Japan),\" a Maybank note said.\n\nThe report pulled the offshore yuan the currency most exposed to trade tensions, 0.3% lower against the dollar. Onshore trading in the yuan was closed due to a holiday in China.\n\nAmong Southeast Asian currencies, the Philippine peso declined the most, weakening 0.3%.\n\nThe Singapore dollar slipped 0.1% on weakness in the offshore yuan, while the Malaysian ringgit skidded 0.1%.\n\nThe Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID dropped 0.2%. Data showed that the country's foreign reserves dropped by $2.1 billion to $124.3 billion in September, partly due to payments of offshore public debt. DOLLAR\n\nBucking Monday's trend, the Taiwan dollar TWD=TP firmed as much as 0.3% ahead of release of the island's September trade data due at 0800 GMT Monday.\n\n\"We think TWD is likely to be more resilient compared to KRW and CNH, as it benefits from trade diversion and potential capital repatriation flows,\" a Barclays (LON: ) note said.\n\nMany companies have been moving their manufacturing facilities to the island amid rising tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the United States.\n\nTaiwan's exports are likely to have grown 1% in September from a year earlier, logging a second month of growth, according to a Reuters poll.
