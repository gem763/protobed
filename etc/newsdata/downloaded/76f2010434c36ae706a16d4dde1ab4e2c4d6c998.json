Declining usage of traditional TV across every demographic, particularly among young viewers, has also demanded new solutions to the traditional distribution model that is pay-TV.\n\nAlthough streaming media bundles are still evolving, four distinct models have emerged:\n\nSkinny bundles \u2014 Cheaper, streaming versions of the traditional pay-TV bundle, but with fewer channels.\n\nSVOD aggregators \u2014 Facilitate a la carte sign-ups to third-party streaming services through a central user portal. The primary example so far is Amazon Channels, Amazon's SVOD partner program.\n\nSVOD integrations \u2014 SVOD services like Netflix that bring their offerings to a traditional operator's service.\n\nStreaming service partnerships \u2014 Combine one or more streaming services under a single offering, at a lower cost than the total price separately.\n\nIn the SVOD Bundling Report, Business Insider Intelligence examines the state of the US video ecosystem and how media companies are refining their distribution strategies to meet the changing needs of consumers. The report situates each of the four bundle model types within the overall SVOD market, and investigates the overarching advantages and challenges each faces. Finally, we predict how player dynamics might transform and adapt, outlining best practices for providers to succeed within the new TV landscape.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nSVOD bundles partake in a growing SVOD market in the US. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that the SVOD market totals $13.6 billion in 2018, primarily driven by uptake on services from SVOD giants Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nStreaming video accessed on over-the-top (OTT) platforms is going mainstream, while consumers \u2014 particularly younger viewers \u2014 are reducing usage on live, linear TV. Traditional TV usage among viewers ages 18-24 has dropped 48% since 2011, 35% among 25-34 year olds, and 18% in the 35-49 demographic.\n\nSkinny bundle services are growing in popularity, with 7.2 million subscribers in the US, but they suffer fundamental financial sustainability problems.\n\nDistributors with at-scale platforms and powerful back-end tech can capitalize on the growing consumer demand for content consolidation among consumers. Faced with a fragmented and expanding universe of content options, more than two-thirds of consumers say they would prefer to get all their services from a single source, per Hub Entertainment Research.\n\nWinners in the bundling shakeout will have prioritized internet-connected tech, an effective user experience, reasonable pricing, and content diversity.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nIdentifies the four SVOD model types that have emerged as alternatives or supplements to traditional distribution.\n\nInvestigates the top advantages and challenges of each model type.\n\nOutlines strategies that players across media and distribution companies can use to address business or market challenges.\n\nExplores how the dynamics of each model type will evolve as services converge under new bundled offerings.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
