Dressed in formal business attire with official-looking name tags, the 19 small teams attempt to blend in with the well-heeled clientele as they race around the hotel for three hours, checking absurd tasks off their lists. Take a picture hugging a guest while wearing his or her bathrobe? Check. Gather the \u201ccompany\u201d into a maid\u2019s closet? Check. One participant strips down to take a bubble bath in a momentarily empty room. Others deliver room service.\n\nWhen security catches on (\u201cThere\u2019s one group booked here and this isn\u2019t them,\u201d a guard is overheard telling his colleague.) and begins cutting off elevator access to certain floors, attendees slip into back stairwells and, later, freight elevators.\n\nSome planned pop-up activities, like ballroom dancing lessons, have to be scrapped. But the finale to the illicit event goes on as planned: the 80 people who stick it out make their way onto the roof of the hotel for a secret show replete with a burlesque-dancing opera singer, an accordionist, and an upright bassist. Below, midtown New York City literally sparkles.", "description": "The Wanderlust Projects duo are building bars in water towers and romantic getaways in abandoned resorts.
