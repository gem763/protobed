Jeff Flake called on Republicans to not support President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and argued that his latest scandal involving Ukraine warrants impeachment.\n\n\u201cWhether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection,\u201d Flake, a vocal critic of Trump, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe former senator\u2019s op-ed comes as House Democrats are barreling ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry after it was revealed that Trump pressured Ukraine's president during a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nFlake expressed his concerns over impeachment, saying he fears it may stir up further division in the country, but believes that an investigation into the Ukraine conflict \u201cought to go forward,\" he noted in a recent interview with NPR.\n\nOn Monday, he argued in the op-ed that despite his reservations, \"With what we now know, the president\u2019s actions warrant impeachment.\"\n\nFlake represented Arizona since 2013 but did not seek reelection last year, claiming he refused to continue backing Trump, a move he is pushing his Republican colleagues to make.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job. But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.\u201d", "description": "Flake wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post on Monday.", "authors": ["Oma Seddiq"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/d7/096482ea4e539c8ba039d7bdb757/180927-jeff-flake-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
