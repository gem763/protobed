On another level, it\u2019s pretty sad that it\u2019s not so shocking.\u201d\n\nTitle IX is a wonderful thing, opening up doors for hundreds of thousands of women to compete on a supposedly level playing field with men.\n\nOf course, its noble purpose hasn\u2019t come close to being fully realized.\n\nThat was apparent last weekend in Ohio.\n\nIt all began with Maine\u2019s nationally ranked field hockey team traveling to Kent State to play a round-robin set of games involving the host school and another out-of-town team, Temple.\n\nDuring a Saturday morning match, the Black Bears went to overtime in a scoreless tie with Temple. Suddenly, Kent State officials called a halt to the game, saying the field hockey pitch was needed to shoot off fireworks before a noon football game between the Golden Flashes and Kennesaw State at adjacent Dix Stadium.\n\nFireworks?\n\nIn broad daylight?\n\n\u201cWe were confused at first,\u201d Field recalled. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\nMaine and Temple were told they could come back at 5:30 p.m. - seven hours later - to finish their match, but that would\u2019ve turned an outrageous situation into a downright farce.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Temple coach Susan Ciufo said, barely containing the disdain in her voice, \u201cwas an interesting suggestion.\u201d\n\nThe Owls couldn\u2019t stay, anyway, because they had already scheduled a 400-mile bus ride back to Philadelphia.\n\nEven if they could, neither team had any intention of carrying on the match under those ludicrous circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe whole part of having overtime is that the outcome of the game is determined in overtime,\u201d Maine coach Josette Babineau said. \u201cBoth teams are at the worn-out stage and they\u2019re testing each other physically to get the outcome of the game. To come back (seven hours later) and play each other for 10 minutes would change the outcome of the game. Both teams would be fresh.\u201d\n\nSo, after two teams gave their hearts and souls to win a match that meant the world to them, it went down in the books as nothing more than an exhibition, a scrimmage, a non-game.\n\nNo winner.\n\nNo loser.\n\nNothing to remember it by on either team\u2019s record or stats.\n\nSadly, that\u2019s an appropriate metaphor for the way many people view women\u2019s athletics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive and it\u2019s upsetting to think that just because of your gender, your sport is looked at as less,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe work just as hard as any men\u2019s team. I really do believe that.\u201d\n\nThe Kent State debacle has given her reason to reflect even more on the way things should be.\n\n\u201cWe get an opportunity when we\u2019re recruited to be on a team at a higher level,\u201d Field said. \u201cThen, once we commit to show up, when I came here as a UMaine Black Bear that first day, that gives me the right to a locker room, the right to the training room, the right to the weight room and to practice time. Ultimately, to finish a game is 110 percent a right.\u201d\n\nReached Friday on her cellphone shortly before Temple hosted Bryant in its first game since the non-game, Ciufo said the fiasco at Kent State obscured some of the daily indignities endured by female athletes.\n\n\u201cEverybody tries to say we\u2019re treated equally because the uniforms are the same, the equipment is the same,\u201d the Temple coach said. \u201cBut it could be something as simple as being treated with respect, like choosing the practice times you want. A lot of small pieces go into the inequities. It\u2019s not always something major. Last weekend was something major, so it\u2019s getting a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nWhile the two teams received plenty of support from the Twitter-verse, there are still a fair share of Neanderthals out there who believe women should stick to the kitchen instead of trying to get in the game.\n\n\u201cTitle IX is great,\u201d Field said. \u201cBut the fact that Title IX has to exist for us to receive the right to be equals is pretty self-explanatory.\u201d\n\nOf course, the NCAA can always be counted on to make a bad situation worse. Temple requested that the game at least be counted as a tie, which would be a boost to the rebuilding program\u2019s resume and RPI ranking. But the NCAA ruled there are no ties in field hockey, so the game can\u2019t go into the record books. Temple plans to appeal, but we all know how that\u2019s going to end.\n\nKent State officials have rightly been taken to the woodshed over their boneheaded decision, which looked even more outrageous when Field posted video that showed barely visible fireworks being shot off in the middle of the day for a stadium that appeared to be mostly empty shortly before kickoff.\n\nUniversity President Todd Diacon sent out a statement Thursday essentially falling on his sword.\n\n\u201cIt was a regrettable decision, and I am truly sorry about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll week, I have been thinking of the visiting student-athletes who spent countless hours practicing and preparing for a tournament on our campus, and of the parents who traveled here to show their support. We can, and must, do better.\u201d\n\nHe said the Office of Compliance, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action would be launching an investigation.\n\nBut that\u2019s mere window-dressing at this point, a way to make those in charge feel better about the horrific message they already sent to all female athletes.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to make it right for the players at Maine and Temple.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a fix at this point,\u201d Field said. \u201cTo come out on the field and play Temple again would just leave a sour taste in my mouth, to be honest. It would almost be more embarrassing. It should have been finished the first time.\u201d\n\nHopefully, a lesson was learned.\n\nHopefully, a few more hearts and minds are changed.\n\nBut let\u2019s never lose sight of this reality.\n\nAs we approach five decades since the passage of Title IX, female athletes are not being treated as equals.\n\nThey\u2019re not even considered the equal of a fireworks display in broad daylight.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.
