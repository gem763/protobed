No one can touch him", "language": "en", "text": "Years ago, Boris Johnson described his strategy in interviews as to become \u201ca blond wall of noise\u201d through which his interviewer cannot penetrate.\n\nIt has self-evidently served him well, but arguably his new ruse is faring even better. He is no longer a wall of noise but a wall of s**t. He is cocooned in his own inadequacy.\n\nThis, clearly, was the plan all along: to be so relentlessly terrible, to have so many career-ending scandals running concurrently that it is impossible for any interviewer to know where to start or stop.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

According to a story in the morning papers, Johnson was accused of having lunch with two female journalists and was alleged to have touched not one but both of them under the table.\n\nTwo years ago, this exact behaviour led to the resignation of two of Theresa May\u2019s most senior ministers. But with Johnson, there simply isn\u2019t time to mention it when the interviewer has only got so long \u2013 to pick just a few: the Supreme Court making him apologise to the Queen; MPs accusing him of complicity in threats of violence against them; and delivering a Brexit that won\u2019t ruin millions of people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. There\u2019s also that rather awkward story about the woman who\u2019s received more than \u00a3100,000 worth of public money in \u201ctech\u201d grants, and whose flat he used to go and visit in the middle of the afternoon for what she has called \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s also appropriating the murder of a Remain campaigning MP for the cause of Brexit, as Johnson did at the despatch box of the House of Commons on Wednesday, hours after the Supreme Court forced him to reopen it.\n\nEach, any and absolutely all of these are very much the sort of thing prime ministers traditionally resign for. But so huge is the stockpile of humiliation, it almost becomes smaller.\n\nJust as people with overwhelming amounts of work to do tend to find themselves paralysed and unable to do anything, so Johnson is so useless and so shameless he is almost in the clear.\n\nFor his part, it\u2019s hard to imagine Johnson himself was not entirely delighted to spent a full 20 minutes of live prime-time political television on whether or not it\u2019s OK to call what has come to be known as the Benn Act, the \u201cSurrender Act\u201d.\n\nQuite possibly the only interesting thing David Cameron said in the recent public conversation devoted to the publication of his memoirs was on the central and seemingly unsolvable problem of what he calls the \u201cpost-truth\u201d age. With regard to the still-not-quite-finished row about the Vote Leave \u00a3350m bus, Cameron told The Times this: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is a real problem in politics \u2013 and there is no real answer to this. If you\u2019re having a row about your issue, you\u2019re winning, even if the numbers are wrong.\u201d\n\nAll Johnson wants to do is make the term \u201cSurrender Act\u201d stick in the public consciousness, and all Labour wants to do is tell him he\u2019s not allowed to. And so all Andrew Marr wanted to do was argue about whether or not the term \u201cSurrender Act\u201d is morally acceptable. It meant that the term, the one Labour wants effectively banned from public debate, was mentioned, by my count, 19 separate times in just under 15 minutes. And here I am, mentioning it too.\n\nThere is precious little time to note that, at the precise moment the prime minister was speaking about the \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d he is building, the number was reduced to six. The BBC News website, which had reported the number as being 40, genuinely put out a statement in which it essentially apologised for having taken at face value the prime minister\u2019s own promise.\n\nIt has now corrected its story. When Marr told Johnson, \u201cIt\u2019s not 40 new hospitals is it, it\u2019s six\u201d, Johnson at least had the good grace not to try to correct him.\n\nWithout wishing to get too deep in the technicalities of the Jennifer Arcuri story, it is a fact that when money was awarded to Arcuri while Johnson was mayor, Johnson should have declared an interest at the time that the two were, as Marr put it, \u201cfriends\u201d.\n\nDid you declare an interest? He was asked three times. Eventually he said the words: \u201cThere was no interest to declare.\u201d\n\nThat is, straightforwardly, not true. And it will become a fact in the days ahead.\n\nIt is the sort of thing ministers resign for. But one suspects this one will get away with it.\n\nVoters tend to be quite forgiving of all manner of transgressions. The only thing you can\u2019t get away with is hypocrisy. And this is the reality of the new politics, here, in America and all around the world.\n\nJohnson has set the bar of expectation so low he cannot fail to stumble over it. It\u2019s a stunning game plan. Nobody expects anything of him, beyond a non-stop cavalcade of lies and uselessness.\n\nWe all expect to be disappointed. Perhaps we even demand it. And goodness knows, he is not going to disappoint us.", "description": "Years ago, Boris Johnson described his strategy in interviews as to become \u201ca blond wall of noise\u201d through which his interviewer cannot penetrate.
