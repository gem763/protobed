If a supplier has 10,000 customers in credit by just \u00a320, that's a \u00a3200,000 interest-free loan to buy energy, cover business operations or invest in further growth.'\n\nBut the sneaky loan grab is not the only reason customers should demand a refund of any credit sitting in their energy account. A dozen providers have gone bust in the past year. Toto Energy, which had 134,000 customers, last week became the latest casualty and further failures are expected this winter.\n\nIt is estimated that suppliers are holding on to more than \u00a31.5billion of customers' cash.\n\nIf a supplier fails, credit balances are ring-fenced under rules set by regulator Ofgem. A new supplier is chosen to take responsibility for abandoned customer accounts.\n\nBut there have still been problems. Customers of Extra Energy, for example, which went into administration in November last year, waited months for a refund. A final bill is needed before overpayments are returned, but the last wave of final bills only hit doormats or email inboxes last month.\n\nOne customer commenting online this month says: 'Like a lot of other customers I want my credit balance with Extra Energy returned to me. It is my money and I want it back.'\n\nOverpayments have swelled in the past decade as automatic direct debits are now the payment method for 70 per cent of households, compared to 20 per cent in 2007 \u2013 when a lot of people would have paid on receipt of a bill.\n\nPaying via direct debit is usually a condition for signing up to cheaper tariffs. It also suits many households \u2013 until a provider goes bust. As a result of recent company failures, Ofgem has announced new rules to ensure suppliers do not compromise customer service standards by growing too quickly.\n\n'Winter uplift': Suppliers have been criticised for 'excessive' increases to bills by 30% or more\n\nOfgem will now have the power to request an independent audit of a company's finances that could result in a supplier being prevented from taking on new customers if they are failing existing ones. Companies will also be required to have 'exit arrangements' in place in case they fail. But the implementation of these new rules won't happen until next year at the earliest.\n\nDickson adds: 'As the retail energy market contracts and conditions get tougher for energy companies, we can expect more creative billing and more bankruptcies.\n\n'Consumers need to ask themselves \u2013 is it really in their best interest to have their energy account running into credit? Refunds from failed suppliers can be messy and drawn-out.'\n\nComparison website TheEnergyShop is aware of suppliers inflating direct debits 'without notice or justification' prior to bankruptcy.\n\nA 'winter uplift', as it is known, is common among suppliers. Joe Malinowski, founder of TheEnergyShop adds: 'Excessive winter uplifts of 30 per cent plus are simply another way for suppliers to hoard customers' cash to finance their businesses. Customers may want to avoid these suppliers.'\n\nSwitchcraft's analysis also shows 47 customers were billed by a new supplier before a single watt of energy was supplied \u2013 known as 'advanced billing'. In some cases, two months' payment is taken before an account has been transferred from an old supplier.\n\nMore than 230 customers waited more than a month to receive a credit refund. In 15 cases customers were waiting six months or more and of these, one was owed more than \u00a3700. More than one third of customers found their energy company 'difficult' or in some cases 'impossible' to contact when payment issues arose.\n\nFinally getting through to customer services did not always make a difference \u2013 with many reporting 'threats' or 'pressure' from staff when settling direct debit disputes.", "description": "Now is the time to claw back any overpayments made to energy suppliers during the summer - as a new report shows the sneaky tactics some companies employ to keep hold of customers' cash.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
