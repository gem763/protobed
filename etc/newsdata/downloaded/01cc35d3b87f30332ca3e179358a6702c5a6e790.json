But now climate change is threatening its survival.\n\nHornbeam trees overlooking the estate\u2019s Grand Canal died this summer, and in Marie Antoinette\u2019s Trianon gardens, the beeches are withering. The worry is that these weren\u2019t only varieties from the era of Louis the XIV, but also new plantings meant to withstand the effects of global warming. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said Alain Baraton, Versailles\u2019s chief gardener, pointing to shrivelled hornbeams and the parched leaves of once-luscious chestnut trees. \u201cI\u2019m forced to dump history and be pragmatic.\u201d\n\nNorthern Europe\u2019s normally temperate weather is rapidly becoming hotter and drier, forcing gardeners on the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) park to adapt. The stately elms, chestnuts and birches that were favoured by French royalty are being selectively replaced by species that stand better chances of resisting higher temperatures, new parasites and more volatile precipitation patterns.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Trees are one of nature\u2019s biggest forms of carbon storage. The European Environment Agency estimates forests absorb 13 per cent of all of the European Union\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. But more frequent droughts and increasingly violent storms put the region\u2019s woodlands at risk. \u201cTrees used to have hundreds of years to adapt, but they don\u2019t have that time anymore,\u201d said Xavier Bartet, an officer in France\u2019s National Forestry Agency. \u201cAnd in nature, if you can\u2019t adapt, you die.\u201d\n\nThe effects are being felt across Europe. About 50 million spruce trees are believed to have perished, with extensive damage to larch, oak, beech and pine varieties, according to Gert-Jan Nabuurs, forestry expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. In eastern Germany, pine canopies have been bleached a sickly brown with ground water the lowest since records began in 1961, according to the country\u2019s DWD weather service. Charred stumps point to a disturbing new trend of wildfires. The BDF forestry association estimates 100 million German trees have died in droughts and storms since 2018.\n\nEurope is particularly exposed to climate change, because its weather is dominated by the jet stream. The flow of moist winds from the Atlantic typically brings in ample precipitation to maintain the region\u2019s ecosystem, but kinks have developed as arctic ice melts, causing air to blow in from the Sahara with increasing regularity. Warmer temperatures are changing growing patterns, with chestnut trees in Portugal struggling in lower altitudes, where they once thrived.\n\nStorms fuelled by warmer temperatures are also a problem. The risks were evident last October, when the Italian peninsula was pounded by storm gusts exceeding 124 mph (200 kms an hour), damaging 105,020 acres (42,500 hectares) of forest. The Comelico Dam near the Austrian border was covered with trees battered into the Piave river. For centuries, such timber was brought to Venice on rafts to be used for foundations of the lagoon city\u2019s historic \u201cpalazzi.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not bad everywhere. Sweden has planted more trees than it cuts down since the 1920s, and today there is almost twice as much wood supply than at the start of 20th century, but then there\u2019s the new problem of wildfires. In Finland, climate change is speeding up tree growth, but the Nordic country \u2013 wary of extreme weather and the spread of pests such as bark beetle \u2013 is more actively managing its timber resources including using selectively bred seedlings.\n\nDying woodlands could mean that greenhouse gases build up even faster. Concerns have led to mounting public pressure. A Danish broadcaster held a telethon last weekend, raising \u20ac2.4m ($2.6m) from viewers to plant more than 900,000 trees, and an artist created a mock forest inside a football stadium in Austria to raise awareness. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming European Commission president, called protecting the environment the bloc\u2019s \u201cmost pressing challenge.\u201d\n\nWhile European leaders have vowed to act, the situation is complicated by an economic slowdown and concerns about financing. In Germany \u2013 where a summer heatwave threatened to buckle highways and the receding Rhine river risked halting shipping for the second straight year \u2013 Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government on Friday is due to decide on measures to get its climate goals back on track.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy fix. Efforts to make forests more robust include replanting Turkish oak trees in France and testing seeds from drier areas in the central Loire valley for future wine barrels. But the measures are a crapshoot. At Versailles, about 50 per cent of new saplings die in the first year, and messing with local ecosystems can have damaging effects on native varieties, with groups like Ireland\u2019s Woodland League seeking to halt the introduction of new species. \u201cAll we do is still experimental, and it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Brigitte Musch, chief of climate-change research for the French forestry agency. \u201cWe are under pressure to work fast, for things that will matter for the generations to come.\u201d\n\nThe Versailles estate, which spends about \u20ac3m annually to maintain its grounds, is the elite of Europe\u2019s forests. The wider reality can be seen behind a rusty fence at the end of the grounds at the Arboretum de Versailles-Chevreloup. The conservation park has a budget less than 5 per cent of the palace\u2019s, and the effects of low rainfall and record heat were evident in the balding canopies and shrivelling Patagonia trees.\n\nTo avoid such a fate, France\u2019s forestry agency is teaming up with counterparts in Europe and Turkey to develop software to determine what varieties will have to be planted in the years to come. The software, which is working with a worst-case scenario of summer temperatures rising as much as 5.3C (below the latest forecast), will be translated in English to be usable by peers worldwide.\n\nAt Versailles, future-proofing the grounds is being meticulously orchestrated. The estate is building a database of all its vegetation, insects and animals. The trees will be given more space to capture the water in the soil and retain humidity. The goal is to keep the spirit of the Sun King\u2019s grandeur alive into the next century.\n\n\u201cVisually, the palace visitors won\u2019t see any major changes,\u201d said Baraton, the chief gardener. \u201cBut silently, everything is changing.\u201d\n\nWith assistance from Bloomberg\u2019s Dan Liefgreen, Jesper Starn, Kati Pohjanpalo and Joao Lima.\n\n\u00a9 Washington Post", "description": "The manicured estate of the Palace of Versailles\u00a0was designed for an absolute monarch and withstood the French revolution.
