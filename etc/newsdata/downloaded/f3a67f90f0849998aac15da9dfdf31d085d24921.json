A win would have moved the Basque Country club to the top entering the weekend.\n\nMallorca, back in the first division after a six-year absence, was 14th in the 20-team standings with four points from four matches.\n\nMallorca still had time to find the net after Aduriz\u2019s miss for Athletic from the spot, but forward Alex Alegria was called offside.\n\nAthletic\u2019s penalty was awarded for hand ball after video review. Mallorca\u2019s penalty came after a foul against Japanese teenager Takefusa Kubo, who is on loan from Real Madrid.\n\nBoth teams hit the woodwork in the game at Mallorca\u2019s Son Moix Stadium.\n\nDefending champion Barcelona hosts Valencia on Saturday, while Real Madrid hosts Levante.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Both teams failed with late penalty kicks as Athletic Bilbao missed a chance to take the Spanish league lead after being held by promoted Mallorca to a 0-0 draw on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
