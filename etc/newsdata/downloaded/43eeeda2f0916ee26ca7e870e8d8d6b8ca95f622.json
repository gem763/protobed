In question is whether the U.S. leader sought to make military aid conditional on Ukraine investigating his political rival, whose son used to do business there.\n\nOn Friday, the country\u2019s top prosecutor remained staunchly on the fence. Important cases opened before he was appointed just weeks ago will be reviewed, he said, without indicating how long the process will take or where it will lead.\n\nHis stance is understandable.
