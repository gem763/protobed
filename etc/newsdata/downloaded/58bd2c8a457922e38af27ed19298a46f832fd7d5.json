We drink a whopping 165 million cups of tea, and 95 millions cups of coffee, every day. It's enough to make your forget that in many other countries, a kettle is a non-standard kitchen appliance. The poor souls.\n\nKettles broadly fall into two categories: electric and stovetop. Stovetop kettles are more traditional: you simply fill them up, place on the hob (most should work for all hob types) and wait for the whistle. It's a romantic, Instagram-friendly way to boil your water \u2013 but compared to an electric kettle, stovetop kettles take an age to boil. In my hunt for the best kettle out there, I decided to focus on electric models for that reason alone (interestingly, the energy efficiency of the two methods is roughly equal \u2013 as this in-depth article explains.)\n\nThe good news is that electric kettles are still very simple (basically a heating element in a container), which means you don't have to spend loads to buy a good one. During testing, I found the more expensive models, which have more features, tend to feel sturdier; but nonetheless, a \u00a330 kettle should do the job just fine.", "description": "It's barely an exaggeration to say that the kettle is one of the most important tools in British life.", "authors": ["Tom\u00e9 Morrissy-Swan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/recommended/2018/12/07/Best-kettles-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7BLl5GhlglFoSG-9WaViRts.png", "published_at": "2018-12-07"}
