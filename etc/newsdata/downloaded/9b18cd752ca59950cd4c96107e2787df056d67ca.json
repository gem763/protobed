Members grumbled they weren\u2019t getting a share of company profits and wanted union leaders to prove their worth.\n\nGM executives were wary of a market downturn and wanted to spend billions on new technologies. They determined they needed to come up with $6 billion in cuts\u2014in six weeks.\n\nFrom these embattled corners negotiations began in Detroit this summer, and broke down on Sunday, when the UAW called its first nationwide strike at GM in more than a decade. The action sent tens of thousands of factory workers to the picket lines and halted production at more than 30 U.S. plants.\n\nThe work stoppage is among America\u2019s largest private-sector walkouts in years. Analysts estimate it is costing GM $50 million to $100 million a day in lost profits. GM\u2019s competitors\u2014 Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2014have much riding on the outcome of this stalemate. The UAW will use the contract agreed to at GM as a template for talks with the other two U.S. car makers.\n\nIt\u2019s a confrontation that has been building for years, with the two big institutions, both under acute pressures, driven by diverging goals. Negotiations continue this week. Even after a contract is eventually reached, the relationship may have permanently shifted.\n\nOn one side is GM\u2019s Chief Executive Mary Barra, who is trying to shed the auto maker\u2019s long-held reputation for ignoring problems. She is aiming to show Wall Street that today\u2019s GM is leaner and more assertive than the one that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago.\n\nOn the other side is the UAW, an organization that once ruled the auto industry but is now confronting declines and dissent from within\u2014fueled in part by the popularity of President Trump among its members.\n\nAs U.S. auto industry sales slow, following a historic run, both sides are trying to lock in a new labor agreement that will protect their respective livelihoods in the years ahead.\n\nUAW leaders say they called the strike after bargaining for a new four-year labor agreement hit a standstill, with the two sides far apart on issues ranging from wages and health care to the use of temporary workers.\n\nThe tone had been set months before contract talks officially started. UAW leaders met at an Atlantic City casino in May to discuss tactics, and an air of anger permeated the meeting, say people who attended.\n\nTwo months earlier, GM had shuttered a major assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, letting hundreds of people go, and the nation\u2019s largest auto maker by sales was planning to close three more U.S. factories.\n\nGary Jones, the UAW\u2019s president, told the Atlantic City gathering that GM\u2019s decision had fundamentally changed the union\u2019s relationship with the company and would cast a shadow over negotiations.\n\n\u201cThey were saying there was a different feeling\u2014a shift from upper GM management,\u201d said Dennis Earl, a union leader from Toledo, Ohio, who attended the meeting. \u201cThere was arrogance.\u201d\n\nGM executives have defended the plant closures as the type of bold move that the old GM would have shied from. The two largest of the factories set to close\u2014the one in Lordstown and another in Detroit\u2014were sputtering along at less than half their capacity, building cars that a dwindling number of people want to buy.\n\nWall Street analysts applauded the decision, saying GM was taking steps to guard against a downturn.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra spoke with UAW Vice President Terry Dittes at a GM plant in Lake Orion, Mich., in March.

Following a crippling 54-day strike in 1998 at GM\u2019s assembly plant in Flint, Mich., she was assigned to an internal-communications post to mend relations between UAW members and the company.\n\nDuring her CEO tenure, though, relations between GM and the UAW have frayed.\n\nIn the last round of collective bargaining, in 2015, GM executives were upset over a getting stuck with a contract that was costlier than they originally forecasts, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nUnion officials and GM negotiators had worked together for months in relative harmony, and GM executives believed UAW leaders would pick GM as the lead company in negotiations. The union instead chose Fiat-Chrysler, which agreed to a more expensive deal that GM then had to follow, the people said.\n\nThat same year, GM confirmed it would import a small Buick crossover called the Envision from China to the U.S. Union leaders took to calling the model \u201cthe Invasion.\u201d\n\nFor much of her nearly six-year tenure, Ms. Barra has worked to fix GM\u2019s overseas business, including selling the company\u2019s European operations, which lost money for two decades.\n\nUAW strikers in Flint this week.

GM posted a record operating profit of $12.8 billion in 2016 and again in 2017, before slipping to $11.8 billion last year.\n\n\u201cYou guys are kicking butt,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told Ms. Barra at an investor conference in January. \u201cPrivate investors come up to me all the time lately saying \u2018Where does this come from? What GM is this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nStill, Ms. Barra has had to fend off two separate activist investors and contend with a stalled stock price.\n\nLast year, GM further incensed UAW workers by revealing it would build a new Chevy Blazer, long a recognizable American nameplate, in Mexico\u2014news that landed on the same day the company laid off a shift of factory workers at the Lordstown plant.\n\nLast October, Ms. Barra convened her top leadership team in a conference room at GM\u2019s headquarters and said the company needed to better prepare for the eventual downturn in U.S. auto sales, according to a person at the meeting. She gave her team six weeks to find $6 billion in annual cash savings, according to the person.\n\nNewly appointed Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara was sharpening GM\u2019s focus on cash flow, believing it needed to improve to better court investors, according to other people familiar with her role. With Ms. Barra\u2019s leadership team, she sought to tackle a problem that had long dragged on GM\u2019s finances: too many North American factories operating on barely one shift.\n\nThe week after Thanksgiving, GM sought to roll out a restructuring plan: Four U.S. plants and one in Canada were set to be \u201cunallocated,\u201d meaning no vehicles would be built there in the near future. The move put more than 6,000 factory workers at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nOn a conference call with Wall Street analysts just after Thanksgiving, Ms. Barra and Ms. Suryadevara explained that the cuts would boost annual cash flow by $6 billion by 2020, helping GM to fund technology for electric and self-driving vehicles, and to protect its bottom line in a downturn.\n\nOn the 22-minute call, the executives mentioned cash flow or cash savings more than a dozen times. They didn\u2019t discuss how many jobs would be affected or the impact on employees.\n\nGary Jones, the UAW\u2019s president, at a Labor Day parade in Detroit this month.

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s top bargainer with GM, called the move an affront to workers who he says stuck by the company during its darkest days.\n\nThe UAW\u2019s membership, which last peaked at 1.5 million in the late 1970s, tumbled to roughly 400,000 last year, the result of years of corporate downsizing and layoffs by the Detroit car companies and more work being sent to Mexico, where labor is less expensive.\n\nThe union has tried to build clout by trying to represent workers at the foreign-owned car plants in the U.S. South, but organizing drives at Nissan Motor Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and others have failed. This summer, workers at Volkswagen AG \u2019s assembly factory in Tennessee voted to reject the union\u2014the UAW second defeat there in five years.\n\nRank-and-file members are getting impatient, seeing the profits GM is posting and pressing for more in pay and benefits. More workers are placing their faith in President Trump, whose views on trade, tariffs and reviving U.S. manufacturing have resonated. About one-third of UAW members voted for Mr. Trump in the last election.\n\nIn June of last year, the UAW elected as its president Mr. Jones, the union\u2019s former chief accountant and a top official in its Missouri-based Region 5 office, which covers 17 states. Unlike many past UAW presidents, Mr. Jones was inexperienced in auto-industry bargaining and had yet to negotiate a national contract with one of the car manufacturers.\n\nGM workers rallied outside the Lordstown, Ohio, plant in March.

He told members the union was increasing its strike pay from $200 to $250 a week.\n\nMr. Jones is under pressure to show strength as a Justice Department investigation into leadership corruption dents workers\u2019 confidence in their top brass.\n\nAt Detroit\u2019s Labor Day parade earlier this month, about a dozen disaffected UAW workers protested Mr. Jones\u2019s presence, calling for his resignation.\n\n\u201cI have zero trust they will get me a fair contract,\u201d Jeff Herrington, a UAW worker at Ford\u2019s suburban Detroit transmission plant, said before the parade.\n\nFormal contract talks began in July with all three car makers. In late August, federal agents searched the homes of Mr. Jones and his predecessor Dennis Williams. Neither man has been charged with a crime. The union has said it is cooperating with the investigation and the search warrants weren\u2019t necessary.\n\nUnion leaders pressed ahead with contract talks, and shortly after Labor Day, the UAW picked GM to take the lead in negotiations.\n\nThe week the UAW\u2019s contract with GM was set to expire, agents arrested another high-ranking union leader\u2014this one a close associate of Mr. Jones. The union leader hasn\u2019t responded to the charges.\n\nA striker in Flint this week. Photo: Nick Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nGM executives asked the UAW to extend talks, figuring the union\u2019s bargainers would want to push back the deadline, say people close to the discussions.\n\nAround 10 p.m. Saturday, two hours before the existing contract was to expire, GM added elements to its offer to avert a strike. Its proposal included wage increases, new jobs and a plan to salvage the Detroit factory, according to a person close to the negotiations.\n\nUAW leaders weren\u2019t convinced, telling members later in a letter that GM waited too long to make what they considered to be the company\u2019s first serious offer.\n\nRather than return to the table the next day, more than 100 union officials gathered in a windowless ballroom at GM\u2019s headquarters, where negotiators had been bargaining with the company, according to people close to the talks.\n\nMr. Dittes, the union\u2019s lead bargainer with GM, told them that the two sides \u201cwere miles apart and GM isn\u2019t negotiating in good faith,\u201d one attendee said.\n\nThey held a vote on whether to strike. The proposal received a resounding \u201cyay,\u201d said people who were in the meeting. The \u201cnay\u201d vote was met with silence.\n\nWrite to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com", "description": "GM wants to show Wall Street it is more assertive than the company that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago.
