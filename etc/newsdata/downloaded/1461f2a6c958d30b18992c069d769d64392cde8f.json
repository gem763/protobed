The union\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cThe figures banded about by Ryanair when it comes to our pay claim are simply ridiculous, bumped up, fictitious spin.\n\n\u201cThey need to put a serious offer on the table so that this industrial action, brought about by the company\u2019s flat refusal to even look at the needs of its workforce and passengers, can be brought to an end.\u201d\n\nRyanair says: \u201cWe have invited Balpa to meet with Ryanair to resume negotiations, and to call off these unsupported and failed pilot strikes, but Balpa have refused to take these repeated invitations.\u201d\n\nWhile the two sides remain a long way apart, the airline has rostered volunteers to work on their days off to replace striking pilots.\n\nAn airline spokesperson said: \u201cOn behalf of our customers and their families we wish to sincerely thank all our UK pilots who have not supported this Balpa strike, and have confirmed they will work as rostered to protect the flights and travel plans of our UK customers and their families over the first week of September.\u201d\n\nAt the airline\u2019s biggest base, Stansted, one Ryanair flight to Hamburg departed an hour late.\n\nThere appear not to be problems with Ryanair flights at other airports. But British Airways, easyJet and Flybe have cancelled a number of flights, partly as a result of the French air-traffic control failure on Sunday.", "description": "British pilots employed by Ryanair are beginning a three-day strike \u2013 on a day when the airline is expecting to carry 160,000 passengers to and from the UK.
