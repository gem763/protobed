This has since led to a parade of witnesses testifying behind closed doors about the president's effort to pressure Ukraine, including allegations that he held back military aid as leverage.\n\nThe White House and the president\u2019s allies have maintained there was no such quid pro quo, though top diplomat Bill Taylor challenged such claims in testimony this week.\n\nMeanwhile, on Saturday, acting assistant secretary of state for Europe Philip Reeker testified on Capitol Hill. Reeker was not directly involved in the debate over military aid to Ukraine. Current and former officials reportedly have said that the aid issue was instead given to U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, and Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP ALLIES PUSH BACK ON 'QUID PRO QUO,' SAY ENVOY TESTIFIED UKRAINE INITIALLY UNAWARE OF AID HOLDUP\n\nAs part of the House impeachment inquiry, Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., on Friday also subpoenaed two Office of Management and Budget officials -- Associate Director for National Security Programs Michael Duffey and Acting Director Russel Voight -- for depositions next month.\n\nThe chairs on Friday also notified State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl of a subpoena compelling his testimony next month.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to appear at the deposition, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against the President,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter to Brechbuhl.\n\nAlso expected to testify this week are director for national security affairs at the National Security Council Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman on Tuesday, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger on Wednesday and Morrison on Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS DEMS OVER 'SHAM' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 'BEHIND CLOSED DOORS'\n\nMorrison\u2019s upcoming interview will be especially critical to the impeachment inquiry, after Taylor\u2019s damning testimony last week.\n\nTaylor testified that he had a phone call with Morrison, who told him that Sondland told top Ukrainian aide Andriy Yermak \u201cthat security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nBurisma Holdings is the Ukrainian natural gas firm where Hunter Biden was employed in a lucrative role on the board.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland-Yermak conversation. This was the first time I had heard that the security assistance not just the White House meeting\u2014was conditioned on the investigations,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has maintained that he has done nothing wrong, and is not concerned about the impeachment inquiry.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former White House deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman filed a lawsuit on Friday, asking a D.C. federal court whether he should comply with a congressional subpoena to provide testimony as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, or follow President Trump\u2019s direction to assert immunity.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
