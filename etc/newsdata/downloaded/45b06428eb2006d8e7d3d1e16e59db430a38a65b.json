It means this government wishes to win re-election by inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom.\n\n\u201cTheir approach is profoundly un-Conservative and, whatever its short-term effect, will do permanent damage to the reputation of the Conservative Party.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour.\u201d\n\nSir John predicted that any election held before Brexit is resolved would be \u201cthe most unsavoury of modern times\u201d and would do no more than produce another divided and fragmented parliament.\n\n\u201cIt would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity,\u201d he said. \u201cFar from healing the nation, it would scratch away at open wounds.\u201d\n\nSpeaking days before the opening of the annual Conservative conference in Manchester, Sir John described himself as being a lifelong Conservative like the 21 MPs expelled from the party for rebelling against Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance.\n\nAnd \u2013 in an apparent call for resistance to Mr Johnson\u2019s leadership \u2013 he added: \u201cI hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration.\n\n\u201cMost Conservatives are not a Brexit Party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe we have the right to ignore the voices of millions of others, whose opinions differ from our own.\n\n\u201cAnd we abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society.\n\n\u201cIt is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so.\n\n\u201cI hope that the Conservative Parliamentary Party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson may be planning to bypass a law blocking a no-deal Brexit by issuing an order to suspend it until after the scheduled date of Britain\u2019s EU withdrawal on 31 October, former prime minister Sir John Major has warned.
