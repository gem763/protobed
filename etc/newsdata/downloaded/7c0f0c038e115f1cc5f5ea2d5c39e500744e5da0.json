BTC\u2019s supply is limited to 21 million coins, and a significant proportion of that has apparently been lost forever. McAfee said:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get real, there are only 21 million bitcoins, seven million of which have been lost forever, and then, if Satoshi is dead, add a few more million.\u201d\n\n85% of BTC\u2019s total supply already mined\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the amount of mined BTC reached 17,850,000 on Aug. 1.\n\nThis means 85% of its total supply is now in circulation \u2014 leaving just 3.15 million coins to mine over the next 120 years.\n\nSince then, BTC has added more than 100,000 coins to its supply \u2014 and according to Blockchain.com data, it has a circulation of 17,968,000 as of now.\n\nBTC suffered a major sell-off last week when the major cryptocurrency lost $1,500 in less than a day for the first time in months. Later Bitcoin touched a new multi-month low \u2014 below $7,800.\n\nAt publishing time, BTC is trading at about $8,268 \u2014 down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, according to Coin360.\n\nAfter seeing some notable volatility this year, Bitcoin is still up more than 27% compared with this time last year, when it was trading at $6,500.\n\nBitcoin one-year price chart.
