(Picture: Greggs)\n\nAs the weather cools, we look forward to the most magical day of the year.\n\nNo, not Christmas.\n\nWe are, of course, talking about the launch of the Greggs Festive Bake, which this year is Thursday 7 November.\n\nBut for some lucky pastry devotees, that day can come earlier.\n\nToday Greggs launches a competition to find the cities with the biggest Greggs fans. The five cities with the most votes will be granted early access to the Festive Bake, a full week before its national launch.\n\nTo be in with a chance of getting your hungry paws on a Festive Bake before the rest of the country, entering is pretty simple.\n\nJust head to the dedicated competition website and vote for your city. Then ask your friends, neighbours, colleagues, and whoever else you spot in the street to do the same, as the five cities with the most votes shall reign supreme (by which we mean, they\u2019ll get the Festive Bake early).\n\nThe 20 cities in the running: Basingstoke\n\nBelfast\n\nBradford\n\nBristol\n\nBirmingham\n\nCardiff\n\nCarlisle\n\nEdinburgh\n\nGlasgow\n\nNewcastle\n\nManchester\n\nLeeds\n\nLiverpool\n\nLondon\n\nPlymouth\n\nPortsmouth\n\nNorwich\n\nNottingham\n\nSunderland\n\nSwansea\n\n\n\nThe city with the most votes will have the Festive Bake on sale on Friday 1 November. The Greggs tour will then head to each of the four runnerup cities each day leading up to the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and there\u2019s an extra special bonus for the biggest fan of them all.\n\nGreggs is also searching for people to carry an Olympic-style Festive Bake torch to signify the start of Christmas in each shop.\n\nAlongside that true honour, the biggest fans will also be given their own Greggs gift card worth \u00a3100, to be spent on all the Greggs their heart desires for the next 12 months.\n\nTo enter that bit, it\u2019s the same drill \u2013 head to the website and just make sure to fill in the box that asks: \u2018Why would you be the perfect Superfan to bring the Festive Bake to your city?\u2019\n\nReally sell yourself. This is important.\n\nDon\u2019t panic too much if you don\u2019t win, though.\n\nYou\u2019ll only have to wait a bit longer to buy a Festive Bake from your nearest Greggs. In case you haven\u2019t enjoyed the delightful treat, a quick explainer of its contents: The Festive Bake is made from succulent pieces of chicken breast, sage and onion stuffing and sweetcure bacon in a creamy sage and cranberry sauce, all wrapped in golden puff pastry with a crunchy crumb topping. Yum.\n\nMORE: Primark is now available to shop online but the prices are a little different\n\nMORE: Bride loses eight stone in a year to fit into her dream wedding dress\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Greggs is running a competition to find the city with the biggest Greggs superfans, so they can enjoy the Festive Bake a week early.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sec_40999341-56fe_1571136342.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
