Shouting, they pushed him into a corner beside the station and cheered as crowds punched and kicked him.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, he managed to walk away, dazed and bleeding from the forehead. Protesters also smashed video cameras and ticket booths in the station.\n\nSome started to trash fittings at the entrance of the mall. The protesters then spilled outside where they set fire to barricades made of cardboard, broken palm trees and other debris.\n\nPolice fired tear gas after coming under attack from bricks dug up from pathways.\n\nViolence has hit parts of the former British colony at different times over the last three months, but life goes on as normal for most people most of the time.\n\nHowever, pictures of petrol bombs and street clashes broadcast worldwide present a huge embarrassment for Beijing just days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has already called off a big fireworks display to mark the day in case of further clashes. China, which has a People\u2019s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong, has said it has faith in Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to solve the crisis.\n\nANGRY\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nA barricade on fire set by anti-government protesters is pictured during a demonstration in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China September 22, 2019.
