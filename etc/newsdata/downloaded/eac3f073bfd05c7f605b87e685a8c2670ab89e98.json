The 29-year-old had to save three break points for 2-2 in the first set, but was then broken twice as Federer whizzed away.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If he stayed behind, he found himself almost pinned to the back wall.\n\nIn the third Evans did finally scratch the surface, not only winning three points on the Federer serve but then converting the second of two break points, bringing them level on serve.\n\nIt was little more than an act of defiance, Federer breaking straight back to love and running away with the set, wrapping up victory in just one hour and 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cWhat did I do differently? Nothing,\u201d said Federer. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve just got to trust your team, your warm-ups, and everything you\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cMaybe Danny wasn\u2019t feeling it today, he played yesterday, maybe that was an advantage for me \u2013 and I took advantage.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Dan Evans was sent spinning out of the US Open on the end of a Roger Federer masterclass.
