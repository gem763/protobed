(AP) - Carnival Cruise Line and Alabama city officials have ceremonially signed an agreement to base a Carnival ship there for three more years.\n\nNews outlets report that Carnival official Terry Thornton called the agreement historic for the Miami-based cruise line. He says Carnival doesn\u2019t usually make such long agreements with cities the size of Mobile.\n\nThe City Council is expected to officially approve the agreement on Tuesday.\n\nMayor Sandy Stimson says Carnival brings lots of business, and he hopes the market will grow enough for Carnival to replace the Carnival Fantasy with a bigger ship.\n\nThornton noted that after about 10 years in Charleston, South Carolina, a 2,000-passenger ship like the Fantasy was replaced this year with the 3,000-passenger Carnival Sunshine.\n\nCharleston\u2019s population is about 148,000, Mobile\u2019s nearly 190,000.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carnival Cruise Line and Alabama city officials have ceremonially signed an agreement to base a Carnival ship there for three more years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
