We're confident this will bring great pleasure to many thousands of people over the coming years.'\n\nA statement on the entertainer's Facebook page read: 'I have always sold out in Swansea and was looking forward to the show, the audience in Swansea are a pleasure to work for and I am gutted that it has been cancelled.'\n\nHis manager Tony Jo wrote: 'How can a council go against the wishes of the people who voted them in!? Roy is one of the most popular artists ever to appear in Swansea and the crowds love him! Who has made a minority decision for the majority?'\n\n'It's like Brexit, what the people want doesn't seem to matter anymore, it's all about a few individuals making a lot of noise on the council! It's about time the majority out voted the minority. it's not a crime to have an opinion.\n\n'Everybody seems to be frightened to be honest. Grow a backbone and tell them to live or let live, everybody's got different tastes, not everybody likes Marmite but it doesn't mean the people that eat it are wrong! Chubby for Prime minister.'\n\nFans also attacked the decision, taking to the council's Facebook page to express their anger.\n\nMorgan Evans said: 'Looking to develop younger, family and diverse audiences'. Yeah, booking the Bay City Rollers for the 20th time will certainly accomplish that.'\n\nNigel Waters added: 'Who the hell are these guardians of our snowflake morals? I worked in the Grand for 30 years and never saw the show once as it did not appeal...but he certainly had his audience and he sold out. Thank goodness I don't work there now if this is the attitude of the theatre.'\n\nWhile Paul McAdam wrote: 'The second city of Wales now has a Labour administration that thinks it can censor what its residents can and cannot see at the theatre. I'm raging. So much for catering to all sections of the community.'", "description": "Roy Chubby Brown was due to appear in Swansea, Wales next April to perform at its Grand Theatre but the council has cancelled the show\u00a0because it 'doesn't reflect its values'.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20328570-0-image-a-48_1572358259015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
