Spearheaded by RSC Chairman Mike Johnson (LA-04), RSC Health Care Task Force Chairman Roger Marshall, M.D. (KS-01), and members of the RSC Health Task Force, the RSC Health Care Plan would protect vulnerable Americans \u2013 including those with pre-existing conditions, chronic illness, and serious health issues \u2013 while reducing premiums, deductibles, and overall health care costs.\n\nThe product of a year of research and stakeholder discussions, the RSC\u2019s approach to achieve more personalized, affordable care is designed to empower patients and doctors rather than bureaucrats and insurance companies.\n\nThe RSC Health Care Plan is presented as an alternative to Democrat proposals to double-down on the failing status quo or force all Americans off their current insurance plans \u2013 including those with employer-sponsored coverage \u2013 and into a one-size-fits-all, government-run health care system.\n\n\u201cThe RSC rejects the narrative that people with pre-existing conditions are thriving under the ACA. Democrats may be content to keep their heads in the sand, but conservatives will not stand by as millions of Americans suffer under a system in which they can no longer afford to use their insurance due to sky-rocketing premiums, egregious deductibles, and outrageous out-of-pocket costs,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe RSC has put forward a plan that will protect individuals with pre-existing conditions; empower Americans with greater control over their health care decisions and dollars; and personalize health care to meet individual needs. Congress ought to use it as a blueprint to increase affordability, quality, and choice in the U.S. health care system.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of our plan today, we are beginning a desperately needed conversation on how to save our country\u2019s broken health care system. The status quo is not working for hardworking Americans. The ACA does not adequately protect those living with pre-existing conditions, all the while premiums and deductibles continue to skyrocket for families,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWith the first phase of the framework introduced today, we will work with our colleagues to define legislation that will deliver the choice and control Americans want, the affordability they need, the ease they desire, and the quality everyone deserves.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the RSC Health Care Plan will:\n\nPROTECT Americans with pre-existing conditions\n\nExtend HIPAA portability and pre-existing condition protections that have long benefited Americans with employer-sponsored insurance to people moving into the individual marketplace.\n\nEstablish federally-funded, state-administered Guaranteed Coverage Pools to ensure individuals with high-cost illnesses have access to quality and affordable coverage.\n\nRepackage existing funding for ACA premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion to fund state-administered flex-grants to subsidize health insurance for low-income individuals.\n\nReduce regulatory barriers to give Americans access to quality care.\n\nEMPOWER Americans with greater control over their health care decisions and dollars\n\nReform the tax code to provide equal tax treatment in the employer and individual health insurance markets.\n\nUnleash Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by empowering Americans to use their money \u2013 tax-free \u2013 to cover more health-related expenses including insurance premiums, direct primary care service fees, and health sharing ministry dues.\n\nIncrease allowable, pre-tax contributions to HSAs from $3,500 to $9,000 for individuals and from $7,000 to $18,000 for families.\n\nPERSONALIZE health care to meet individual needs\n\nEliminate ACA mandates forcing Americans to pay more for coverage they do not want or need.\n\nEnhance HSAs in a way that allow for individuals to effectively own their personalized health care plans so they can take their plan from job to job.\n\nEmbrace and remove barriers on innovative health care solutions such as telemedicine, direct primary care, association health plans, and health sharing ministries.\n\n###", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://rsc-johnson.house.gov/sites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/featured_image/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-16%20at%204.51.47%20PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
