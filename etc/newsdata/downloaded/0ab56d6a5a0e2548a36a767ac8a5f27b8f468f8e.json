Ghani delivered a boilerplate stump speech praising local leadership to the crowd.\n\nWahida Shahkar, a spokeswoman for the provincial governor in Parwan, said the blast was carried out by a suicide bomber driving a motorcycle.\n\n\n\nHospital workers carry a wounded man after a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan Sept. 17, 2019. (Mohammad Ismail/Reuters)\n\n[With U.S.-Taliban peace talks canceled, Afghan president is on the hot seat]\n\nPresidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for the end of the month after the failure of peace talks with the militant Taliban insurgents. American and Taliban negotiators appeared close to a deal earlier this month after lengthy, largely secret negotiations, but the talks were abruptly called off by President Trump.\n\nThe Taliban in turn pledged to stepp up violence and have said it plans to derail the election.\n\nDespite security concerns, Ghani has held a series of large campaign rallies across the country in recent weeks without incident. Tuesday\u2019s rally, like others, was held amid tight security, with all attendees subjected to multiple searches. However, few of the more than a dozen other candidates have held similarly large-scale events due to security concerns.\n\nIn July, Ghani\u2019s running mate, Amrullah Saleh, barely escaped with his life when an attack on his office in Kabul left 20 people dead and 50 injured.\n\n\n\nAn election commission worker studies a document next to ballot boxes in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, Sept. 15, 2019. (Rahmat Gul/AP)\n\nAlso Tuesday, a blast occurred outside the compound housing the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, according to an Interior Ministry statement that did not include information regarding casualties. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack as well.\n\nGhani\u2019s government has emphasized security as Afghans prepare to head to the polls later this month. Some 72,000 security forces have been deployed to protect the vote, and more than 2,000 polling stations will be closed on Election Day due to inadequate security.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s presidential election has already been delayed twice due to security concerns.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid to go to the rallies because of suicide bombers,\u201d said Taj Mohammed Sadeqi, 60, a shopkeeper who lives in Parwan. \u201cPeace is more important that a presidential election. Ghani has not even been able to secure his own election rally.\u201d\n\nGeorge reported from Kabul.
