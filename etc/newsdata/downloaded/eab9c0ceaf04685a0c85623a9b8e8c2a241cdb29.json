Two hours later, her memory resets, and she's back to where she started when she woke up.\n\nThis is not a remake of the 1993 movie \"Groundhog Day.\" It's Riley Horner's life.\n\n\"I have a calendar on my door and I look and it's September and I'm like 'Woah',\" Horner told WQAD.\n\nCOLORADO WOMAN, 24, IN HEART FAILURE CREATES BUCKET LIST 3RD TRANSPLANT IS DENIED\n\nOn that fateful June 11, Horner was accidentally kicked in the head by a fellow student who was crowd-surfing during a dance. At first, her doctors simply dismissed it as a concussion and sent her home on crutches. But today, her condition remains a medical anomaly.\n\nHorner has suffered through dozens of seizures and countless hospital visits but doctors keep repeating there is nothing medically wrong with her.\n\n\"They can't see anything. You can't see a concussion though on an MRI or a CT scan.
