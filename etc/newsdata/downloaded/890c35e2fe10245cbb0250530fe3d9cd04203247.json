I was terribly ill when I wasn't doing it and it changes people's lives and I feel great. It's not like work.'\n\nSarah has just been signed by a global computer company, and works with entrepreneurs as well as family-run businesses.\n\nShe helped one woman increase her turnover by 70 per cent in a year, and she's just about to hit \u00a31million.\n\nTo enlist the guidance of a Shaman is becoming more popular thanks to Durek Verrett - boyfriend of Princess Martha Louise of Norway and a 'spiritual guide' to celebrities including Selma Blair, Nina Dobrev and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nShamans are believed to be able to communicate with spirits through magic, rituals and spiritual visions.\n\nThe 52-year-old, from Surrey, now offers 12-week courses costing \u00a37,500 to professionals to help them unlock their full potential\n\nMother Sarah Negus transformed her life after a 'chance' meeting with a Shaman which helped her overcome her illnesses and leave her husband\n\nSarah, pictured with her Golden Retriever Bear, said she managed to unlock herself after a Shaman said 'all the things I was too afraid to tell myself' in 30 minutes\n\nSarah said: 'I was always a strange kid. I didn't know that others couldn't see alternative stuff - I don't just see what's there, I see all sorts of other shapes, colours, forms.\n\n'When I look at people, I see their energetic form. So I closed it down; I didn't talk about it. I tried to be as normal as possible.\n\n'At 21, after developing quinsy, an abscess in my throat, I had an out-of-body experience and I was looking down at myself - and I thought, \"Yep, it's still there\".'\n\nSarah left her job in an investment bank in the City, then got married and had a son, who's now 23.\n\nSarah met the Shaman a few weeks after hitting 30, when she decided that she needed to improve her life\n\nAfter being in multiple, non-serious car crashes, she began experiencing daily migraines, depression, chronic fatigue, then developed ulcerative colitis.\n\nShe told how, at the age of 30, she realised she needed help to improve her life, and a few weeks later she had a 'chance' meeting with a shaman.\n\n'Within 30 minutes she told me all the things I was too afraid to tell myself,' Sarah said.\n\n'I cried for two days then I went back to her and asked her to help me. I saw her a lot. Twice a week and every weekend. I would sit in with her during shamanic journey meditations, I went to Peru with her.'\n\nSarah, pictured here in Miami, Florida, saw her Shaman twice a week and every weekend to begin with\n\nDuring her trip to the Amazon in 2005, Sarah took part in an ayahuasca ceremony. She was handed a 'big cup of black, goopy tea' which is hallucinogenic.\n\n'I was told it would open my awareness and bring forth my true purpose, as well as purge the body of physical and spiritual toxins,' she recalled. 'It was life-changing.\n\n'It helped me to understand the responsibility I have over my own life, that my inner world was more important than my outer world. We all have this immense personal power deep within us.'\n\nSarah, who was then working in property development, started to teach pilates as the exercise helped her to rehabilitate her body after the car crashes.\n\nShe said: 'I learned how to work with people with injuries. I always had \"magic\" hands and I started to use healing with movement and listening to people. As I got more confident with my shamanic energy, I started to use that too.\n\n'And that takes people out of what they know they are and shows them something else about themselves. It's not like meditation, it's channelled and it's unique to the client.\n\n'When you have the ability to hold this shamanic energy and to use it for the good of people, if you don't use it, you get ill because it gets stuck and becomes distorted, which is why I had all those car crashes and different illnesses.\n\nSarah, pictured on the beach with Bear, used to work at an investment bank in the city\n\nShe left her husband after the pair had counselling for two years to help resolve problems\n\n'The moment I stepped up and said, \"OK well I'm going to do this now\", I got better. Everything went. I cured myself while learning to use my shamanic energy effectively.\n\n'I didn't take any prescription meditation for any of these things, followed an alternative medicine route of homeopathy and self-care - gentle exercise, walking, rest - and shamanic journeying and self introspection.'\n\nSarah's 12 tips to become more successful 1. Become aware of the abundance you already have in your life. 2. Lean into gratitude for all you already have and 'feel rich'. 3. Celebrate all you receive on a daily basis - including growth in your business. 4. Set powerful intentions of what it is that you want to achieve in your life. 5. Resource yourself - make sure you're not running on empty; take time out to rest and have fun. 6. Take action. Do something every day towards your dreams - even if it's 15 minutes. 7. Track your money - you must know your own situation inside out. 8. Cultivate a positive money mindset - be mindful of what you are saying to yourself. 9. Invest in you - not just academically but to your inner wisdom and inner strength. 10. Know that you are the master of your energy and what you believe within you will manifest in your life. 11. The biggest investment you can make in your business, is within yourself and coming from a place of grounded certainty that you are success. 12. Decide that you are abundant and feel gratitude - the most powerful energy.\n\nAged 37, in 2005, Sarah found the strength to leave her husband - they had been having counselling for two years, but she said the decision still came as a shock to her ex.\n\n'My ex-husband was 15 years older than me. I was in my early 20s when we got together and I was looking for someone to save me,' she said.\n\n'But then when I didn't need saving and I needed to find out who I was, he couldn't manage it.'\n\nSarah then calls the next six years a 'shift' time, as it wasn't until 2012 that the marital home was sold; until then, she and her son had been living in rental properties.\n\nShe gave up her job and started coaching people - for free at first.\n\n'I was afraid of letting go of 30 hours a week, \u00a350 an hour. Except I was getting tired,' Sarah said.\n\n'So I went online and I did 150 hour-long sessions in the first month because I wasn't sure if I could do it.\n\n'I wasn't tired. I knew I'd made a huge difference to these people as I had glowing testimonials.'\n\nNow Sarah lives in a beautiful home on the outskirts of Surrey, and is in a happy long-term relationship with her partner, whom she met in 2015.\n\nShe's just finished writing a book about her experiences and regularly posts YouTube videos. She also offers online-only courses, with a six-week one starting from \u00a3597.\n\nHer courses comprise psychology, meditation and trance with therapeutic dialogue, shamanic journeying and some neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) - a practice which has been credited for elevating Barack Obama's speeches and restoring former tennis star Andre Agassi's form.\n\nShe works with entrepreneurs and CEOs using shamanic techniques that she says ultimately helps them to become more successful and earn more money.\n\nThese include a woman who worked at McDonald's, who is now earning almost \u00a31million a year teaching CEOs how to be more confident.\n\nAs well as offering courses, the entrepreneur has written a book and makes YouTube videos\n\nAnother woman who owns her own massage therapy business in London negotiated a \u00a310,000 job working for a celebrity client on location in the days after her course had finished.\n\nAnd a third man whose construction company was about to go bankrupt got four deals in six weeks after working with Sarah.\n\nSarah said: 'I come in as a facilitator to facilitate change and I'm able to inspire people to see themselves in their future life, because I can see that and they can't.\n\n'I help them with what was holding them back in their business and most of the time it's themselves and that feeling of self-doubt and being afraid of change.\n\nSarah, left at the Sydney Harbour Bridge and right in Athens, Greece, also stopped using prescription medicines, instead opting for homeopathy, after her visit to the Amazon\n\n'I look at their past, to see what's conditioned them and how we can overcome it, and I look at what their future self is, what they want to be known for, what impact they want to make.\n\n'The vision in the middle is the two things intertwining and becoming richer. Ultimately, if you want to get to the next level in your business, we will work out a strategy for that.'\n\nSarah added: 'We are taught success is a materialistic goal and encouraged to work hard towards it, we are never taught to work towards knowing ourselves deeply. My experience in my life and with my clients is that chasing a goal or an outcome is a hollow trophy if there is no inner strength, purpose or deeper meaning felt within.\n\n'Ultimately, success found in a job, career or in money is transient; success found within is something intangible yet priceless.'", "description": "Mother Sarah Negus, 52, from Surrey, found the strength to leave her husband and also had her illnesses cured after a meeting with a Shaman who explained all her problems in 30 minutes.", "authors": ["Carol Driver For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20049330-0-image-a-4_1571768511336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
