Why is the bank banning Post Office withdrawals from January?", "language": "en", "text": "Furious customers last night savaged Barclays for axeing cash withdrawals at post offices.\n\nAround 15million transactions were carried out last year \u2013 41,000 a day \u2013 yet the bank is to end the vital service from January.\n\nThis will leave its customers with longer journeys to access their savings at fast-disappearing cash machines and high street branches.\n\nThe Mail has been campaigning to protect local post offices and maintain access to cash for the vulnerable or isolated. High streets lost 3,300 bank branches, around a third of the network, between January 2015 and August 2019 [File photo]\n\nThe Mail has been inundated with letters and emails from customers threatening to desert Barclays.\n\nAnd an online petition calling for the decision to be reversed has already attracted 4,000 signatures.\n\nMPs told Barclays boss Jes Staley to perform a \u2018rapid U-turn\u2019 yesterday.

Anger at the move has been amplified by the bank\u2019s programme of closures\n\nBosses have shut 481 branches since 2015, leaving many communities reliant on post offices.\n\nBarclays will reportedly save only \u00a37million a year from the decision. This compares with a \u00a33.5billion profit last year and the \u00a37.2million Mr Staley has been paid in the past two years.\n\nWendy Dale, 65, a Barclays customer of 40 years from Broome, Worcestershire, said: \u2018I\u2019m incensed, Barclays are being hugely arrogant and contemptuous of their customers. They must reverse their decision or I will move bank.\u2019\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour chairman of the Commons business committee, said: \u2018The outcry which has followed this inexcusable decision should jolt Barclays into coming to their senses and ensure they do the right thing by performing a rapid U-turn on this policy.\n\n\u2018Stopping customers accessing their own money from post offices is a dreadful move from Barclays and they should read the writing on the wall and reverse their decision.\u2019\n\nPeter Hall of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters said Barclays had claimed customers would not be inconvenienced \u2013 and this was \u2018deliberately misleading or desperately misguided\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018In a great many cases, there simply will be no alternative solution for these customers. It is not too late to reverse it before they see an exodus of customers.\u2019\n\nThe Mail has been inundated with letters and emails from customers threatening to desert Barclays. And an online petition calling for the decision to be reversed has already attracted 4,000 signatures [File photo]\n\nBarclays customers will still be able to deposit cheques and cash and check their balances at post offices but they will no longer be able to withdraw money using their debit card. At present they can take out up to \u00a3300 a day over the counter.\n\nResponding to criticism of its plan, the bank has said it would ring-fence 100 rural branches and partner with 200 local retailers to provide a cashback service.\n\nBut James Lowman of the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents over 33,000 local shops, said: \u2018Retailers should not be expected to have to take on additional services just because banks don\u2019t want to benefit their customers by providing a cash machine or withdrawal service at the post office.\u2019\n\nIn the case of one town \u2013 Grassington in North Yorkshire \u2013 Barclays customers will now not be able to access their savings because the last branch has shut and there is no cash machine.\n\nWhen the bank closed in May, Barclays placated customers by telling them they would still be able to access banking services at the post office 70 yards away \u2013 a promise that lasted only 137 days.\n\nPauline Clanchy, 77, from Bisbrooke, near Uppingham, Rutland, said: \u2018They\u2019re putting profit before customer service, I\u2019m annoyed especially after our local Barclays branch closed down.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no bus service in our village and we\u2019re starting to feel isolated. I\u2019m considering moving bank if they don\u2019t reverse their decision. To go to the nearest branch is a 20-mile round trip.\u2019\n\nJohn Moorhouse, from Shipham in Somerset, called the cash withdrawals ban a \u2018retrograde step\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018All the local Barclays banks closed years ago, the nearest ones now being in Weston-super-Mare, a 24-mile round trip, and Bristol, a 32-mile round trip.\u2019\n\nThe withdrawal ban is expected to affect tens of thousands of Barclays customers in rural areas even though, \u2018subject to arrangement\u2019, they will still be able to withdraw cash by cheque.\n\nBosses have shut 481 branches since 2015, leaving many communities reliant on post offices. Barclays will reportedly save only \u00a37million a year from the decision [File photo]\n\nA deal known as the \u2018banking framework\u2019 allows customers of 28 high street banks to withdraw and deposit cash and pay in cheques at post offices.\n\nThe network processed five million cash deposits on behalf of Barclays last year.\n\nThe contract between the Post Office and banks lasts until 2022. It provides vital income for struggling postmasters, who receive commission each time they carry out banking services.\n\nThe Mail has been campaigning to protect local post offices and maintain access to cash for the vulnerable or isolated. High streets lost 3,300 bank branches, around a third of the network, between January 2015 and August 2019.\n\nA Barclays spokesman said: \u2018Our commitment means none of our customers will be without access to cash. Despite removing cash withdrawals, our financial contribution to the Post Office for the banking framework will actually increase in 2020.\u2019\n\nJohn Mann, a Labour member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: \u2018Barclays are out of touch with the public mood. When cash machines and branches have been removed, the post office remains a key part of the financial infrastructure.\u2019", "description": "Furious\u00a0customers last night savaged Barclays for axeing cash withdrawals at post offices.
