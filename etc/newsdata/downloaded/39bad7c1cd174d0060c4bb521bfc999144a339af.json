As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Gerrit Cole\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d as a Houston Astro is a tricky \u2013 and probably useless \u2013 concept to peg. A free agent after this season, during which he produced a Cy Young-caliber effort, Cole will likely move to greener pastures, giving him just two years in Houston.\n\nYet if Sunday night was it for Cole as an Astro, and the 110th pitch he fired in Game 5 of the World Series is the last he\u2019ll fling on their behalf, know this much: His Houston mission was very much accomplished.\n\nOvercoming a shaky Game 1 start that broke a 19-game winning streak that dated to May, Cole seized command of this Fall Classic on the Astros\u2019 behalf, pitching them to within a game of another championship with seven dominant innings.\n\nHe struck out nine Washington Nationals in seven innings and kept them at arm\u2019s length all night, summoning 100-mph fastballs all the way through his final inning and owning this crucial 7-1 victory that, for the first time, puts the Astros in command of this World Series.\n\nThey take a 3-2 lead back to Houston, with fellow Cy Young hopeful Justin Verlander battling Stephen Strasburg in Tuesday\u2019s Game 6. Zack Greinke lurks in Game 7, with a possible assist from Cole out of the bullpen.\n\nAfter that? Cole becomes a free agent, and with Verlander and Greinke already set to pull more than $20 million in over each of the next two seasons, the open market will provide Cole a ransom Houston likely cannot match.\n\nUMPIRES: Despite iffy calls, Nationals should blame for Game 5 loss\n\nTRUMP'S NIGHT OUT: Washington's baseball fans were ready for POTUS\n\nOnce a Pirate and now an Astro, Cole almost certainly will spend the bulk of his career in whichever city makes him the most desirable offer, be it Anaheim or Los Angeles or New York or any franchise that recognizes the wisdom of hiring a 326-strikeout guy just hitting his stride at age 29.\n\nBut these two years in Houston? To the Astros, they feel a lot longer than they look on his stat line.\n\n\u201cI feel like he\u2019s been here forever,\u201d says Astros center fielder George Springer, whose ninth-inning two-run provided the final margin. \u201cThe way he gets along with all of us in the clubhouse, the way he came in and bought into us as a team, how our team likes to play the game. He\u2019s extremely fun in the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cI honestly feel like he\u2019s been here for five, six years.\u201d\n\nCole struck out nine in the Game 5 win. (Photo: Patrick Smith, Getty Images)\n\nThe feeling\u2019s understandable. Cole has a staggering 40-12 record in Houston, including playoffs, and his October run this year will never be forgotten, and venerated should they win one more game.\n\nHe\u2019s posted a 1.72 ERA in his 36 \u2154 innings, striking out 47 and winning four of his five starts - including a surprise do-or-die game in the AL Division Series against Tampa Bay. He tipped the AL Championship Series in the Astros\u2019 favor by winning Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, and when Houston wrapped that up in six games, the pennant-winning glee was perhaps exceeded by the knowledge Cole would start Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nAnd then Cole went out and lost for the first time since May, his slider deserting him, then-20-year-old Juan Soto victimizing him for a homer and two-run double, and the 107-win Astros saw six months of handiwork undone.\n\nSunday, he snuffed out any trouble when it arose.\n\nThat man Soto got him again, hitting a seventh-inning home run for Washington\u2019s lone run, but it was his leadoff single in the second that really created trouble. Howie Kendrick followed with a near-gapper that put runners at the corners with nobody out.\n\nNo matter. Cole blew a 98-mph fastball past Zimmerman to set up a beautiful sweeping curveball that he flailed at for the first out. Cole then jumped ahead of Victor Robles 0-2 before inducing an inning-ending double play.\n\nThat preserved a 2-0 Houston lead that slowly grew on the strength of two-run homers, slow drips that made toppling Cole feel all the less likely.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of what happens when he pitches.\n\n\u201cAll year, the guy\u2019s been absolutely phenomenal,\u201d says reliever Joe Smith, who worked a scoreless eighth inning after Cole was lifted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bring his A-plus stuff Game 1, but we had a pretty good feeling he was going to come out and do pretty damn close to what he did tonight.\u201d\n\nSmith preceded Cole as an Astro by just a few weeks, signing as a free agent in December 2017; Houston stole Cole from Pittsburgh in January.\n\n\u201cWhen I signed with the Astros, I was so excited \u2013 a team coming off a World Series, had so many guys coming back. I was already pumped,\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd then when you see Gerrit Cole\u2019s name dropped, it was just like, \u2018Hohhhhh, this is real. Here we go.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo watch him come into his own over here the last two years has been so much fun, man. The guy keeps getting better. I love that. I told Will Harris, we\u2019re sitting there in like the fourth inning and I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, I love watching this guy pitch.\u2019 He\u2019s so much fun, especially when he\u2019s on your team.\u201d\n\nThat joy may be reserved for a different cast in 2020, a group that may look longingly at a championship ring Cole earned in 2019. The Astros are still 27 outs from making that reality \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re going to be the 27 hardest outs we\u2019ve had all season,\u201d says Smith \u2013 but they can thank Cole for giving them two shots at one win.\n\nEven if that was his last contribution.\n\n\u201cIt's been a blast since I've been here,\u201d Cole said before Game 5.\n\nThe feeling is definitely mutual, and now Cole and the Astros aim for the ultimate potential parting gift.", "description": "In what will likely be his final start with the Houston Astros, Gerrit Cole bounced back from a shaky outing in Game 1 to deliver in Game 5.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
