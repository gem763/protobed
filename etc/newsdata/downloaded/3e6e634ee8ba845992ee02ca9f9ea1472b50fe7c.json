Show Hide The supreme court of the United Kingdom was formally established on 1 October 2009. It is the ultimate court for hearing cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance, and is the final court of appeal in the UK, except for criminal cases heard in Scotland. The supreme court took over the judicial functions of the House of Lords, separating the judiciary from the legislature. It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords. The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court. Judges are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to whom a name is recommended by a special selection commission. The prime minister is obliged to recommend this name. The judgments in all decided cases from the court are published on the court's website.\n\nEadie agreed that parliamentary sovereignty was a \u201cprecious\u201d concept but added that it was no good \u201cturning up and shouting about parliamentary sovereignty\u201d because the phrase could mean different things. It can mean simply that parliament can \u201cmake and unmake its own laws\u201d. He said the common law did not, and should not, regulate the scheduling of parliamentary proceedings.\n\nEadie said the only \u201csure and proper guide\u201d for courts to intervene in cases was on the basis of already enacted legislation. Otherwise, he maintained, it moved the courts into the territory of \u201cparliamentary controversy\u201d.\n\nEadie continued: \u201cParliament has been considering Brexit for months and years. It has had the opportunity to make whatever legislative provisions it wants over that period.\u201d He said parliament could have taken action to resist being closed down. \u201cLegislation could have been added to control the prorogation after it had been introduced.\u201d\n\nLord Wilson said it was extraordinary no witness statement had been given to the supreme court confirming that the cabinet minutes giving reasons for prorogation were correct.\n\n\u201cNo one has come forward to say this is true,\u201d Wilson stressed. \u201cThey [the documents] are just floating around. Isn\u2019t it odd that no one has signed a witness statement that this is true? That these are the true reasons for what is done?\u201d\n\nBut Eadie said it was not normal for ministers to provide such witness statements. \u201cNo one has suggested that they are not the proper documents we need,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a myriad of reasons for the length of this prorogation. Reading these documents the evident aim was everyone was concerned to get to a place where a Queen\u2019s speech was produced.\u201d\n\nLady Arden, a supreme court justice, asked what the situation would be where a government prorogued parliament for one reason and then extended it for much longer for a different purpose. \u201cAre you saying that the courts would have no role in that situation?\u201d she asked Eadie.\n\nThe government\u2019s leading lawyer replied: \u201cI am. Our case is that this is political territory. It\u2019s not about judging the sufficiency [of the reasons] or the length of the prorogation. We submit that it\u2019s for the government to regulate the sessions of parliament.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court case has generated widespread interest. The first members of the public began queueing at 6.30am on Wednesday to secure a seat in court. The livestreamed broadcast of the proceedings in court attracted more than 4m requests to view during the course of Tuesday morning\u2019s hearing.\n\nIn written submissions, Lord Garnier QC, representing the former prime minister John Major, said it would be remarkable if the courts took the view \u201cthat there is nothing in law to prevent a prime minister from proroguing parliament in any circumstances or for any reason\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe fact that there are constitutional safeguards which operate on the well-intentioned [prime minister] is no reason for the courts to reject any possibility of intervening even in other cases.\u201d\n\nLord Pannick stays calm and Keen lacks interest at supreme court | John Crace Read more\n\nGarnier continued: \u201cThe reason why these proceedings are necessary at all is that the power of prorogation subverts the possibility of control by political means. Its effect is to deprive parliament of a voice throughout the period of the prorogation \u2026\n\n\u201cThe court is under no obligation to approach this case on the artificially naive basis that the handful of disclosed documents, which no one has been prepared to verify with a statement of truth, should nevertheless be assumed to be entirely accurate and complete even when members of the cabinet do not appear to believe them.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, put in fresh submissions on Wednesday, stating: \u201cThe exercise of power to prorogue parliament has the potential to affect/undermine parliament\u2019s ability to carry out its constitutional function of holding the executive to account and therefore engages the overarching principle of parliamentary sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe submission also contained a list of 13 bills that were before parliament before prorogation. They include the divorce, dissolution and separation bill and the domestic abuse bill.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "There are areas of political process that cannot be subjected to judicial standards, supreme court hears", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18684f7622d9b5b3ef1a8658a480b268b4729356/0_53_5445_3267/master/5445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=004f850aa8e3ae4d31bd666e9dc35a89", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
