There were none of the usual tricks accompanying \u201cunsanctioned\u201d protests.\n\nCentral Moscow was not shut down. The internet stayed on. There was no violence. No flying truncheons. No mass arrests. No harsh sentencing. Not even Lyubov Sobol, the emergent star of Moscow\u2019s summer of rebellion, was taken in.\n\nInstead, the rally ended up being the most peaceful since the opposition first took to the streets in July to protest their candidates being barred from next Sunday\u2019s municipal elections.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo what was different this time?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to be certain about the Kremlin\u2019s often contradictory thinking, but three things immediately come to mind.\n\nOn the one hand, Moscow is in the middle of a charm offensive, not least following President Trump\u2019s unexpected talk of readmission to the G8.\n\nHowever unlikely that prospect currently seems, Moscow is banking on a partial rehabilitation in Europe. To this end there are strong rumours of an imminent prisoner exchange with Kiev (already mistakenly reported by some outlets). Ukrainian cause celebre\u200b Oleh Sentsov has already been transferred from Siberia to Moscow.\n\nSecond, the opposition is now a split force, and some of its more radical elements stayed at home. Alexei Navalny, the man the Kremlin fears most, refrained from calling his supporters onto the streets. His focus has shifted from rallies to encouraging \u201cclever\u201d voting strategies at the municipal elections. That may have been interpreted as a retreat of sorts.\n\nThird, numbers were much reduced from similar protests of 27 July and 3 August. At a push, there may have been a few thousand attending. This opened up a tactical window for the Kremlin: it allowed them to avoid scandal ahead of Sunday\u2019s municipal elections while allowing attention to fall on the opposition\u2019s pathetic levels of street support.\n\nFor the opposition, it was, of course, a bittersweet afternoon. There was no blood on the streets. But it was also clear that the momentum of early August had died.\n\nWhether summer 2019 comes to leave a mark on future developments will likely depend on how young students \u2013 the protest\u2019s loudest voices and the most obvious victims of the subsequent clampdown \u2013 react to that disappointment.\n\nWill they develop widespread solidarity with their colleagues, dozens of whom are facing expulsion from university and/or up to eight years in prison? Or will they, like the generations before them, succumb to fear and find modes of conformity?\n\nThere is no obvious history to fall back on.\n\nRussia\u2019s security services have certainly turned to the Soviet playbook in terms of using night-time arrests and harsh punishments to increase the price of resistance. But that is where the parallels end.\n\nThere were few protests of this sort in Soviet Russia, and none fronted so obviously by the youngest generation. Back then, there was also no easy way to distribute information about repressions, bar the underground Samizdat publications.\n\nAnecdotally, Russia\u2019s young revolutionaries do seem much more carefree and ready to risk their personal freedom than older generations. Ironically, they also seem to have far fewer hang ups about his regime\u2019s repressive teeth than those who knew life before Putin, the former spy, took charge.\n\nThat underlying tension would suggest Saturday\u2019s soft-touch approach will prove an aberration rather than the rule.\n\nYours,\n\nOliver Carroll\n\nMoscow correspondent", "description": "On Saturday, at the opposition\u2019s protest march in Moscow, the Kremlin pulled off a surprise.
