He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis arose from a meeting of the One Nation caucus earlier in the week. It was the principal point and we also wanted to be assured again that the Conservative party wouldn\u2019t do a deal with the Brexit party.\n\n\u201cWe looked each other in the eye. I accept and believe the reassurances,\u201d he added. \u201cWe accept that no deal has to be a possibility and the One Nation caucus has by and large always been supportive of the government\u2019s policy. What we want is for that to continue.\u201d\n\nDowning Street made no comment on the meeting but some insiders thought Green had \u201coverinterpreted\u201d Johnson\u2019s position and the party may yet opt for an explicitly no deal platform to maximise its support from leave voters.\n\nCentrist Tory MPs are worried about what would happen if the party had to fight an election before Brexit has happened, after being forced into a three-month extension by the Benn act.\n\nPublicly, Johnson will not concede this is a possibility because he insists Brexit will happen on 31 October but most MPs think this is the central scenario \u2013 that his government will have to submit to the delay, possibly following a court order, and then he will immediately challenge Labour to an election to be held in late November.\n\nGreen and the other One Nation MPs demanded the meeting after a furious backlash among Conservative backbenchers against a briefing from an unnamed No 10 source that suggested the Tories would have to pivot to a no-deal position to outflank Farage.\n\n\u201cTo marginalise the Brexit party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of \u2018no more delays, get Brexit done immediately\u2019.\u201d\n\nJohnson told the centrist MPs at the meeting to \u201clisten to me, not the briefings\u201d, which is the same line he said to Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, when she raised the issue of the anonymous source messages in cabinet on Tuesday. The briefing in question is widely believed to have come from Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who is driving his Brexit policy.\n\nJohnson\u2019s chief whip, Mark Spencer, and his parliamentary private secretary, James Heappey, have received a series of complaints in the past 24 hours from backbench MPs who say they cannot stand on a no-deal platform.\n\nExpectations that up to 50 Tories would choose not stand for their party at the next election in protest could be an underestimate, according to one source. They said the group of 80 One Nation Tories were extremely worried about the government\u2019s potential direction.\n\nOne backbencher said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the only conversation taking place on the backbenches at the moment and it\u2019s going down very poorly. The whole One Nation group would struggle with it. I do not see that there\u2019s a democratic mandate based on a 52-48 referendum result for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cPeople are kicking off about it. I really don\u2019t see it\u2019s going to be the policy. It\u2019s a non-starter. There will be a haemorrhaging of Conservative members of parliament if this happens \u2013 they won\u2019t stand.\u201d\n\nAsked whether they would consider their own position, they said: \u201cYeah, I do feel like that.\u201d\n\nAnother Tory MP said: \u201cThere is lots of worry. Many MPs don\u2019t agree conceptually with it. Others think it paints us as extreme and not friendly to floating voters.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 100 MPs on the One Nation Tory WhatsApp group and many are said to have written comments critical of Johnson\u2019s potential strategy overnight.\n\nThe MP said they could not stand back and accept such a position because the \u201cunion would unravel like a gyroscope\u201d and there would be a significant increase to the national debt.\n\n\u201cDo I want my kids in the playground being told by another kid that their mum or dad lost their job because of your parent?\u201d they said.\n\nAnother backbencher said they did not believe Johnson would really pursue a no-deal Brexit and would simply go back to the public with a strategy of getting the deal done should he get a majority, and explain to voters that he would immediately overturn the Benn act, which compels him to request an extension to Brexit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second we will have a policy of no deal,\u201d they said.\n\nThe former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve who now sits as an independent, described the No 10 memo sent to the Spectator as \u201cpropaganda\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is a government that is now no longer governing in the traditional sense \u2013 it is engaging in propaganda.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the Benn act, which requires the PM to ask for an extension from the EU if there is no agreement by 19 October, remained watertight.\n\nShould Johnson try to get round it, he said the alliance of MPs campaigning against no deal were in a \u201creasonable place\u201d to counter him.", "description": "One Nation leader Damian Green says PM \u2018looked him in the eye\u2019 as he said party would not endorse no deal", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4850321962d6c4397468e2078575ae36fba847dd/0_56_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20d44086a00226e46e2f7f01b9ef919f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
