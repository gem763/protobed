This would, the government claimed, ultimately lead to better conservation.\n\nThe CJEU\u2019s ruling sets an important precedent for not only the protection of wolves, but also other species such as bears and lynx as well as a whole host of vital species like bats, snails and scorpions.\n\nThe case will now return to the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland for a final judgment.", "description": "Europe\u2019s top court has upheld the strict protection that EU law offers to wolves and other species in a judgment published on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/31/82/1000x563_cmsv2_0f813adf-d234-5ba0-a1a1-cc5b02578154-4223182.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
