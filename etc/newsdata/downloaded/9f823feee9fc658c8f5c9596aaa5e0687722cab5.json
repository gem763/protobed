Survivors, as first-team picks in 2019, are few and far between.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWow \u2013 Klopp turned that lot from eighth in 2015-16 to Champions League winners three years later.\n\nFrom back to front, his signings have been supreme value for money \u2013 from goalkeeper Alisson Becker to Virgil van Dijk, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane.\n\nContrast Klopp\u2019s surgery with United\u2019s line-up the same weekend: De Gea, Darmian, Jones, Smalling, Rojo, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Mata, Herrera, Martial, Rooney.\n\nYes, there have been changes. But United have spent \u00a3900m on new players since Fergie stepped down \u2013 and they have gone backwards.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\nWhere, in Ferguson\u2019s era, there used to be a nucleus of senior players calling the shots and leading by example for youngsters to follow, now there is too much dead wood cluttering up the squad.\n\nAnd where young players used to give United pace and energy, they are now having to carry the team \u2013 Marcus Rashford, in particular, is showing signs of the burden turning to fatigue.\n\nOne problem is that the kids United are turning to \u2013 Scott McTominay has been a shining light among them \u2013 are not coming into the first team with a winning mentality.\n\nMany of the youngsters coming through at Chelsea have won the FA Youth Cup several times, for instance, and their winning habit is making an immediate impact in the Premier League.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut United\u2019s kids have not been serial winners at youth team level. They are having to learn the art of winning on the shop floor, and that\u2019s a huge ask.\n\nAs I have said in previous columns, I am not in favour of ditching Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. I am not in favour of any manager getting the sack.\n\nHe spent \u00a3145m in the last window on Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, and all three look good investments, so he deserves at least another couple of windows.\n\nAnd Solskjaer\u2019s record over his first 29 games in charge of United has been better than Klopp\u2019s first 29 games at Liverpool \u2013 so transformation is not out of the question. It can be done.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut there is talk of former Juventus coach Max Allegri learning English with a view to landing a plum job in the Premier League.\n\nLook, Allegri preaches progressive, expansive football and he\u2019s a top-class coach \u2013 but if he comes in at Old Trafford, he\u2019s still going to have the same squad at his disposal, the same accumulation of mediocrity.\n\nLoyal supporters at Old Trafford won\u2019t thank me for this, but if I had to pick a combined United/Liverpool XI now, Paul Pogba would be the only Red Devils player to make the cut.\n\nAnd United fans won\u2019t enjoy this, either: In the visitors\u2019 dugout this weekend, under the beard and baseball cap, will be the best manager in the world.\n\nJurgen Klopp has shown it is possible to build champions of Europe without wasting \u00a3900m.", "description": "Klopp has spent under \u00a3400million since he took charge of Liverpool and their progress is showing up United's decline", "authors": ["Robbie Savage", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650702.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-United-v-Liverpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
