Those threats came during vaccination campaigns.\n\nSchaerer Juan-Pedro, who leads the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Afghanistan, says the two sides reestablished a \"common understanding\" about the Red Cross' work in Afghanistan.\n\n\"We welcome the acknowledgment of our humanitarian principles and renewal of security guarantees,\" Juan-Pedro said via Twitter.\n\nIt's not clear whether the Taliban have lifted their ban on the World Health Organization, whose work in Afghanistan includes a range of medical care along with vaccinations and polio eradication.\n\nShortly before the ban was announced in April, the WHO said it was hoping to protect more than 9.3 million children under the age of 5 from polio. At the time, three polio cases had been reported in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Red Cross, which says it has had a presence in Afghanistan since 1979, was criticized in 2010 for teaching Taliban fighters the basics of first aid and giving them medical kits. But the international aid group had scaled back its activities in northern Afghanistan after its aid workers died in the 2017 attack, which targeted an orthopedic center.", "description": "\"We welcome the acknowledgment of our humanitarian principles and renewal of security guarantees,\" says the Red Cross leader in Afghanistan.", "authors": ["Bill Chappell"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/16/gettyimages-1134386636_wide-62fb95fa076081c8bbedfb14438a94bbac700c31.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
