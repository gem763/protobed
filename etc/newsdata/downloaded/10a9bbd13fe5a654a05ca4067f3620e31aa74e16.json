Soz boys! You are amazing.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nChildren's TV presenters-turned-pop stars Max and Harvey, both 16, were among those who took to the stage during last night's show.\n\nWhile they were on stage, he was overheard slating the brothers after they made a comment about having eight million followers on social media.\n\nHe said: \"They say they've got eight million across social media but the reality is they've only got a chunk on each, and it's all the same.\"\n\nThe comment sparked a fury among fans and has since been tweeted by the official X Factor account and the twins themselves.\n\nThe X Factor account shared a video of Brendan's comment, adding: \"Who needs tanning lotion when @BrendanCole is bringing this shade! #XFactorCelebrity #XFactor.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe twins then responded to the message by offering to give Brendan and Jeremy a boost by doing a social media post together.\n\nThey tweeted: \"Hey @jqedwards @brendancole - there\u2019s this app called Tik Tok where we have a lot of awesome fans!!! Maybe we can make a post on there together sometime?\"\n\nThe sweet message prompted Brendan to apologise for his remark, and add: \"I don\u2019t know what you just said but ok!\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
