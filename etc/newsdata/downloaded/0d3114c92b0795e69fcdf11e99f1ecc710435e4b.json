I made the biggest mistake and the most \u00adstupid mistake you can make in a relationship.\n\n'I made the biggest mistake': Ben Foden PLEADED for ex-wife Una Healy's forgiveness for cheating on Saturday as he admitted their marriage was 'struggling for a number of years' (pictured 2016)\n\n'We seemed like a perfect match but people never know what happens behind closed doors. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Una and I were struggling for a number of years.'\n\nBen added that cheating on her was 'the final nail in the coffin' of their marriage.\n\nMailOnline have contacted Una's representatives for comment.\n\nUna and Ben married in Ireland in 2012 after four years of dating. They welcomed daughter Aoife shortly before they got married, and son Tadhg in 2015.\n\nCandid: The rugby player said he made 'the biggest mistake you can make in a relationship' as he added that it was 'the final nail in the coffin' of their marriage\n\nIn February, he admitted cheating on Una, telling The Guardian: 'At the moment anything that\u2019s published about me is never very good and pretty rightly so because I was the one who committed adultery.\n\n'At the same time, it wasn\u2019t the only reason for our divorce to go through. It\u2019s not ideal, but we\u2019re very amicable, we\u2019re getting through it, we\u2019re not the first people in the world to get divorced. We\u2019ve got two little kids we adore.'\n\nBen's tattered reputation suffered a further blow in 2018 after he used dating app Bumble to publicly announce his separation from the former The Saturdays star.\n\nHowever the couple confirmed their separation after six years of marriage in July last year, following his alleged affair with PR girl Becky Milne.\n\nBen hit the headlines in August when he tied the knot with Jackie Belanoff just two weeks after they first began dating.\n\nFamily: Una and Ben married in Ireland in 2012 after four years of dating. They welcomed daughter Aoife shortly before they got married, and son Tadhg in 2015\n\nThe former rugby ace made the announcement on his Instagram account and revealed that he had received Una's blessing for the marriage.\n\nA week after the nuptials, Ben reunited with his son and daughter as he gushed that 'the only thing that matters is family.'\n\nBut Jackie - it seemed - was not present, with a friend of the rugby player revealing to MailOnline that Ben chose to wed the New York socialite before making any introductions to his family.\n\nThe source also claimed that Ben likely married Jackie 'for a green card' and insisted the sportsman 'isn't interested in having more kids'.\n\nAmid an array of claims arising about Ben's dating activities prior to marrying Jackie, the rugby player's pal insisted he wasn't faithful during the start of their still-fledgling romance.\n\nThe insider told MailOnline: 'He was 100% seeing Jackie at the same time as [former Big Brother contestant] Rebecca Jane and the other women. He's probably done this [married her] for a green card to stay in the US.'\n\nThe insider added: 'Before he married Jackie, he and Rebecca Jane talked about having children and it was completely ruled out.\n\n'They discussed it at length and he definitely wasn't interested in having anymore kids.\n\n'But, I wouldn't be surprised if he does with this latest turn of events. His posts with his kids on Saturday are just a blatant attempt to repair his image and for attention.'", "description": "Speaking to The Sun on Saturday, the rugby player, 34, admitted that he hoped the singer, 37, would forgive him for his infidelity during their marriage.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19348098-0-image-a-206_1570322622576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
