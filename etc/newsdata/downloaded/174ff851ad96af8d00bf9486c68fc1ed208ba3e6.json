Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A year after losing in the first qualifying round of the U.S. Open and on the eve of her maiden Grand Slam quarter-final, the view from Flushing Meadows looks awfully different for 19-year-old Canadian Bianca Andreescu.\n\nFrom a 2018 year-end ranking of 178 to 15th place today, and with Rogers Cup and Indian Wells titles under her belt this year, Andreescu\u2019s rapid ascent is enough to give any tennis observer vertigo \u2014 even her coach, Sylvain Bruneau.\n\n\u201cHer journey, I guess, from a year ago has been pretty incredible. I\u2019d like to say that we kind of had a feeling that it was going to turn out this way but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Bruneau told reporters on the eve of the 15th seed\u2019s quarter-final match.\n\nBruneau, who hass worked with the hard-hitting Andreescu since March 2018, said he always \u201chad a lot of trust in her\u201d amid murmurs she could be tennis\u2019 next bright star.\n\n\u201cI always thought she was going to be a really good player. For me, that was a given,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that she was going to be able to get that quick of a turnaround and from a year ago she lost qualies here first round and a year later \u2013 no.\u201d\n\nHarnessing and focusing her natural intensity has been critical, Bruneau said the morning after her three-set, fourth-round thriller sent American qualifier Taylor Townsend packing and set up a clash with Belgian 25th seed Elise Mertens.\n\n\u201cI think it needed to be a little bit channeled and (she got) some tips on how to use all this energy,\u201d he said. \u201cI noticed very early on that she was a born competitor.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, who\u2019s had an injury-hit year and pulled out of Cincinnati to rest her body for the year\u2019s final Grand Slam, is getting more confident with added playing time, her coach said.\n\n\u201cI think her game was in place but she needed to really know what she was able to do,\u201d Bruneau said. \u201cI think she knows now.\u201d", "description": "A year after losing in the first qualifying round of the U.S. Open and on the eve of her maiden Grand Slam quarter-final, the view from Flushing Meadows looks awfully different for 19-year-old Canadian Bianca Andreescu.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425924578&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF82251-OCASP"}
