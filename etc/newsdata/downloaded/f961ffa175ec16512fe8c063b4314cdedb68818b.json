But I'd like to say well done to them, they've done a marvelous job for Ireland. They've made a difference in their time.\"\n\nFormer English teacher Schmidt took charge in 2013 and he and Best have overseen a purple patch since the disappointment of the 2015 World Cup, when an injury-hit side were run ragged by Argentina in the quarterfinals.\n\n\"Some of the wins he has had have set standards that are probably different than they were before he took over,\" argued Ireland lock James Ryan.\n\nLuke McGrath added: \"Everyone goes into championships now thinking we have a very good chance of winning \u2013- and that's all down to the work Joe has done over the last 6 1/2 years and we'll be sad to see him leave.\"\n\nSchmidt's legacy includes three Six Nations titles in six campaigns. Prior to his arrival the Irish had only won one in the previous 28 years -- the 2009 Grand Slam with Brian O'Driscoll as captain.\n\nThey entered the World Cup at number one in the global rankings, a position they occupied for two weeks before New Zealand resumed their long-term occupancy of the top spot.\n\n\"One word you associate with Joe Schmidt is detail,\" O'Driscoll, who played under Schmidt at both Leinster and Ireland, told AFP.\n\n\"I have never known any coach to scrutinize a game like him. He is an absolute rugby anorak, it is his passion as well as his profession. He is a bit of an insomniac too as he watches so much of it.\"\n\nO'Driscoll added: \"He isn't too schoolmasterly, but you want to know what you are talking about, don't go off half-cocked. He will sit you down too if needs be.\"\n\nIreland flyhalf Jonny Sexton said Schmidt brought a holistic approach to his job, adding he had left an \"unbelievable mark\" on Irish rugby.\n\n\"Rather than winning being everything, it was all about values and how you act day-to-day, on and off the pitch,\" he said.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting Schmidt bowed out against the revered New Zealand, the country of his birth.\n\n\"Inevitably, as a four-year-old kid when I first started playing rugby, barefoot rugby in Te Aroha in New Zealand, everyone looks up to the All Blacks,\" he said. \"You watch them as a young kid and all the way through.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "A \"broken\" Joe Schmidt signed off as Ireland coach with a crushing loss to his native New Zealand that condemned the Irish team to a record seventh World Cup quarterfinal exit.
