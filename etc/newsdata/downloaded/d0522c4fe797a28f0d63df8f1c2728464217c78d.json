However, the move sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.\n\nThe government said it would not take any further measures to counter violent protests and rejected rumours that mainland Chinese security forces were involved.\n\nShopping malls and several public facilities closed early on Thursday to avoid becoming targets of planned protests. However, there were few demonstrators, with only 60 activists gathering outside one police station.\n\nSeveral demonstrations are planned in districts across the former British colony on Friday and through the weekend, protesting against issues that include perceived police brutality.
