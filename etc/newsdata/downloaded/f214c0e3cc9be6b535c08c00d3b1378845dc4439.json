When he tried to access the lavatories during meal service, Laermer says, he accidentally spilled a drink on an empty seat. A flight attendant, believing he\u2019d thrown the beverage at her, reported him to the pilot.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen we landed in Westchester, there were three large police officers waiting for me,\u201d recalls Laermer, who owns a New York communications consulting company. \u201cThey took me into a windowless room, and they told me I had threatened a crew member.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn airline representative visited him while he was being detained to say he was on the company\u2019s \u201cno fly\u201d list, effective immediately.\n\n\u201cAll because of a drink,\u201d Laermer says.\n\nDelta didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Laermer\u2019s case. But his experience calls into question the conventional wisdom about blacklists: that you can only get on them for a serious infraction. Hotels and cruise lines also keep blacklists, and you can get banned from travel for all the reasons you might expect \u2014 and some you might not.\n\nAD\n\nDisputing credit card charges, for example, is often considered enough to warrant blacklisting, even if the dispute isn\u2019t resolved in your favor. Christie Bissias, who sailed on the Norwegian Bliss with her family last year, says she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done anything that warranted getting her name on the cruise line\u2019s \u201cdo not sail\u201d list. After a less-than-satisfactory cruise \u2014 her chief complaint was that the company failed to provide her and her family with connecting rooms \u2014 she complained to Norwegian Cruise Line.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was never aggressive, abusive or ugly,\u201d says Bissias, who works for a technology company in Houston.\n\nNCL offered her $3,000 in future cruise credits by way of apology, but she said she preferred a refund. When the cruise line didn\u2019t offer one, she disputed her credit card charges. After that, NCL told her she was on its \u201cdo not sail\u201d list. The company would not comment on her case, but when Bissias appealed her blacklisting, NCL allowed her to return. \u201cThey said there was a system error that caused all of this confusion,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nWith car companies, normally, it takes a serious offense to land on the \u201cdo not rent\u201d list \u2014 an offense like the one Niebes Castillo committed. Castillo, a truck driver from Baytown, Tex., left his handgun in his rental car. He caught the mistake almost immediately, turned around and retrieved the weapon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was in a rush,\u201d he says. \u201cI know it was careless and reckless of me.\u201d\n\nBut Hertz added him to the \u201cdo not rent\u201d list, as is the car rental company\u2019s standard practice for customers who leave weapons in their rental vehicles.\n\nInterestingly, car rental companies might blacklist you for lesser infractions. I just had a case from Jacob Danesh, an e-commerce worker from Pikesville, Md., who says Hertz blacklisted him because he used a discount code for which he didn\u2019t qualify.\n\nAD\n\nAnother bannable crime: disputing damage charges on a rental car, as Carol Amitin discovered. She\u2019d rented a car in Baltimore, parked it on her street and then returned it. The car rental company, Enterprise, claimed she damaged the vehicle and billed her. She disputed the credit card charges and won.\n\nThen Amitin, a retired nurse from Baltimore, tried to rent another car from Enterprise and discovered that she\u2019d actually lost \u2014 she couldn\u2019t rent a car.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was put on a \u2018do not rent\u2019 list for Enterprise, which also included their other car rental companies, Alamo and National,\u201d she told me. She had no idea what had happened until she tried to rent another car. \u201cI was informed by the counter personnel that I was on the list and nothing could be done about it, even though I had confirmed reservations in each case,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for customers to draw up blacklists of their own. That\u2019s what Laermer, the banned Delta passenger, did. After he appealed his blacklisting, Delta allowed him to return. Laermer took one final flight, which he had already booked, and then took his business elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI fly JetBlue now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re better.\u201d\n\nOf course, companies have every right to choose which travelers they do business with, as long as it\u2019s legal. But taken together, the cases I\u2019ve received in the past few years present a troubling picture.\n\nMost people know they can get banned for striking a crew member or damaging a rental car. And it\u2019s fairly common knowledge that the government has a No Fly List, which is part of the Terrorist Screening Database. But the latest cases suggest that simple misunderstandings or forgetfulness could lead to you being blacklisted, too.\n\nRead more from Travel:\n\nRead past Navigator columns here\n\nAD", "description": "Some reasons are not at all what you might expect.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c1uhn1cKF81JYISuTlljJ5dkic4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DU6RY3HELQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
