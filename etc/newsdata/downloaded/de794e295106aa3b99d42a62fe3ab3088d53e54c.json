Watch the April Ryan run away from criticism:\n\nAfter listening to as much lying, race-baiting, & fear mongering as I could take from a panel of 7 black leftists called \u201cBeing black under Trump\u201d at @Politicon today, I called out @AprilDRyan for the liar she is & harm she & @CNN have caused.\n\nSTORY:https://t.co/nGEWDSMcF6 pic.twitter.com/4MG6rzJtQo \u2014 Brandon Straka (@BrandonStraka) October 28, 2019\n\nStraka is the founder of the WalkAway movement for former Democrats who are walking away from the party that has done nothing for them. Straka has been sponsoring town halls across the country featuring LGBT, Hispanic, and black minorities who feel abandoned by Democrats and embraced by Trump. Former Democrat voters have uploaded their WalkAway videos to Straka's YouTube page by the thousands.\n\nThe thing that Democrats have always been better at than Republicans is public protest and organizing. It's good to have someone like Straka fighting the good fight because he's effective at getting media attention and attracting young people to his movement. If Republican lawmakers can't go anywhere without being confronted by protesters, then Democrat lawmakers and their enablers in the media should have a similar experience. Maybe then everyone could go back to being civil again.\n\nMegan Fox is the author of \u201cBelieve Evidence; The Death of Due Process from Salome to #MeToo.\u201d Follow on Twitter @MeganFoxWriter", "description": "WalkAway founder Brandon Straka confronted CNN's April Ryan on the issues of race and President Donald Trump. \"You're the biggest liar in this room,\" he declared.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/10/1d88e5c0-f939-4f7d-b920-67083f3f9c85.sized-770x415xt.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
