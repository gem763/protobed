(Justin Tang/Canadian Press)\n\nThat's a significant increase, according to Brownridge.\n\n\"All the political parties have indicated that they see the importance of having women at the table,\" she said.\n\nStill, there are nearly 30 ridings across Canada where there are no women running for a major political party, according to Equal Voice.\n\nAmong the major national parties, the NDP has the most female candidates nominated, with 165, while the Greens have 156, the Liberals 133 and the Conservatives 107.\n\nThere are 55 women running under the PPC banner, and 35 for the Bloc.\n\nElection signs line a railing along Bank Street in Ottawa Centre. (Menaka Raman-Wilms/CBC)\n\n30% within reach\n\nIn the last federal election, 88 women were elected, occupying about 26 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons.\n\nThat's short of the 30 per cent that's generally considered the critical mass of women required to affect policy decisions, according to Brownridge.\n\nIn order to reach that threshold, Canadians would have to elect 102 women this fall.\n\n\"We have a huge opportunity this election to hit that number,\" Brownridge said. \"Given the increase in the number of women that have actually been nominated for the 2019 election, this is absolutely doable.\"", "description": "Two Ottawa ridings are among only a handful in the country where women have been nominated by\u00a0all four major national political parties in the upcoming federal election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5304742.1569958944!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-ottawa-centre-candidates-debate.JPG"}
