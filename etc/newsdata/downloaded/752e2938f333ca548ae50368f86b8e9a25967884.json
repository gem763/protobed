(NDLS)\n\nPerhaps the mostly bearish Wall Street analysts covering Noodles & Co. should give both a try while re-reading the financials. Noodles & Co. is fresh off posting its fifth straight quarter of same-store sales growth in the second quarter, delivering an impressive 4.8% increase. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 20.5%.\n\nThe performance is no minor achievement for Noodles & Co. for a host of reasons.\n\nFirst, the fast-food industry continues to be dominated by burger chains Shake Shack (SHAK) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) and fried chicken sandwich sellers such as Popeyes and Wendy\u2019s. These popular chains are churning out more portable food options \u2014 some healthier plant-based varieties \u2014 at attractive price points. Meanwhile, they are getting these products to consumers increasingly through digital ordering platforms.\n\nSecondarily, there is still a stigma among carb-cutting consumers about pasta. The plant-based burgers at Burger King are pretty fatty and salty, too, but consumers remain hesitant of eating pasta for fear of weight gain.\n\nThat stigma has weighed on Noodles & Co., CEO David Boennighausen said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\n\u2018Disconnect on Wall Street\u2019\n\nAnd last but not least, Noodles & Co. has been through considerable operational changes since it debuted as a hot initial public offering back in June 2013. Underperforming restaurants have been closed, new store growth slowed down and new executives have sought to re-energize the brand.\n\n\u201cThere is a disconnect on Wall Street,\u201d said Boennighausen, who has been with the company since 2004 and CEO since June 2017, when asked about the company\u2019s recent performance and its stock. At $5.82 a share, Noodles & Co.\u2019s stock is light years away from its record highs near $40 around its market debut.\n\nBut with a more profitable mix of stores, a more diversified menu with healthier options and a planned new store expansion starting in 2021 (5% unit growth in 2021 and 7% thereafter, Boennighausen says), Noodles & Co. appears worthy of a second look by Wall Street.\n\nAt the very least, the new menu is worth a try.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
