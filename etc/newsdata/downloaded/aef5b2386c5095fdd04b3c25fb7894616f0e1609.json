And this is only going to get worse.\n\nBefore the vote on the Prime Minister\u2019s deal, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, a man whose manner is intimidating even when he\u2019s trying to be convivial, rang round every Labour MP deemed to be a waverer.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, disgusted at how Mr Corbyn (above) has allowed antisemitism to infect the party, I\u2019ve already decided to resign as a Labour MP. Mr McDonnell would have been wasting his breath and he knew it\n\nExcept me. He and his comrades knew the reception they would get.\n\nI don\u2019t give in to bullying. And I don\u2019t go back on promises to the voters who put me in Parliament either. I\u2019ve consistently defied the party whip and voted to deliver Brexit.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, disgusted at how Mr Corbyn has allowed antisemitism to infect the party, I\u2019ve already decided to resign as a Labour MP.\n\nMr McDonnell would have been wasting his breath and he knew it.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Commons on Saturday was tense and raw. Outside it was more fevered still. I went out on several occasions to do TV interviews on College Green, and it felt like being caught up in a frenzied football crowd\n\nInstead, the whips were focusing on anyone with weaknesses they could exploit. The threat of deselection was being used bluntly: Jon Lansman, founder of the Corbynista Momentum group, tweeted on Saturday: \u2018Labour MPs cannot and must not vote for it. If they do, the NEC will have no choice but to replace them with a new, socialist Labour candidate at the next election.\u2019\n\nBefore the vote on the Prime Minister\u2019s deal, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, a man whose manner is intimidating even when he\u2019s trying to be convivial, rang round every Labour MP deemed to be a waverer\n\nNot all threats are so crude.\n\nIt\u2019s the job of the whips to know who is hoping for promotion, who owes a favour here or there, even who might crumple at the thought of rumours spreading about their private lives. It\u2019s a dirty, nasty business.\n\nThat\u2019s why plenty of Labour MPs tried to stay well out of the way of Mr McDonnell and his cronies before the vote.\n\nOne tactic was to take refuge in Parliament\u2019s Smoking Room, where tobacco is no longer permitted but a giant screen showed live coverage of the Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe whips can approach people, but they can\u2019t do much else. They don\u2019t like witnesses.\n\nAnother safeguard is to stay in the chamber itself. Phones are not permitted. It\u2019s only when it\u2019s time to vote that the whips can pounce, as people make their way to the division chambers.\n\nThat\u2019s why members who plan on defying the party line usually prefer to pair up with an ally, rather than standing alone.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Commons on Saturday was tense and raw. Outside it was more fevered still. I went out on several occasions to do TV interviews on College Green, and it felt like being caught up in a frenzied football crowd.\n\nI don\u2019t give in to bullying. And I don\u2019t go back on promises to the voters who put me in Parliament either. I\u2019ve consistently defied the party whip and voted to deliver Brexit. John Mann is pictured outside Parliament on Saturday\n\nThe aggression was fed by Momentum activists in a co-ordinated campaign of intimidation on social media.\n\nSome of the messages that I and my colleagues have received in recent days are horrific: \u2018Your constituents are mostly racist scumbags.\u2019 \u2018Hope you get a horrible debilitating illness.\u2019\n\nI never get such abuse from my own constituents.\n\nPlenty of people I talk to in Bassetlaw are passionately opposed to Brexit and they make heartfelt appeals to sway my views. But they are never offensive.\n\nFor all their bullying, I\u2019m still not convinced that the hyper-aggressive strategy of Mr McDonnell, Mr Lansman and co will be successful. They acted too soon. There was no need to wheel out their biggest guns.\n\nIn the end, the amendment forestalling Mr Johnson\u2019s deal was defeated by 16 votes. That\u2019s a sizeable margin. If they had thought about it, it would have been tactically wiser to hold back the most ferocious threats for later battles.\n\nNow, it is probable that the bill will get its second and third readings this week and next, possibly starting today.\n\nThis is the vote that the electorate will remember, the one where MPs will finally have to declare whether they are prepared to honour the referendum result \u2013 or not.\n\nAnd the Labour whips have already played their strongest cards. They can and will repeat their threats, but their blackmailing tactics will be losing their power.\n\nCall me an optimist. But, perhaps, when the vote matters most, those dark arts will be on the wane.", "description": "JOHN MANN: Plenty of people I talk to in Bassetlaw are passionately opposed to Brexit and they make heartfelt appeals to sway my views.
