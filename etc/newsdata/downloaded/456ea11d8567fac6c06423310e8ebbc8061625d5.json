The European Council summit will also decide whether to extend Article 50, which would prevent the UK from crashing out on 31 October without a deal.\n\nMr Johnson has publicly said he will not seek an extension to the Brexit deadline, though court documents suggest he has privately promised to do so to comply with a law laid down by parliament. The UK is set to leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of October if no extension is secured, or the UK does not revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit.\n\nUnder the British plan, Northern Ireland would stay aligned with the EU single market regulations for goods, but stay in the UK customs zone.\n\nThe result would be customs checks on products moving between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and regulatory checks on products moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe UK government says the checks could be done away from the border, though has provided little detail on how \u2013 with critics warning the sites would be customs centres in all but name.\n\nThe Northern Ireland assembly and executive would also have to vote to keep the plan going every four years, effectively constituting a veto.\n\nCritics of the UK government proposals, including most business groups and parties in Northern Ireland itself, are concerned that the reintroduction of a hard border would make infrastructure a target for dissident Republicans and disrupt the all-Ireland economy.\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Angela Merkel personally rejected Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals in a\u00a0phone call between the two leaders on Tuesday, effectively burying the plan.
