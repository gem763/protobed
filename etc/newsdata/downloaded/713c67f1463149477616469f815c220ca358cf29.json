(AP) - Andy Dalton fondly recalls the warm welcome he received a little over a year ago, when the Bengals traveled to Buffalo for a preseason game.\n\nThe Cincinnati quarterback drew several ovations after winning over Bills fans\u2019 hearts for his last-minute touchdown to beat Baltimore in the 2017 season finale. The Ravens\u2019 31-27 loss propelled Buffalo into the postseason and snapped the team\u2019s 17-year playoff drought.\n\nDalton knows better than to listen for any cheers in facing the Bills (2-0) in Buffalo\u2019s home opener Sunday.\n\n\u201cHa, ha, no,\u201d Dalton said with a healthy chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting the same kind of ovation I got last time.\u201d\n\nBills defensive end Jerry Hughes has made a point of personally informing Dalton that won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt was such a big moment in our franchise\u2019s history and everything the fans did for him, which is really cool,\u201d Hughes said, recalling watching Dalton hit Tyler Boyd for a 49-yard touchdown pass to convert a fourth-and-12 with 49 seconds left against Baltimore. \u201cBut we understand, and I tell him this every time I see him back in Texas, when we get on the football field, it\u2019s go-time.\u201d\n\nAnd Hughes is speaking as Dalton\u2019s long-time friend, after the two grew up in Houston and were college teammates at TCU.\n\nBuffalo is on a roll in opening the season with two road wins, both at the Meadowlands, and in position to enjoy its first 3-0 start since 2011.\n\nThe Bills defense has allowed just 22 points - not including an interception returned for a touchdown and safety in a 17-16 season-opening win against the Jets.\n\nAnd their new-look offense under second-year quarterback Josh Allen is finding its rhythm after engineering four 70-plus-yard touchdown drives in a 28-14 win over the Giants last weekend.\n\nThe Bengals (0-2) are still trying to find their identity under rookie coach Zac Taylor.\n\nAfter a tightly contested 21-20 season-opening loss at Seattle, Cincinnati unraveled in giving up 572 yards - the fifth-most in franchise history - in a 41-17 loss to San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThe loss is not something we\u2019re going to run from,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe got blown out at home. We could say it was frustrating, but we will not allow our guys to hang their heads.\u201d\n\nRUNNING NOWHERE\n\nThough Dalton leads the NFL with 61 completions and is second with 729 yards passing, the Bengals\u2019 running attack has stalled.\n\nAn injury depleted offensive line has been the biggest issue. Rookie left tackle Jonah Williams tore a labrum in offseason workouts. Backup Cordy Glenn - a former Bill - missed the first two games with a concussion. And third-string tackle Andre Smith hurt his groin against the 49ers but is expected back this week. Cincinnati is last in the league with 59 yards on 33 carries through two games.\n\nRunning back Joe Mixon resorted to posting a message on Twitter, apologizing to his fans.\n\n\u201cI promise I will get it right and we will be better,\u201d wrote Mixon, averaging 1.8 yards per carry.\n\n0-NO\n\nTaylor was hired from the Rams to replace Marvin Lewis, who was fired after failing to win a playoff game in 16 seasons. The 0-2 start is ominous. It\u2019s the 17th time in franchise history that the Bengals have opened 0-2, and have never managed a winning record after such a start.\n\n\u201cWe win this week, and the feeling in this building is a lot different,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nTAP THE BRAKES\n\nThe Bills know better than to take a 2-0 start for granted. After starting 3-0 and eventually getting to 5-2 in 2011, Buffalo unraveled in closing the season 6-10. It was no different in 2008, when Buffalo opened 4-0 and finished 7-9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking at one game right now, honestly,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said, when reminded Buffalo plays five of its next six at home.\n\nKROFT SIGHTING\n\nBuffalo tight end Tyler Kroft is in position to make his season debut and against his former team. The Bills offseason free-agent addition has practiced the past three weeks after missing the entire offseason with a broken right foot.\n\n\u201cAnother added threat that you\u2019re going to have to worry about in the passing game,\u201d Allen said of Kroft, who spent his first four seasons in Cincinnati.\n\nDONATIONS\n\nAside from applause, Dalton\u2019s win over Baltimore led to Bills fans donating more than $450,000 to the quarterback\u2019s charitable foundation. He returned a portion of it back with a donation to Buffalo\u2019s Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cIt shows the game\u2019s bigger than just football,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nAnother $100,000 was donated to Boyd\u2019s cause of choice, which went to funding a youth sports league in his hometown of Clairton, Pennsylvania.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Kay in Cincinnati, Ohio, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andy Dalton fondly recalls the warm welcome he received a little over a year ago, when the Bengals traveled to Buffalo for a preseason game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/bengals_bills_preview_football_42096_c0-253-2563-1747_s1770x1032.jpg?e996f1fceab5e4e438c359dbd2764fd0fc22c434", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
