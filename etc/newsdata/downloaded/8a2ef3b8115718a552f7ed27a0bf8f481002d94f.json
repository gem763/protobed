You should try to go to bed an hour earlier if possible.\n\n\"A lot of people drink a tea after dinner, that might be okay if you're eating at six but if you're having it later you might have to cut back.\n\n\"You need to start thinking about it in advance, you can start giving yourself 15 minutes extra every night to get used to it.\n\n\"Our bodies have very integral body clocks. When this changes it can affect your body and it can be difficult to get back into the routine of sleep again.\"\n\n(Image: iStockphoto)\n\nIn order to keep the routine as set as possible, Dr Sara suggests trying to go to bed and getting up at the same time every day, even at the weekends.\n\nAs well as feeling tired, a lack of sleep have also affect us both physically and mentally.\n\nEvery Mind Matters, which is backed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , is looking at sleep and its importance to our mental well-being.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nTips for dropping off if you have trouble sleeping\n\nProfessor Colin Espie, Professor of Sleep Medicine at the University of Oxford, has shared his top tips for getting to sleep easier.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Dr\u00a0Sara\u00a0Kayat explains why sleep is so important and what you can do this weekend to adjust to the clocks going back", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11578077.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_woman-in-bed-late-night-trying-to-sleep-suffering-insomnia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
