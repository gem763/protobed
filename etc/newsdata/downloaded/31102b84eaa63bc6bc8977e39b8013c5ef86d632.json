Britain\u2019s dominant service sector unexpectedly rebounded into positive territory in July after a shock dip into negative the month before. That mini expansion looks to have underpinned gains in other smaller components, like construction and factory output; the latter swung 0.3% higher when a deepening slowdown equating to a 0.3% fall on the month was forecast.\n\nTo be sure, the monthly resilience is out of step with the year\u2019s deteriorating service sector trend. The downturn has been accompanied with stagnation in the usually robust housing market and the first signs of a change of sentiment among equally redoubtable UK consumers, after retail sales disappointed. Recent BOE data showed households beginning to worry about potentially damaging price rises, particularly in light of multi-year lows in consumer savings rates since the 2016 Brexit vote. Pressure looks to have resumed on businesses too, according to the more up-to-date PMI readings out last week.\n\nGradual softening is likely to limit monetary policymakers' choices in months to come regardless of Brexit. After some of his most optimistic comments on the likely post-Brexit period for months, BOE governor Mark Carney concluded that growth remains \u201cSlightly positive, but close to zero.\u201d That suggests another cap for the currency that's not coherent with the latest price action.\n\nChart thoughts\n\nCable has pulled further away from though is unlikely to have escaped the magnetic pull of last week\u2019s around-three-year lows. Buyers would now ordinarily expect the grind through the region across roughly $1.22-$1.23 to have laid the groundwork for much needed protection in the days ahead.\n\nTwo hourly tags towards the lower boundary of the range last Thursday\u2014$1.2208 and $1.2212\u2014corroborate it as \u2018live\u2019. With a 26th July \u2018failure low\u2019 at $1.23765 invalidated as consolidates Monday\u2019s resumed up leg, it\u2019s left to last week\u2019s $1.2354 high to guard the $1.22/23 zone. For sellers, the chance that renewed weakness could take the rate down and out of the lower side of the zone will be tempting. If seen, the probabilities that follow-through could take cable back toward to high $1.20s at least, would rise.\n\n\u2013 hourly\n\nGBP/USD Hourly\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
