Volume is typically light during the dog days of summer and many market participants delay making big moves until after they return to work in September.\n\nAugust 2019 saw some thin trading at times but it was extremely volatile. There were numerous big swings as market players debated and reacted to news about a trade deal with China, the potential for an economic recession and whether aggressive easing by the Fed and central banks around the world can keep the 10 year long bull market running higher.\n\nThe big picture debate is one of the most intense in years and market players are feeling increasingly uncertain. Predictions of an economic recession are the highest level on records, 10-year bonds are hitting their lowest yields on record and precious metals are attracting the most attention in a long time.\n\nThe indices have been in a wide trading range for most of the month and have teased market players with potential breaks in both directions.\n\nIt isn't surprising that market pundits are loudly making dramatic predictions about what is going to happen next.\n\nThis is a very intriguing set up as we head into the seasonally worst month of the year.\n\nThere are a couple of things that favor the bulls. The first is that there is already quite a bit of bearish sentiment. It doesn't take much good news to trigger a sharp rally and the potential for progress on China trade seems to be a catalyst several times a week. Although many folks are skeptical that a deal will come this year, it is easy to be caught being too negative.\n\nThe main development that traders have to consider is whether a dovish Fed can keep the market running. Bond yields have been hitting record low levels and that has been more negative than positive. The bears have long anticipated that it would be an ineffectual Fed that finally killed the bulls but they have been wrong for years.\n\nThe good news is that there should be some volatility and that will lead to some opportunities for trading. I avoid trying to make predictions about what is going to happen but I am optimistic that we can find some good action to trade\n\nEnjoy the Labor Day weekend. I will see you on Tuesday.", "description": "The big picture debate is one of the most intense in years and market players are feeling increasingly uncertain.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "An Unusually Volatile August Sets The Stage For September Drama", "The Big Picture Debate Is One Of The Most Intense In Years", "Market Players Are Feeling Increasingly Uncertain.", "Jim Collins", "Eric Jhonsa", "Bruce Kamich", "Paul Price", "Kevin Curran"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a1df0bc8-7ccd-11e9-a5aa-65026c8c2ea8.png"}
