The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has concurrently assigned QDWC's proposed US-dollar senior unsecured bonds a 'BBB-(EXP)' expected rating. The proposed bonds will be issued by QDWC's wholly owned subsidiary, Xi Hai An 2019 Limited, and will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by QDWC and rank pari passu with QDWC's other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Bond proceeds will be used for financing domestic construction projects and refinancing existing offshore indebtedness. Key Rating Drivers 'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: QDWC is wholly owned by the Qingdao municipal government via the Qingdao State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Qingdao municipal government, via Qingdao SASAC, has direct control and oversight of the company's board and monitors its strategic planning and finances. All major corporate events, including annual budgets, investments and MA, require government approval. 'Strong' Support Track Record and Expectations: The attribute reflects the government's record of financial support. Qingdao municipality has historically provided financial and policy support. All of QDWC's capital has been seeded by the government, while Qingdao municipality provides the company with financial subsidies from time to time. Fitch also factors in expectations of extraordinary support in light of QDWC's policy role. Fitch believes that there will be more positive policies with the setup of Shandong Free Trade Zone in 2019, covering part of West Coast New Area. 'Moderate' Socio-Political Implication of Default: Fitch believes a default of QDWC may have a 'Moderate' social-political effect in light of the company's important policy role in the urban development of West Coast New Area, which has driven Qingdao's strong gross regional product growth. QDWC has a dominant position within the new area in infrastructure construction. Hence, its default could disrupt Qingdao's economy, although Fitch acknowledges that economic development is the government's key priority, but not a mandatory requirement. 'Moderate' Financial Implication of Default: Fitch regards QDWC as an important government-related entity (GRE) in light of its functional status. However, Qingdao municipality has more than one urban developer and QDWC has relatively smaller asset and debt amounts. If QDWC was unable to carry out its functions, other GREs could step in to prevent a halt of key services. This is the main constraint against QDWC having a 'Stronger' attribute assessment. 'b' Standalone Credit Profile: Fitch assesses QDWC's revenue defensibility as 'Midrange' because overall demand is likely to exhibit lower volatility than China's general economic activity. Fitch assesses QDWC's operating risk as 'Midrange' based on its predictable cost structure and assesses its financial profile as 'Weaker' in consideration of its high leverage and large debt-funded capital expenditure. Net leverage, measured by net debt/EBITDA, was 28x at end-2018 and Fitch expected it to remain elevated in the next few years. Derivation Summary Fitch assesses QDWC under its GRE Rating Criteria, reflecting Qingdao municipality's ultimate ownership and oversight over the company, a record of financial support and the company's functional role in Qingdao's development. These factors indicate a strong incentive by the sponsor to provide extraordinary support to QDWC, if needed. QDWC's IDR was derived from the four factors under Fitch's GRE Rating Criteria and the Standalone Credit Profile of 'b' under our Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Rating Criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings on QDWC could change if Fitch revises its perception of Qingdao municipality's ability to provide subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies and regulations. An increased incentive for Qingdao municipality to provide support to QDWC, including stronger socio-political and financial implications of default or a stronger support track record and expectations, may trigger positive rating action. The rating may be downgraded if there is a significant weakening in the socio-political and financial implications of default, a weaker support track record and expectations from the government, or a dilution in the government's shareholding. Rating action on QDWC would lead to similar action on the proposed US-dollar bonds.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
