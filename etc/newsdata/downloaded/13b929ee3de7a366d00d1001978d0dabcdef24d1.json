(AP) - In his mind\u2019s eye, Daniel Menihan Jr. sees a time when backyard vegetable gardens dot the Mashantucket Pequot reservation, their yields nourishing healthy tribal families.\n\nBy then, he figures, the Mashantuckets\u2019 own commercial growing operation could be regularly supplying produce to Foxwoods Resort Casino restaurants.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty picture. And it\u2019s not far-fetched.\n\nTwo years into a four-year collaboration with the University of Connecticut\u2019s College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources, tribal members led by Menihan, a tribal councilor, have grown sweet corn and heirloom tomatoes on tribe-owned property here on Swantown Hill, near Foxwoods\u2019 Lake of Isles golf courses.\n\nThey\u2019re about to harvest honey and will soon plant lettuce.\n\nFunded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Federally Recognized Tribes Extension Program, the undertaking seeks to improve food security among the Mashantuckets; engage tribal youth; boost the economic viability of the 1,100-member tribe\u2019s agricultural enterprises and educate tribal members about nutrition and health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great investment from the health standpoint,\u201d said Menihan, who likes to emphasize that aspect of the program. \u201cWe bring the kids up here and let them pick stuff and take it home. They light up.\u201d\n\nMenihan, joined by Shuresh Ghimire, a UConn Extension educator who helped the tribe secure the federal grant, led a recent tour of the Swantown Hill property. Part of a 187-acre parcel known as the Ackerman Farm, it was purchased by the tribe about 15 years ago. Participants in the program have tilled a cornfield and a children\u2019s garden and constructed two side-by-side high tunnels - greenhouse-like structures that facilitate growing in a semi-controlled environment.\n\nThe high tunnels are not heated, and the plants grown inside them are rooted in the ground. In greenhouses, plants typically are grown in containers.\n\nWith Ghimire guiding the process, the tribe grew tomatoes in one of the high tunnels during the growing season that recently concluded. Some of the harvest was sold at a stand on the reservation to tribal members, employees and the community. The plan is to start selling tomatoes to Foxwoods in 2020.\n\nThe $280,000 federal grant - $70,000 a year for four years - and additional funding from the Indian Land Tenure Foundation, a nonprofit organization, has so far provided for soil-testing, the high tunnels, hook-ups for water and electricity, development of a business plan and the purchase of such equipment as cold storage, a disc harrow, a rototiller and a mulch layer.\n\nA good chunk of the grant money goes to pay two youthful tribal members who are being trained in vegetable-growing, knowledge they will impart to tribal youth. Some of the training takes place in a classroom.\n\nIn a sign of its commitment to the program, the tribe also has created two full-time positions to support the growing efforts, Menihan said.\n\nThe program has helped foster a relationship between the tribe and UConn Extension, an outreach service that maintains offices around the state, including one in Norwich, about 10 miles from the tribe\u2019s reservation. Despite the proximity, there had been little interaction between the two.\n\n\u201cThey rarely attended our events; we knew little about them,\u201d Ghimire said. \u201cWe sat down together and talked about the need for this grant. We knew we could help them to grow their own food and help with health and nutrition within their cultural ways.\u201d\n\nMenihan said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, played a key role in making it happen.\n\nGrowing vegetables was hardly foreign to the historically agrarian tribe, which raised the \u201cthree sisters\u201d - corn, beans and squash - as well as tobacco centuries ago. After the tribe reorganized in the 1970s and before it gained the federal recognition that allowed it to pursue gaming in the 1980s, members raised hogs, harvested maple syrup and grew hydroponic lettuce.\n\nMore recently, the tribe\u2019s Sugar Shack maple syrup business started selling syrup at Foxwoods in 2016 and currently provides it to the casino\u2019s Cedars Steaks & Oyster and VUE 24 restaurants. The syrup also is available at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center and at the tribe\u2019s Pequot Outpost convenience store.\n\nGhimire said federal officials monitoring the tribe\u2019s progress have been impressed. About 40 percent of the benchmarks for the four-year program were achieved in the first year, according to Menihan.\n\nStill ahead are the establishment of a 4-H Club for tribal youth and further educational outreach to tribal members in need of information about nutrition and diabetes, a disease endemic in Indian Country. Healthier eating, including less consumption of fast food, is a goal tribal populations embrace.\n\nMenihan wants to work on establishing a Mashantucket Pequot Department of Agriculture as a standalone division of tribal government. He said the idea has the support of the tribal council and tribal membership.\n\n\u201cYou want to do right first,\u201d he said of the health aspect of the growing program. \u201cThat\u2019s the real priority.\u201d\n\nHence his goal of seeing, within 10 years, \u201cvegetables growing in everybody\u2019s backyards.\u201d\n\nHe readily acknowledged that the economics are important, too. Before the federal grant money runs out in 2021, the Mashantuckets\u2019 commercial farming operation might have to be able to sustain itself as well as the tribe.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2n5OkkX\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Day, http://www.theday.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In his mind's eye, Daniel Menihan Jr. sees a time when backyard vegetable gardens dot the Mashantucket Pequot reservation, their yields nourishing healthy tribal families.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Hallenbeck"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
