Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) also missed estimates at $1.07 in EPS vs. $1.14 expected in the first report after naming Charles Scharf as its new CEO. In a clear example of negative impact of falling interest rates, the consumer-focused bank reported worse-than-anticipated Net Interest Income despite 2% growth in total loans.\n\nin the first report after naming Charles Scharf as its new CEO. In a clear example of negative impact of falling interest rates, the consumer-focused bank reported worse-than-anticipated Net Interest Income despite 2% growth in total loans.

Citigroup (NYSE: ) narrowly outperformed analysts\u2019 expectations, with $1.97 in EPS vs. $19.5 eyed. Solid trading revenue figures helped the firm beat headline revenue expectations as well.\n\nFor traders anticipating the worst, this morning\u2019s bank earnings onslaught was not as bad as feared. At the open, major indices are edging higher and the big banks are trading roughly in line with their earnings results:\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is trading down more than -3%.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE: ) is dipping less than -1%\n\n(NYSE: ) is dipping less than -1% JP Morgan (JPM) is tacking on nearly 2%.\n\nCitigroup (NYSE: ) is essentially flat.\n\nBank Performance\n\nLooking ahead, the Federal Reserve appears likely to cut interest rates further this quarter, with futures traders pricing in an 80% of at least one interest rate cut by the end of the year and about a 25% probability of two cuts. If interest rates more broadly continue to trend lower, Wells Fargo\u2019s large mortgage business could be a casuality.\n\nMarket will also play a key role in the banks\u2019 trading revenue; with geopolitical tensions on the rise, Brexit looming, and lingering concerns about the state of play between the US and China, a spike in volatility could benefit banks in Q4.\n\nIn addition to falling interest rates and market volatility, one key factor to watch moving forward will be buybacks. According to Barclays (LON: ), large banks have reduced their outstanding shares by 2% over the last quarter, and after the Fed approved a record $173B in buybacks and dividends for the banks, this may be just the tip of the proverbial buyback iceberg. Citigroup (NYSE: ) alone reduced its share count by 11% over the past year!\n\nWhile the broader economy may prefer banks to grow revenues through more traditional means, big banks\u2019 investors will no doubt benefit from the firms returning capital to their shareholders.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays PLC.
