Yet, this is an area infamous for muggings, so it;s important to be wary of where you walk after dark.\n\nFood and drinks\n\nGo to the relatively unassuming, eccentrically decorated Ferdinandos for pizza. This is real Italian pizza made with passion.\n\nTrenchtown might need a slight revamp, but the food is good and the prices are legit. Get a R60 pizza and R20 double gin and tonic on Wednesdays. They also now have comedy nights on Wednesdays - so go take in some laughs!\n\nYou'll recognise Kind Regards by its pink neon sign. Can't miss it. On Station Road, it's brand new and has an exciting menu of Portuguese and Indian dishes. Try the Buttermilk Burger!\n\nREAD: The world's best cities to live in - and where Cape Town, Durban and Jo'burg rank\n\nAnother excellent spot on Lower Main Road is Timbuktu Cafe for Ethiopian food. The atmosphere is very laid-back, so don't expect a hustle.\n\nTIP: It doesn't have a liquor license so feel free to BYOB.\n\nREAD: Quick Guide to France: Say Bonjour to your next escape\n\nGrab a delicious coffee by Saint James Caf\u00e9, also situated on Station Road. It really has that just-around-the-corner neighbourhood coffee shop feel.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out\n\nGo shop vintage at Better Half Vintage. Seriously, the best finds if you're a fashion lover. Or stop in at Pereira Vintage for handpicked items from eras past.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the year there is a range of festivals hosted by this 'hood. Be sure to check out Streettopia, a free community festivals with lots of street performances, food vendors and art.\n\nGo for a run, a walk with the dog or just meander by Liesbeek River.
