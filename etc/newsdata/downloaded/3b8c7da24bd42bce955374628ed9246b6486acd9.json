He said, \u201cOh you love musicals, don\u2019t you? Have you seen the Lion King?\u201d\n\n\u2018I said I\u2019d never seen it and he said, \u201cNeither have I, let\u2019s go to say thank you\u201d.\n\n\u2018Nothing romantic, obviously. He\u2019s like, 49, which is the same age as my mum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nothing romantic but he\u2019s a nice guy.\u2019\n\nTo be fair, Toby is only 48, so maybe not quite the same age as your mum.\n\nAmy became a household name following her stint in the villa, with her exit bringing the entire country to tears.\n\nAnd the former air hostess explained that it\u2019s a lot harder to know exactly who to trust now she\u2019s back home.\n\nDiscussing her love life, she continued: \u2018I met a guy in Dubai actually and he was like, \u201cOh, yeah, I didn\u2019t watch Love Island.\u201d [I thought] Okay, brilliant.\n\nAmy has found the dating world tough since returning home from Love Island (Picture: In The Style)\n\n\u2018My best friend said to him, \u201cOh so you didn\u2019t watch it then?\u201d and he started laughing, saying: \u201cI watched every episode but I\u2019m not gonna tell her that\u201d.\u2019\n\nNot ideal.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been out on a couple of dates with people, but at the moment I\u2019m so busy,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018I thought going on Love Island was going to solve all my problems with dating, because when I was an air hostess, I couldn\u2019t meet people that easily.\n\n\u2018I thought it was going to make my life easier being around, but I\u2019m never around anyway!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Hart\u2019s In The Style Power Edit collection is available now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
