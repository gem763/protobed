Your body grows bigger. You can jump higher. You can feel better in school. You can watch more movies with me and understand them.\u2019 I let them know the effects of what eating good food means. And they\u2019re pretty willing to get through it.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to Halloween candy, however, she engages in a bit of trickery.\n\n\u201cThis is one place where we are a bit dishonest in our parenting, but if they ever asked, I promise I would tell them the truth,\u201d said Bell. \u201cWhen they\u2019re trick-or-treating, we let them eat a couple of pieces of candy, and then when we come home, they put their pillowcases on the washing machine where they aren\u2019t readily available.\u201d\n\nThe following morning, Bell goes through all the candy and removes half of it. But she has a strategy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly because I don\u2019t want some things in there. Candies that I feel are very bad for them, I\u2019ll switch them with better candies \u2015 like ones with sugar as opposed to high-fructose corn syrup,\u201d she explained, noting that she lets the girls eat one or two pieces of candy a day for the next couple of weeks.\n\nBell emphasized that if her daughters ever asked about their candy, she would be honest.\n\n\u201cI make little changes, and they never know the difference. So I\u2019m fine being dishonest about that. But if they asked, I\u2019d say, \u2018I care about your body and these are better for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough Bell strives to eat a healthy diet, she said she and her husband, Dax Shepard, do like to treat themselves to some of the candy removed from their daughters\u2019 trick-or-treating haul.\n\n\u201cAfter they go to bed, we eat a few pieces for sure. Hell yeah,\u201d she said.\n\nOther ways the actors try to encourage their children to eat healthy food is by preparing fun and inventive meals. \u201cI always talk about how colorful food should be, that you should have a rainbow on the plate,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAnd making them delicious of course. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Every once in a while I\u2019ll grind some spinach into a smoothie. But there\u2019s usually no trickery going on. We can say, \u2018That tastes delicious, and it\u2019s also good for you!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen the girls are less on board, Bell said they try another method they learned from their preschool: asking, \u201cHow many minutes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a child wants a toy or swing, they can ask the other child, \u2018How many minutes for the swing?\u2019 So one child knows there\u2019s a foreseeable end, and one child knows there\u2019s a foreseeable future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo at dinner we can ask, \u2018How many minutes until you finish your broccoli?\u2019 And they know they can\u2019t get out of it but can say, \u2018I need five minutes,\u2019 and then at the end of the five minutes, they do it.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The \"Good Place\" star shared how she and Dax Shepard keep their daughters from going overboard.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db212242000006d26506b8b.jpeg?cache=SYTAiN5dDu&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
