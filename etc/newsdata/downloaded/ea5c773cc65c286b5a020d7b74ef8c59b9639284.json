Every other day, we hear stories with marine animals and creatures swallowing plastic materials mistaking it as food. The plastic waste eventually takes up its toll and kills the animal. In another heartbreaking incident, a palm-sized turtle was found dead in Florida with an unbelievable 104 pieces of plastic clogging up its intestines, a report in unilad.co.uk stated.\n\nhttps://www.unilad.co.uk\n\nGumbo Limbo Nature Center, Inc. shared the image along with a heart-wrenching post on their official Facebook page.\n\n\"Not such a happy #TurtleTuesday this week. It's washback season at Gumbo Limbo and weak, tiny turtles are washing up along the coastline needing our help. Unfortunately, not every washback survives. 100% of our washbacks that didn't make it had plastic in their intestinal tracts. This turtle, which would fit in the palm of your hand, had eaten 104 pieces of plastic. This is a sad reminder that we all need to do our part to keep our oceans plastic free\", they had captioned.\n\nThe tiny animal was discovered by the Gumbo Limbo Nature Center, a cooperative project based in Boca Raton, Florida, made up of the City of Boca Raton, the Greater Boca Raton Beach and Park District, Florida Atlantic University and Friends of Gumbo Limbo.\n\nThe organisation was monitoring turtles during what it describes as 'washback season', when turtle hatchlings that made it to the Gulf Stream start to wash back up along the US coast.\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 258 SHARES 405 SHARES\n\nLast year in December, scientists had studied seven species of turtles across the world's oceans, in an effort to determine how much pollution has been affecting them.\n\nDepressingly, the team found microplastics in every single one of the turtles they analysed.\n\nAccording to estimates, there are about 5 trillion pieces of plastic accumulated in our oceans, all thanks to our own thoughtless dumping. All of these break down into tiny microscopic particles called microplastics. These get into the digestive systems of fish and water mammals, and consequently us as well. And at just about 5 millimetres at their largest, they're pretty much impossible to see with the naked eye.", "description": "Our oceans are filled with plastic and we have ourselves to blame for this mess.
