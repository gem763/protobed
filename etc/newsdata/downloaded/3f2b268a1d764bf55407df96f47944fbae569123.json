It is unclear if they knew any of the boys who lived in the home or how they ended up there.\n\nSchoenig's death remains a mystery, but the college has temporarily suspended the fraternity.\n\nThe house was not the fraternity's official headquarters.\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed if the Schoenig and his friends were attending a party at the off-campus property when he died.\n\nPenn State released a statement about his death and about suspending the university, but said nothing of how he died.\n\n'On Saturday, Oct. 19, medical assistance was sought for an individual who was unresponsive, at an off-campus house allegedly occupied by Chi Phi members, on West College Avenue in State College, which is not the fraternity\u2019s official house.\n\n'The individual was pronounced dead at the scene. Penn State offers deepest sympathies to the family and friends of this young man.\n\nSchoenig was with friends at this off-campus Chi Phi frat house near Penn State on Saturday. He died after going into cardiac arrest at around 9.30pm\n\n'State College Police and the University\u2019s Office of Student Conduct are investigating.\n\n'However, Penn State has issued an interim suspension of the Alpha Delta Chapter of Chi Phi fraternity, a member of the Interfraternity Council, until more information is known. The individual was visiting the area and was not a Penn State student.\n\n'The interim suspension means the fraternity loses all privileges as a recognized student organization pending the outcome of the investigations.\n\n'The organization may not participate, attend or organize any functions, activities or events, or participate in University-wide events as an organization,' it said.\n\nSchoenig's friends and family in Erie are now honoring his memory.\n\nHe was a talented ice hockey player who was in his final year of high school.\n\n", "description": "John Jack Schoenig, 17, from Erie, Pennsylvania, died on Saturday after going into cardiac arrest at the Chi Phi house at around 9.30pm.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20082608-0-image-a-12_1571835025087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
