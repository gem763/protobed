The down and distance make for a long shot, but it made sense to take the chance while trailing by three scores.\n\nWhat\u2019s not fine is how they reportedly got there.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDid Browns commit intentional penalty?\n\nThe Browns initially lined up for a punt on fourth-and-11. They got backed up five yards on a false start penalty, seemingly prompting second thoughts for head coach Freddie Kitchens, who sent his offense back on the field for the conversion attempt.\n\nBut according to a pair of reports, Kitchens didn\u2019t have second thoughts after the penalty. He changed his mind prior to the false start.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nCBS\u2019s Tracy Wolfson reported during the game broadcast that Kitchens called for the intentional false start so he could get his punt team off the field. Browns broadcaster Nathan Zegura reported the same.\n\nKitchens reportedly wanted to preserve timeout\n\nCleveland had a timeout remaining. He reportedly preferred the five-yard penalty on an already improbable fourth-down situation than to use that timeout.\n\nFreddie Kitchens reportedly decided that making a long-shot play even longer was better than burning a timeout.
