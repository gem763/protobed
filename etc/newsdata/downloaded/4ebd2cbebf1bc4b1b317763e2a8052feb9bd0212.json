No other sector comes close to the return potential of the sector. Just take a look at the gains for the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI). The ETF and sector benchmark has managed to post average annual returns of nearly 19% over the last decade. That\u2019s pretty insane and underscores the kind of potential that biotech stocks can have.\n\nBut they also come with a ton of risk to get that return. They don\u2019t call them lotto tickets for anything. Many biotech stocks are just one bad trial away from crashing, burning and causing plenty of heartache for their shareholders.\n\nHowever, there are ways to hedge your bets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAside from going into a broad ETF like the XBI, the key is making sure that investors focus on developmental pipelines, partnership and plenty of cash on their balance sheets. Having a drug actually in the marketing stages doesn\u2019t hurt either. It\u2019s here that investors can find success in the sector.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five biotech stocks that have plenty of potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalapagos NV (GLPG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA good way to spot top clinical-stage and early-entry biotech stocks is finding those firms with top-notch partners. And Galapagos NV (NASDAQ:GLPG) couldn\u2019t have picked a better partner than biotech royalty Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Earlier this year, GILD upped its partnership stake in GLPG via a nearly $4 billion payment as well as a $1.1 billion equity stake. All in all, Gilead will now own 22% of Galapagos.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why GILD would want to pony up that kind of cash for the biotech firm. It needs to fill potential revenue holes in its aging pipeline and GLPG has the goods.\n\nGalapagos has one of the richest and largest development pipelines around. The drug company has multiple late-stage programs as well as 25 different drugs in discovery/early trial stages. This includes its potential blockbuster in Filgotinib. This was the first partnership with Gilead and after impressive phase-3 data for the rheumatoid arthritis drug, the duo submitted a marketing application with the FDA earlier this month. Meanwhile, successful initial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis data, as well as beginning trials for new cystic fibrosis medicines, could all bare significant fruit for GLPG.\n\nThat\u2019s an impressive amount of \u201cshots on goal\u201d for a clinical-stage biotech stock. The best part is, based on the rich deal, the speculation is that Galapagos wanted to stay independent rather than receive a full buyout from GILD. This means it can make the full use of that pipeline with future royalty and milestone payments. It also means investors in GLPG stock can as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlueprint Medicines (BPMC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere are a few mega-trends in the world of biotech stocks. Gene therapy is a major one. Another is the concept of small-molecule drugs. Small-molecule drugs are generally more stable than their biologic counterparts and can more commonly be taken as pills as opposed to injections. Though some injected biologics can be taken outside of a healthcare setting (notably Abbvie\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) Humira), many need to be administered by a doctor, nurse or other medical professional. This makes small-molecule drugs better for accessibility and ongoing treatments.\n\nThis focus on small-molecule drugs makes Blueprint Medicines (NASDAQ:BPMC) a potential real winner among the biotech stocks.", "description": "Biotech stocks have to be the ultimate risk and reward equities.
