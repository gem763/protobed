Joni Ernst (R-IA) unveiled her new bill to rein in government agency public relations and advertising spending on mascots, koozies, and fidget spinners Tuesday on Breitbart News Daily.\n\nErnst, the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, told Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow about her new legislation to rein in government agencies\u2019 advertising budget. The bill, known as the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government (SWAG) Act, prohibits the federal government from spending money to create a \u201cmascot\u201d to promote an agency, as well as producing swag such as fidget spinners, koozies, and mascots.\n\n\u201cI am rolling out a new bill in my efforts to hold the federal government more accountable and watch our spending,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIt is called the SWAG Act. It is the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government Act, and what a lot of folks don\u2019t realize is that the federal government spends over $1.4 billion on public relations and advertising campaigns. That is twice the amount that is dedicated to breast cancer research, and while I\u2019m all about the mascots and things like that of course as an Iowa State Cyclone fan and you know what? For the federal government, there\u2019s really no justifications spending a quarter of a million dollars in taxpayer money on mascots and millions more on swag.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what the bill will do is that it will prohibit agencies from purchasing and distributing swag, like coloring books, koozies, fidget spinners, and of course, creating their own mascots,\u201d the Iowa senator added.\n\nThe SWAG Act will also require agencies to disclose spending on public relations and advertising spending.\n\nGovernment agencies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on tote bags and other swag, which includes:\n\n$605,000 for coloring books\n\n$60,000 for key chains\n\n$33,000 for snuggies\n\n$17,000 for koozies\n\n$16,000 for fidget spinners\n\nThe government\u2019s advertising budget does not merely amount to freebies; the State Department spent $630,000 to purchase fake Facebook fans and paid for social media influencers on a two-week trip across the world to promote American values. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spent roughly $10,000 producing zombie apocalypse survival guides.\n\nMarlow noted that the Department of Energy (DOE) spent $5,000 on a mascot called the \u201cGreen Reaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour heart breaks that this is what our country is spending\u201d taxpayers\u2019 money on, Marlow said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the Green Reaper. We don\u2019t need to be spending upwards of $605,000 on coloring books, you know; this is not what we should be spending on as a federal government,\u201d Ernst said.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M.
