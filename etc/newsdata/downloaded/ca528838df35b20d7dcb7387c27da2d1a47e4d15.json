Yet lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate had served themselves a full plate of issues to deal with before the 2020 election campaign takes over.\n\nThe view from the White House was grim. Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, said the impeachment inquiry \u201cdestroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country.\u201d And Trump lashed out at Pelosi Wednesday saying \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment drive centers on the same six committees that already have been looking into Trump\u2019s actions in office and business dealings.\n\n\u201cWhat changes is the tempo and the focus,\u201d said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nThe sprawling House investigations have triggered subpoenas and court cases that could take months to resolve. Pelosi now is being urged by some Democrats to narrow the focus to Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the heart of the current impeachment proceeding. On Wednesday night, NBC News reported that 218 House members -- a majority of the chamber -- supported some sort of impeachment inquiry.\n\nA report from a whistle-blower in the intelligence community about the Trump administration\u2019s actions that was available to some members of Congress Wednesday has since been declassified and is expected to be released Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss information that hasn\u2019t yet been publicly released.\n\nAmid the turmoil and rancor, Democrats still made statements giving cheery assessments of the prospects for making deals to pass legislation or continue negotiations with Republicans and the White House.\n\nPelosi\u2019s approach since Trump took office has been to let House committees pursue investigations of the president while seeking legislative compromises with him on top Democratic priorities including drug pricing and gun control, as well as must-pass items like annual spending bills. Approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal is a high priority for Trump.\n\nWhether his anger subsidies to allow the legislative work to continue remains an open question. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the president\u2019s closest confidantes in Congress, rejected the White House position that impeachment would grind the legislative agenda to a halt.\n\n\u201cI told the president this morning, that is a cop-out, you still got to be president,\u201d Graham told reporters.\n\nTransportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, echoed Graham\u2019s optimism that deals can be struck even in the middle of an investigation of the president.\n\n\u201cRichard Nixon signed a huge infrastructure package when he was under an impeachment inquiry,\u201d he said.\n\nOutreach\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said presidential aides reached out to him Tuesday night to discuss gun legislation.\n\n\u201cAt the same time that Trump is trying to claim that we\u2019re walking away from the legislative process on guns, his team is pulling us back in,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThe big test will be in the coming weeks as White House officials and House Democrats negotiate changes needed to get House approval of the trade accord known as USMCA, the replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nHouse Democrats privately discussed it on Wednesday, and their top negotiator Richard Neal of Massachusetts said progress was being made on revisions that will get it through the House.\n\n\u201cWe are down to a handful of differences,\u201d said Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cMy position is the work of governance has to go on.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s launching of a impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump risks crowding out the legislative agendas of both the White House and Democrats on key items such as a trade pact with Canada and Mexico known as USMCA, drug prices and avoiding a government shutdown.Impeachment", "authors": ["Erik Wasson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WZc.C4_AmTYxBTk4JJH9Kw--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/5d6383340fe5575c97448981c11f5889", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
