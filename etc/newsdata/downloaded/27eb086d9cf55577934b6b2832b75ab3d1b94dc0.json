The opposition Yabloko Party won four seats, and the Fair Russia Party three.\n\nSeveral videos circulating on social media showed some voters openly stuffing ballot boxes with multiple voting slips.\n\nAt least six Russian soldiers in Moscow told Reuters they had been coerced into voting and told to provide photographic evidence that they had cast their ballot to their superiors.\n\nPress-ganging soldiers into voting is a tactic used to boost low turnout in Moscow and is also meant to skew results in favor of pro-Kremlin candidates, critics say. Turnout in Moscow on Sunday was just under 22%, data showed.\n\n\"We are being forced to vote and we have to report to the bosses,\" said one soldier wearing civilian clothes who declined to be named. \"We are not told who to vote for but we are told to fulfill our civic duty.\"\n\nThe defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSunday's local and regional elections took place across all of Russia's 11 time zones. United Russia also suffered a setback in an election for the Khabarovsk region's local parliament in the Far East, winning just two seats.\n\nBut the main focus was on Moscow, where the Central Election Commission refused in July to register a large number of opposition candidates, saying they had failed to collect enough signatures from genuine backers.\n\nThat decision triggered the biggest sustained protest movement in Russia since 2011-2013.\n\nPutin's own popularity rating, at more than 60%, is much higher than most Western leaders, though lower than it has been previously. The former KGB officer won a landslide election victory last year that will keep him in office until 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Gleb Stolyarov, Andrey Kuzmin, Maria Tsvetkova, Polina Nikolskaya and Tom Balmforth; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "Russia's ruling United Russia party, which supports President Vladimir Putin, has lost one third of its seats in the Moscow city assembly, final polling data cited by Russian news agencies showed on Monday, in an awkward setback for the Kremlin.
