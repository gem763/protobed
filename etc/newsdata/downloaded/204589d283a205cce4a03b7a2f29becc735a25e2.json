It was followed closely by Qalb Tounes, a relatively new party founded by jailed media mogul Nabil Karoui, at 15.6 percent or 33 seats.\n\nHours earlier, Karoui, one of the two candidates to advance to Tunisia's presidential runoff vote that will be held next week - claimed in a statement that his party had come first.\n\n\"We are the most visionary, we want to break the old establishment,\" Samy Achour, a senior member of Qalb Tounes' political bureau, told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut if exit polls are anything to go by, not everyone appears ready to do so.\n\nLow turnout\n\nIn an election day that came and went without much enthusiasm, voter turnout is expected to have been low - recorded at 23.49 percent at 2pm, six hours after the opening of the polls.\n\nSharan Grewal, a visiting fellow at Brookings focused on North Africa, predicted a lower turnout compared with the first round of Tunisia's presidential election last month, which stood at 49 percent. The main reason, he said, was that some of the supporters of Kais Saied, Karoui's opponent in the upcoming presidential runoff, \"stayed home\" as the academic has no party and did not endorse any party or list\".\n\n\"Several parties including Ennahdha ... tried to court his voters, but it remains to be seen how they did,\" Grewal added.\n\n191006174533200\n\nIn Sousse, on the Gulf of Hammamet, one voter said he was the only person in a crowded coffee shop sporting a blue index finger - the telltale sign of those who cast their vote.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Zohra Eltaief, a 65-year-old retired nurse, said she voted for list number two, of Abir Moussi's party. Moussi is often refered to as being nostalgic of the era of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled Tunisia for 24 years before being toppled in a 2011 civilian uprising that forced him to flee.\n\n\n\n\"Moussi is a lawyer and has been always involved in politics, she is the extension of Bourguiba and Ben Ali who were devoted to the country,\" Eltajef said. \"Today, she is the only one who is able to stop the obscurantism of Ennahda and its allies.\"\n\nMonths of coalition talks?\n\nAccording to the exit poll, Karama, a conservative coalition led by lawyer Seiffedine Makhlouf, came in third with 18 seats, followed by the recently formed Tahya Tounes secular party led by current Prime Minister Youssef Chahed with 16 seats.\n\n\"As in 2011 and 2014, the winning party will need to form a coalition to gain a majority,\" Grewal said. \"The big question here is whether that coalition will include both the top two parties, Ennahdha and Qalb Tounes. During the campaign period, both ruled out a coalition between them.\"\n\n191005074153980\n\nThis, says Grewal, could mean weeks or even months of negotiations. \"No party has over 20 percent, and it will take at least four parties to even form a government,\" he added.\n\nSarah Yerkes, a fellow in Carnegie's Middle East Program, said she did not expect Ennahdha and Qalb Tunes to work together.\n\n\"If Ennahda is asked to form a government, it will likely do so with a variety of smaller parties and independents,\" she said.\n\nYerkes added that if the exit poll is confirmed, the relatively weak performance of the top two parties compared with the previous parliamentary election in 2014 highlighted \"how much more divided the political scene is today\". Five years ago, Nidaa Tounes came first with almost 38 percent of the vote, followed by Ennahdha with nearly 28 percent.\n\nMore than 1,500 lists and 15,000 candidates on Sunday ran for 217 seats, with registered political parties and independents vying for control of the single chamber.\n\nWhile Tunisia is often referred to as the only success story to come out of the Arab Spring, the elections were held against a backdrop of spiralling food prices, inflation and more than 15 percent unemployment.\n\nPreliminary results will be announced on October 10 and official results on November 17. The assembly will then be given two months to choose a prime minister and form a new government.", "description": "Ennahdha projected to win 17.5 percent of the vote, slightly ahead of Qalb Tunes, tipped to secure 15.6 percent.", "authors": ["Sofia Barbarani"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/d5c20089b7b948eebd3d7f58624aafe9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
