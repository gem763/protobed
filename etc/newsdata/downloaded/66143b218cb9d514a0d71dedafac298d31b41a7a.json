They have not yet appeared before the commission.\n\n'Relocation costs'\n\nIn early 2015 the two companies entered into negotiations with Transnet after the assembly point for locomotives was changed from Pretoria to Durban. The leader of the negotiating team from Transnet was the group's then-Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh.\n\nAs the commission heard earlier in the week, Bombardier quoted an extra R618m for relocating, and China North Rail R647m. These figures were accepted by Transnet's then-CEO Siyabonga Gama.\n\nMnyandu told the commission that, by the time Transnet halted the payments for the relocation, Bombardier had been paid R248m and China South Rail had been paid R368m.\n\nHe said that, in the view of MNS, Gama had breached the Public Finance Management Act by incurring fruitless and wasteful expenditure and not interrogating the reasons for the costs.\n\nGama was fired in late 2018. Singh later joined Eskom. He resigned in January 2018.\n\n'Unjustifiable'\n\nThe locomotives were part of a controversial contract for 1 064 new engines meant to upgrade and modernise Transnet's fleet. But the tender has been dogged by allegations of kickbacks, fraud and irregularities after prices increased from R38.9bn to R56bn.\n\nMnyandu on Friday quoted from a report by Liliwe Rail Solutions, a consultant which MNS contracted as independent expert to probe whether the costs were warranted. The report's findings, which he read out on Friday, were that no relocation had taken place, the costs billed to Transnet were unjustifiable, and the cost increases were approved without documentation by Transnet.\n\nIn early 2015, neither group had yet set up shop in Johannesburg, the inquiry has heard. According to some initial email correspondence, the move to Durban was expected to actually produce savings on certain items, as the assembly points for the locomotives would now be nearer to Durban port, where the locomotive parts would be shipped from abroad.", "description": "Two transportation companies contracted to build billions of rands' worth of locomotives for Transnet had 'no justification' for hiking costs by R1.25bn as a relocation fee, the state capture commission has heard.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1886/dfa6c5ad7f5d4fae9f8c17a41f7f760e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-31"}
