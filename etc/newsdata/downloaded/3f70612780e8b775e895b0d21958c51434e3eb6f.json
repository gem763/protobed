That new allegation was included in an article, excerpting an upcoming book about Kavanaugh classmate Deborah Ramirez, who had claimed the future justice pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her at another time at a different Yale party.\n\nIn writing about the new allegation, the story did not initially include the detail that the woman supposedly involved in the incident declined to be interviewed, and that her friends say she doesn\u2019t recall it. The article was revised to include that information, with an editor\u2019s note explaining the revision. It was not immediately clear why that detail had been left out.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The president has jumped to the defense of his Supreme Court appointee on Twitter, saying \u201cthe one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh, assaulted by lies and fake news.\u201d\n\nTrump said Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\n\nThe newspaper also apologized for a tweet sent out Saturday through the account of its opinion section, where the Kavanaugh piece ran. The tweet said, in part, that \u201chaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun.\u201d The Times later said that the tweet was \u201cclearly inappropriate and offensive.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The New York Times is under fire for its story about a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brett-kavanaugh-new-york-times.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
