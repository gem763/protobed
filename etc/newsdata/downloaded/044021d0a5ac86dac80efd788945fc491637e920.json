As Techmash general director Vladimir Lepin told Russian news, \u201cwe aim to wrap up [testing] and to begin taking orders from the military, if all goes according to plan.\u201d\n\nThe S-8OFP \"Broneboyschik\" (Russian for \u201carmor piercer\u201d) is the latest entry into the S-8 family, originating as a 1970s series of Soviet rockets with a wide range of warheads from fuel-air explosives (FAE) to flares.\n\nThough virtually indistinguishable from the outside, the S-8OFP brings several key internal improvements to the S-8 system. It houses a smaller but more powerful engine, which gives Techmash engineers room to install a much larger and heavier warhead. The result is a rocket that boasts not only more firepower but a more sophisticated payload delivery system.\n\nWhereas previous S-8 series rockets only went off within a set distance from a target, Techmash states that the S-8OFP has an intelligent proximity fuse that can explode in front, within, or behind a target to maximize impact against heavy armor and clustered groups. That is, the S-8OFP can be calibrated to penetrate certain surfaces prior to detonation.\n\nThis newfound flexibility in target acquisition is supposed to translate into exponential performance gains: \u201cin combat capabilities, it [the S-8OFP] exceeds the old model by several times,\u201d says Lepin. It also abandons the S-8\u2019s old ballistite propellant in favor of a new composite fuel that allows for increased effective range, estimated at 6 km as compared with the 4 km of its predecessor.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A deadly new weapon.", "authors": ["Mark Episkopos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r68Z.K9J5VIer9TDmanVgw--~B/aD05NDI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/c733f15993432cf0148db32b935dd411", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
