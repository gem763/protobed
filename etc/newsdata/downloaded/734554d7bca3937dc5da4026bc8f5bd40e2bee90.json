By which we think they mean he avoids appearing in court, rather than wheeling himself out of jail in one of his own bins.\n\nAlthough the worst thing about this story is that there\u2019s no sign that he found out about any Valve secrets while stealing from them, so maybe they really aren\u2019t making Half-Life 3 after all\u2026\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Valve Index pre-orders begin at \u00a3919, Half-Life VR still a possibility\n\nMORE: Valve has been \u2018out-businessed\u2019 claims developer, as Steam loses more exclusives to Epic Games\n\nMORE: Valve criticised for allowing \u2018Rape Day\u2019 game on Steam", "description": "A Seattle man manged to burgle Steam owners Valve multiple times by throwing their computers into a bin and selling them at GameStop.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_157956225_preview-39ea_1570607665.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
