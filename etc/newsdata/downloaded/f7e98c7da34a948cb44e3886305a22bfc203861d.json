Britain's parliament three times rejected a deal negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May, which included the so-called backstop mechanism to keep the seamless Irish border open.\n\nJohnson will meet Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday to build his case for a revised deal that he hopes will be agreed at an EU leaders' summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\nA UK government source said the two leaders, who have not met since Johnson became prime minister in July, would dine on snails, salmon and cheese.\n\nHe declined to name the venue for their meeting, though the Bouquet Garni restaurant -- an 18th-century building in the medieval heart of Luxembourg -- has snails and salmon on its set-lunch menu.\n\nBrexit Minister Stephen Barclay and the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will also meet in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\n\"TIME IS RUNNING OUT\"\n\nWhile Johnson and his ministers have in recent days talked up progress in negotiations with Brussels, the EU side has consistently sounded less optimistic, emphasising that Britain must come up with new ideas.\n\nIn an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday, Juncker said there was no possibility of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by May.\n\n\"I believe we need to maintain a decent relationship with Britain, and I am not optimistic when it comes to finding alternative arrangements that will allow us to limit the Irish backstop,\" Juncker said.\n\n\"We do not know what the British want in detail, precisely and exactly, and we are still waiting for alternative proposals. I hope we can get it, but time is running out.\"\n\nJohnson's government has yet to publicly announce new proposals on how to solve the Northern Irish border issue. It insists that the backstop, an insurance policy to prevent a return to a hard border, is unacceptable.\n\nJohnson has pledged to leave the EU with or without a deal on Oct. 31, even though British lawmakers have passed a law which would force him to request a delay beyond that date if he is unable to reach a deal with the EU. His government has stepped up preparations to mitigate possible food, fuel and medicine shortages in case of a no-deal exit.\n\n\"We want a deal. This cannot include the backstop,\" the British government source said, adding that Johnson will make clear to Juncker that even if the EU offers him an extension of the Brexit deadline beyond Oct. 31 he will reject it.", "description": "Johnson to explore Brexit deal with Juncker over lunch of snails and salmon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8F0FV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
