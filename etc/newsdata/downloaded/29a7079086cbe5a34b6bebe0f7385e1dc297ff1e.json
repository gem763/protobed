Australia updated its travel advice to warn its citizens of the possible changes.\n\nIf passed, it will usher in sweeping changes to Indonesian law that activists have described as disastrous for all \u2013 particularly for women, religious and sexual minorities \u2013 as well as for press freedom.\n\nActivists called on Widodo to act, describing it, on the eve of his second term, as a defining moment of his presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment he will be remember for. What legacy does Jokowi want to have? As a president who is remembered for including a dictatorial and anti-human rights agenda in the penal code?\u201d said petition author and women\u2019s rights activist, Tunggal Pawestri. \u201cIf he really cares about his image as a president of the people then he needs to follow the voice of the people.\u201d\n\nOutcry at Indonesia draft criminal code that could see unmarried couples jailed Read more\n\nAmong a series of contentious provisions are articles that would outlaw defacto relationships and extramarital sex \u2013 an article activists fear would in effect criminalise same-sex relations \u2013 while insulting the president would also be a criminal offence punishable by 3.5 years in prison.\n\nUsing the hashtag #semuabisakena, meaning \u201cthis effects everyone\u201d, the petition highlights problematic articles, including those that would also criminalise buskers, beggars and sex workers.\n\nThe petition also notes an article in the proposed code that refers to \u201cliving law\u201d which Human Rights Watch says could be interpreted to legitimise hundreds of discriminatory sharia bylaws already in place at the local level.\n\n\u201cThis petition has attracted the attention of a lot of people who have realised, this is the situation that we will have if this bill is passed,\u201d said Tunggal Pawestri.\n\nPawestri first started the petition in January 2018 to focus on how the draft penal code \u2013 which has been decades in the making \u2013 would negatively affect women and LGBT people, but in recent months it has morphed into a more broad critique, garnering more than 440,000 signatures in total.\n\nIn the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, the bill is set to divide Indonesian liberals and an increasingly socially conservative society.\n\nCivil society groups say they submitted comprehensive recommendations and revisions to the draft code, but they have largely been ignored.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds protested outside the parliament rejecting not only the draft penal code, but also a controversial law passed this week on the anti-corruption commission, which is widely expected to weaken the body\u2019s investigative powers.\n\nThe parliament \u2013 the source of more than 20 corruption suspects in recent years \u2013 has been derided for passing that law in secrecy and record time.\n\nCritics have also pointed out that the draft penal code, which could be passed as early as next week, also halves the sentence of those convicted of corruption or those \u201cunlawfully enriching themselves\u201d from four to two years.", "description": "Petition gathers more than 300,000 signatures in 24 hours after details of draft criminal code emerge", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17929bdd4dadde1858c8c1f24a4420fc31e056f/0_377_6047_3630/master/6047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce5a7c6c709719bb38a864c7f25f080c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
