Business investment in structures plunged at a 15.3% rate in the third quarter after a sharp 11.1% drop in the second quarter.\n\nResidential investment, which had been falling for six quarters, finally saw an increase, rising at a 5.1% rate, a gain that reflected the impact lower mortgage rates from the Federal Reserve's rate cuts were having on sales and construction plans.\n\nGovernment spending slowed to a growth rate of 2%, down from a 4.8% gain in the second quarter, with federal spending and state and local government spending all slowing.\n\nThe trade deficit, which has widened as Chinese retaliatory tariffs have hurt farm sales, trimmed GDP growth by about 0.1 percentage-point in the third quarter.\n\nGrowth this year is forecast to come in around 2.3%, which will be a disappointment to the president, who has repeatedly proclaimed that his economic policies featuring tax cuts, deregulation and tough enforcement of trade agreements would lift the country out of the doldrums of the slowest economic expansion in the post World War II period.\n\nGrowth last year was boosted by Trump's $1.5 billion tax cut passed in 2017 and billions of dollars in extra government spending approved last year.\n\nWithout that support, economists had forecast a slowdown this year. They also say that Trump's trade war with China, by disrupting supply chains and hurting business confidence, will shave about a half-percentage point from the already slower GDP figure.\n\nThe president, however, has blamed the Federal Reserve for the weaker growth, calling Fed officials \"boneheads\" for raising rates four times last year and being slow to cut rates this year.\n\nThe central bank is expected to slash its key policy rate for a third time when this week's meeting ends on Wednesday. Economists believe without the Fed's efforts to lower rates, the economy might already be in a recession.\n\nMost analysts think the current record-long expansion, now in its 11th year, will avoid a downturn in 2020, a presidential election year, but growth will be far below the 3% Trump has promised to achieve.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he does not have a recession in his forecast, but a downturn can't be ruled out, especially if the United States and China do not achieve at least a cease-fire that keeps further tariff hikes from going into effect. That would slow GDP growth even further.\n\n\"President Trump's trade war is doing significant damage to the economy,\" Zandi said. \"If the economy slows even more than I am anticipating, I think that could ignite a recession.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
