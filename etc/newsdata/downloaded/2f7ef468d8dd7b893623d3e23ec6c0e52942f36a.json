Di Modica is a client of Polich Tallix.\n\nThe bull was left with an 8-inch-long hole in its right horn and several scratch marks after the attack on Saturday.\n\nMichelle V. Agins/The New York Times/Redux\n\nThe estimated cost to repair the structure is between $10,000 and $15,000, the highest amount for a fix in the statue's history, Piccolo said.\n\n\"The most we've had is an occasional marking,\" Piccolo said. \"This is the first serious vandalism that the bull has experienced in 30 years.\"\n\nHe expects that someone from Polich Tallix will come down to see the damage this week.\n\nWhile Di Modica is disappointed by the damage, he doesn\u2019t anticipate it will take long to repair.\n\nThe bull, a famed 7,100-pound bronze statue, has made the Bowling Green park its home since Dec. 20, 1989, when it was installed as a work of guerrilla art.\n\nPiccolo expects all repairs and renovations on the statue to be done in October, well before the 30th anniversary celebration.\n\nMichelle V. Agins/The New York Times/Redux\n\nTevon Varlack, 42, has been arrested and charged in the incident, a spokesman for the New York City Police Department told ABC News.\n\nVarlack was allegedly seen \"striking the 'Charging Bull' statue with a metal object,\" later discovered to be a banjo made of metal with sharpened edges, the spokesman said.\n\nVarlack, from Houston, and his attorney could not be reached by ABC News.\n\nThe news of Polich Tallix taking on the repairs was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.", "description": "The", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/bull-1-rd-er-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
