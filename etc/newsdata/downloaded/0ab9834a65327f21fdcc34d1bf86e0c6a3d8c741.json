After Samsung's issues with the Galaxy Fold, and the delay of Huawei's own offering, 2019 has become a kind of bendable purgatory.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I found myself racing across Berlin to have a spontaneous, ten minutes hands on with the Mate X.\n\nAs the headline reveals, my time with the Mate X was extremely limited - so these are topline first impressions.\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nImage: Tegan Jones/Gizmodo Australia\n\nHuawei's first foldable device has a 6.6-inch front display and 6.38-inch rear display. Unlike the Samsung, which is an in-fold, the Mate X is an out-fold. This means that it folds outward, turning one large screen into two, which are exposed at all times.\n\nThe newer versions of the Mate X will have Huawei's new Kirin 990 processor, 512GB storage, 8GB RAM, a 4,500mAH battery, fingerprint reader power button and 2480x2200 resolution.\n\nIt also has the same camera setup as the P30 Pro. The includes a 40 MP SuperSpectrum Sensor (Wide angle, f/1.6), 20 MP Ultra-wide angle (f/2.2), 8 MP Tele lens (f/3.4) and a Time-of-Flight lens. The only thing missing is the front facing camera.\n\nHands On With Samsung's New Galaxy Fold New form factors are always exciting, but nothing else in recent years has captured people's imaginations quite like foldable screens. When it comes to the Galaxy Fold, drama has ensued. From its micro-debut at Samsung's Developer Conference in 2018, to faulty review units, there have been many question marks around how it would eventually perform.

It also looks really gorgeous on it.\n\nRotating the device also results in quick app justified changes, which is nice.\n\nCamera\n\nI wasn't able to keep any camera samples, but this thing is rocking the same setup as the P30 Pro, which is one of the best camera phones of the year.\n\nBoth the front snaps are good. Damn good.\n\nThe only downside is that there is no selfie camera, which is god-tier on the P30 Pro. Instead, you have to fold the phone up and turn it around so the image of yourself appears on the smaller screen.\n\nIt's better than nothing at all, but I'd prefer a dedicated front-facing camera.\n\nWhile the Mate X is perhaps a little heavy for a phone, it's light for a tablet. And in general I didn't find it to be cumbersome.\n\nHowever, it is super thick compared to a modern phone, but that's an issue that all foldables will have for the foreseeable future.\n\nSplit Keyboard\n\nI was apprehensive about this when I first saw it, but became an instant convert. It's very comfortable to type on.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Fold also has this feature.\n\nWhat's Not So Good?\n\nThe Crease\n\nDue to being an out-fold, you can feel the crease in the screen even when using it flat.\n\nTo be fair, you can also feel this with the Samsung Galaxy Fold - but it's more pronounced on the Mate X.\n\nI imagine you would get used it it quite quickly, but it is a little distracting at first.\n\nI imagine future generations of the product will be able to improve on this.\n\nThe Button\n\nThe read little clasp is The Button\n\nTo pop the Mate X open you need to press a button. It takes some getting used to and I'm not sure I'm a fan.\n\nOn the one hand it keeps the device securely fastened, but I would rather the convenience of simply opening up without having to take an extra step.\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nWhile Huawei has been colloquially talking about the future of its devices in Australia, including its foldable, it's difficult to say if and when the Mate X could hit our shores. And when it does it's probably going to be pricey.\n\nIf it does, it may suffer the same fate as the upcoming Mate 30, which is likely to launch without proper Android or Google applications thanks to the ban and trade war with the U.S. government. These are important factors to consider.\n\nThat being said, I enjoyed my short-lived time with the Mate X. I'm a big fan of the P30 Pro camera upgrade and it was a lot of fun to use.", "description": "It was unclear whether foldables were going to be a thing at IFA 2019.
