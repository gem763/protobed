The judge has suggested prosecutors have improper motivations and engage in \"trickery.\"\n\nFirst Assistant District Attorney Robert Vines, who is white, argued in the recusal motion that Landry has \"engaged in abusive, inappropriate and/or bullying behavior\" toward prosecutors, staff of the district attorney's office, victims and witnesses.\n\nSome of the recusal motions are scheduled to be heard Wednesday by 16th Judicial District Court Judges Anthony Thibodeaux and Lewis Pitman.\n\n'This is a violation'\n\n\u201cThis is a violation of the constitutional rights of the people who elected me,\u201d The Daily Iberian quoted Landry as saying last month during a hearing when Vines began filing recusal motions in cases on her docket.\n\nLandry, who was elected to her position in 2002, did not respond to requests last week for comment. Before taking office as a judge, she served for nine years as an assistant district attorney.\n\nLandry ruled in an unrelated case in June that one of her fellow 16th Judicial Court judges should not be allowed to sentence a woman in a manslaughter case, arguing years earlier he failed to issue a protective order that might have prevented her from shooting and killing her husband.\n\n\u201c\u201cThis is a violation of the constitutional rights of the people who elected me.\u201d\u201d 16th Judicial District Court Judge Lori Landry\n\nIn the move to remove Landry from her criminal cases, the district attorney's office claims she threatened to stick a pen in the eardrum of a prosecutor and a defense attorney. When the prosecutor asked why the eardrum, Landry, according to the motion, said, \"Because, girl, it hurts, but it doesn't kill you. It makes you suffer. See what I'm saying?\"\n\nBecause of Landry's actions, the district attorney's office argued in its motion that its ability to prosecute cases in a fair and orderly manner has been affected. Vines also said there has been serious harm to the public because of Landry's actions.\n\n\"Filing a motion to recuse a judge on the grounds of bias is always a step to be taken with great deliberation,\" Vines argues the motion.\n\nCommunity rallies around judge\n\nCommunity members have rallied around Landry, offering her support at earlier hearings and supporting her in Facebook posts.\n\n\"We know of the trickery and injustice that is happening in the 16th JDC with this very targeted, bullying, and racist tactic to have Judge Landry removed from hearing all criminal cases in the 16th JDC because she does not want to play jump rope or be friends with the DA Office,\" Robby Carrier-Bethel posted on Facebook. \"Judge Landry is honorable, and a woman of God that has brought compassion, Integrity and judicial fairness with her to the bench (something all of them should have).\"\n\n\u201c\u201cFiling a motion to recuse a judge on the grounds of bias is always a step to be taken with great deliberation.\u201d\u201d First Assistant District Attorney Robert Vines\n\nNearly 100 people, many of them African Americans, stood on the steps of the Iberia Parish Courthouse earlier this month to support Landry before a scheduled hearing to remove her from 75 cases, KLFY reported.\n\nAfter the hearing was postponed, supporters left the courtroom.\n\n\"It's despicable that just because the district attorney\u2019s office can\u2019t get their way that they\u2019re going to decide, 'Well we want you to be removed.' Like he has that much power,\u201d said Khadijah Rashad, who helped organize Landry's supporters.\n\nRashad has also started a petition to support the judge, KLFY reported.\n\n\u201cPeople believe and support Judge Landry because of her integrity, because of her willingness to look at the evidence and if there is no evidence then the case is dismissed,\u201d Rashad said.\n\nThe accusations\n\nThe motion to remove Landry has been added to virtually every criminal case that has been assigned to her with only the docket number and the defendant's name changing.\n\nProsecutors laid out more than 30 specific instances in the motion they argue support concerns that Landry is biased.\n\nIn one 2017 example, Landry implied members of the district attorney's office \"knew or should have known\" that former Iberia Parish Sheriff's deputies were involved in misbehavior, according to court filings. In a 2018 example, Landry called the district attorney's pre-trial diversion program \"highway robbery.\"\n\nLandry also told an assistant district attorney during open court in September that she had a \"sour face\" and that she was \"salty,\" according to the recusal motion.\n\nThe district attorney's office has changed its policy to not allow unrecorded bench conferences with Landry \"as a result of Judge Landry's abusive or otherwise improper comments,\" the motion states.\n\nThe motion also said Landry suggested victims are responsible for becoming victims of their crimes and repeatedly disparaged victims. In one sentencing hearing involving incest, Landry \"suggested that the children's parents let the grandparents babysit the children too often, and that they had made 'decisions they should be paying attention to.'\"\n\n\u201c\u201cAll that the District Attorney's Office wants is what it is entitled to \u2014 a judge who fairly and impartially applies the laws to the facts before her and who treats attorneys, staff, witnesses, victims, defendants, and the public with respect.\u201d\u201d First Assistant District Attorney Robert Vines\n\nLandry's alleged bias against prosecutors has caused harm to the public, the motion said.\n\nAn Iberia Parish defendant was on probation and was arrested and faced new charges, including assault by drive-by shooting and simple battery. Prosecutors were moving forward with a motion to revoke that probation, but Landry said the defendant was in \"substantial compliance\" and \"refused to hear the evidence of the new charges,\" according to court documents.\n\nTwo months later, the defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and attempted second-degree murder.\n\n\"The allegations in that case are that she shot a 15-year-old boy, after previously threatening him because he was associating with someone who allegedly stole her friend's dog,\" Vines wrote in the motion.\n\nLandry's \"accusations and mistreatments had been escalating,\" Vines argues in the motion.\n\n\"All that the District Attorney's Office wants is what it is entitled to \u2014 a judge who fairly and impartially applies the laws to the facts before her and who treats attorneys, staff, witnesses, victims, defendants, and the public with respect.\"\n\nFollow Ashley White on Twitter @AshleyyDi.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/27/prosecutors-want-black-judge-recused-300-criminal-cases/2480305001/", "description": "Iberia Parish judge Lori Landry has questioned the large number of black Louisianans incarcerated by the district attorney's office", "authors": ["Ashley White", "Published P.M.
