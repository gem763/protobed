The second, AB 51, protects victims who signed forced arbitration clauses that would require harassment claims to be settled in private.\n\nRead original story California Governor Gavin Newsom Signs #MeToo Bill Preventing \u2018No-Rehire\u2019 Clauses Into Law At TheWrap", "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom this month signed into law an anti-sexual harassment bill earlier that prevents employers from implementing \u201cno-rehire\u201d clauses in settlements for sexual-harassment victims.AB 749, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2020, states that \u201can agreement to settle an employment", "authors": ["J.
