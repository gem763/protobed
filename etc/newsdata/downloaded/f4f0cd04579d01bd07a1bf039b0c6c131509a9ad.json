Month-to-date, the iShares Momentum Factor ETF (BATS:MTUM) is down more than 1%, while the iShares Value Factor ETF (BATS:VLUE) is up more than 7%.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening under the hood? Long story short, investors were hyper-concerned about a recession in August. In response to rising recession fears, investors ditched economically sensitive value stocks that require a good economy to head higher, and piled into momentum growth stocks that don\u2019t require a good economy to head higher (because they have such strong secular tailwinds).\n\nIn September, though, recession fears have backed off. The Federal Reserve has sounded as dovish as they\u2019ve ever sounded. China and the U.S. have resumed trade talks. Long bond yields have moved higher. The curve has mostly un-inverted. In response to these easing recession fears, investors are unwinding their momentum trade. That is, they are booking profits on their momentum stocks, and buying the dip in value stocks, since these stocks should now move higher that the economic outlook is improving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, the September momentum-to-value shift is actually a vote of confidence in the economy from the equity markets.\n\nThe last time a momentum-to-value shift like this happened? Mid-2016, when the global economy was in the process of shaking off slowing growth headwinds.\n\nWhat happens next? All stocks go higher \u2014 momentum stocks and value stocks. Broadly, the global economy isn\u2019t going into a recession. On the contrary, conditions are improving. As conditions do improve, both value and momentum stocks will move higher over the next few quarters.\n\nThe implication right now? Selectively buy the dip in high quality momentum stocks. Which ones are on my shopping list? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Shopify (SHOP)\n\nMomentum Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Shopify (SHOP) More\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nYTD Gain Before Selloff: Almost 200%\n\n% Off High: 15%\n\nFirst up, we have e-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which \u2014 thanks to a near 200% gain from January to August 2019 \u2014 has been one of the most unstoppable stocks this year. But, as we all know, there is no such thing as an unstoppable stock. Indeed, SHOP stock has been stopped recently. Over the past few weeks, the stock has shed 15% as investors have booked profits on what has been an 800% rally over the past three years.\n\nThe \u201cbuy the dip\u201d thesis on SHOP stock revolves around three things.\n\nFirst, the fundamentals underlying Shopify stock remain rock solid \u2014 the company just reported (yet another) 50%-plus volume growth quarter with robust margin expansion, and the underlying decentralization and direct retail trends supporting the growth narrative remain vigorous. The only thing that has changed is the stock is now cheaper.\n\nSecond, this momentum trade unwind won\u2019t last forever. It\u2019s tough to see investors selling Shopify stock and buying Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stock for the foreseeable future. They won\u2019t. This momentum-to-value shift is short lived, and is simply a reversion to the norm (momentum\u2019s out-performance relative to value got over-extended in the summer). Once we do get back to the norm, investors will pile back into SHOP stock because this stock is supported by one of the most robust growth narratives in the market.\n\nThird, excluding the late 2018 selloff, corrections in SHOP stock usually bottom out once they hit a 20% peak-to-trough decline. We are almost there today, so it looks like the worst of this sell-off is over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkta (OKTA)\n\nMomentum Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Okta (OKTA) More\n\nStory continues", "description": "In early September, we have seen a violent, significant and largely unprecedented shift in the investment landscape from momentum stocks to value stocks.
