He was not arrested. Inquiries are ongoing.'\n\nReturn to work: In August. Spacey made his first public appearance at Rome Museum, after prosecutors announced they were dropping an indecent assault and battery charge\n\n'Under caution' means the interview was recorded and can be used in future prosecutions. British police don't identify suspects until they have been charged.\n\nLos Angeles County prosecutors said last year they were investigating allegations of a 2016 sexual assault by Spacey for possible criminal charges.\n\nA Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office spokeswoman confirmed last month it 'has a case under review,' but would not say whether it involves the same 2016 incident.\n\nProsecutors there declined last year to file charges over a 1992 allegation because the statute of limitations had run out.\n\nSpacey is also fighting a federal lawsuit in California filed by a massage therapist, who says Spacey groped him, tried to kiss him and forced him to grab Spacey's genitals.\n\nThe groping allegation was first brought in 2017, days after Spacey's first accuser, actor Anthony Rapp, said Spacey climbed on top of him on a bed when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26.\n\nSpacey said he did not remember such an encounter with Rapp but apologised if the allegations were true.\n\nSpacey also used the statement to disclose he is gay.\n\nA slew of other accusations followed, leading to Spacey's removal from the completed movie All the Money in the World, which was reshot with actor Christopher Plummer.", "description": "Kevin Spacey stepped out for dinner in Belgrade on Tuesday, three months after a Massachusetts prosecutor dropped a groping case against him.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19480282-0-image-a-18_1570607787550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
