People are dying.\"\n\n\"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\" climate skeptic Trump tweeted a few hours later, alongside a clip of the speech.\n\nThe trolling of the activist - who has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism - racked up more than 16 000 responses in three hours, many of them attacking the president.\n\n\"DonaldTrump picking on an innocent young girl is absolutely disgusting!!\" wrote one user.\n\nThunberg later changed her Twitter biography to read: \"A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\"\n\n\"When your troll president gets out-trolled,\" tweeted American businessman and columnist Jeff Yang, alongside an image of Thunberg's new bio.\n\nThunberg and Trump were briefly in the same small room as they arrived for the summit, with video showing the teen glowering at the president as he passed by with his entourage.\n\nThunberg has become the global face of a growing youth movement against climate inaction that mobilised millions in a worldwide strike on Friday.\n\nHer struggle began quietly in August 2018 when she skipped school for the first three weeks, and then on Fridays to spend the day outside Sweden's parliament with a sign labeled \"School strike for climate\".\n\nIn August, she crossed the Atlantic in a two-week journey on a sailboat to attend the climate summit in New York. She refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions caused by planes.", "description": "Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg responded to US President Donald Trump's mocking of her online by embracing his words on her Twitter page.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9381/45341c91bdf14005a5da87f8a5e92e56.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
