I\u2019m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD. I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it. Because things can turn around.

A therapist will help a patient focus on desensitization surrounding the event. The goal of the treatment results in a person being trained to replace negatives feelings, such as shame or fear, with positive ones, such as a feeling of strength for having survived their traumatic event.\n\n\"I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it,\" the body-positivity activist tweeted. \"Because things can turn around. I promise.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Jamil has praised EMDR for helping with her mental health.\n\n\"It\u2019s ok not to be,\u201d Jamil wrote on Instagram in July, referring to feeling happy. \u201cWell done for just getting through the damn day. I had a therapy called EMDR that I used for depression, anxiety, eating disorder issues and PTSD, and if you should be lucky enough to access any mental healthcare I would urge you to spend your money on that before ANYTHING else that isn\u2019t a necessity for your life. Saved my life.\"\n\nIn an interview with Elle in January, Jamil revealed that, \"within a matter of months,\" the therapy helped her extract \"the root of the problem, which meant that I didn't have to deal with the symptoms anymore,\" adding that at the age of 29, any money she had saved for corrective or beauty items were now dedicated to therapy.\n\nShe called it the \"biggest act of self love I've ever done.\"\n\nThere is so much work to do in Improving awareness and mental health care, and we need to further de-stigmatize the conversation around asking for help.
