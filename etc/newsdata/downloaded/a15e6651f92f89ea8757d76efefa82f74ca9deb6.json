(AP) - A clinic quietly constructed in southern Illinois to meet demand for abortion services by residents in nearby states is close to opening.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri says Wednesday is the opening day for its Fairview Heights clinic.\n\nThe new 18,000-square-foot facility will provide surgical and medication abortions, family planning services, annual exams, sexually transmitted infection testing and HIV prevention.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s construction began last year, but details weren\u2019t released until near completion to avoid protesters and potential construction delays.\n\nMissouri is among several conservative states to pass new abortion restrictions in the hope that the increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nPlanned Parenthood officials say Illinois is well-positioned to serve as a health care hub for the region.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A clinic quietly constructed in southern Illinois to meet demand for abortion services by residents in nearby states is close to opening.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
