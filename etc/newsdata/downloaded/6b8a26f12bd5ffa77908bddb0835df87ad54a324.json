This week, we're talking with Nicholas Bernhardt, CEO and co-founder of corporate social responsibility (CSR) tech start-up, Informed 365.\n\nIn 128 words or less, explain your business idea\n\nInformed 365 has one simple mission: we want to help users see and understand their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) data. We help any organisation (from non-profits to global enterprises to governments) to visualise critical data in a meaningful way that allows them to effectively use their data to make more informed decisions and improve efficiency in the business.\n\nWe do this through providing real-time web-based applications covering Supply Chains / Ethical Sourcing (including Modern Slavery Act), Business Intelligence (e.g. Greenhouse Gas tracking and calculating, automated reporting, etc.) and Climate Change resilience. Our applications use ultra-fast analytics, big real-time data and connectivity via Application Programming Interfaces (API) coupled with customised dashboards to convert any data into actionable insights.\n\nWhat strategies are you using to grow and finance your idea?\n\nInitially, Informed 365 grew via organic growth and word-of-mouth. We nurtured a database of executives in the sustainability and procurement space and made sure that we regularly contacted them to stay front-of-mind. In line with our overriding social and environmental ambitions we also took a very pro-active and vocal activist stand on pressing issues such as Modern Slavery and Climate Change.\n\nOnce we were ready to take Informed 365 to the next level, we reached out to Andrew Banks (Morgan & Banks, Talent 2, Shark Tank) as a potential equity partner. We specifically targeted Andrew as he\u2019d had extensive B2B experience, has unrivalled knowledge and expertise of growing companies and a network of connections. He has since become a pivotal partner to guide us to the next growth stages.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge facing your business?\n\nAustralia has a shortage of top-quality software engineers and developers. According to a 2018 UTS / Microsoft report \u201cnine of the top 15 most advertised positions were for developers, software engineers and user experience/user interface design roles.\u201d Thanks to communication technology, we are not only competing for talent with other Australian tech firms, but also with companies around the world.\n\nHow do you differentiate your business from your competitors?\n\nWe set out to develop a highly agile platform from which we can run scalable unlimited related applications that can evolve with a client\u2019s requirements. We are unique in that we have partnered up with leading third-party subject matter experts to provide clients with seamless end-to-end solutions. By aggregating such services we can deliver best-practice solutions that cover compliance, risk, sustainability, audits and assurance in one seamless web-based platform.\n\nIt may sound corny, but we are also genuinely passionate about what we do \u2013 we operate in the sustainability space as we believe in doing business more efficiently and reducing our impact on the environment and creating a stronger, fairer and more resilient society. We live and breathe sustainability.\n\nWhat one phone, tablet or PC application could you not live without?\n\nThe one application we couldn\u2019t work without is Slack. Slack allows us to have conversations in channels which can be organised by any metric such as project, team or subject. The platform ensures that the right people are in the conversation and information doesn\u2019t get lost. It integrates with the apps and services we use every day and there\u2019s visibility for everyone in the conversation.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best piece of business advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\n\u201cSurround yourself with smart people.\u201d The right circle of influence raises the bar and forces you to do better and be smarter. It's also crucial in business to have a knowledgeable team and network to draw-on for feedback, insight, collaboration and guidance. Being proactive in finding these people early-on is the best way to set yourself up for success.\n\nWant to see your startup featured in Elevator Pitch?
