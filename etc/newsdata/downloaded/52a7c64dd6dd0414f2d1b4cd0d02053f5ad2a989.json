I think she had a bad night. I think it was unfortunate. She said she was drinking. The whole thing was very unfortunate. I think the press is very dishonest because it's supposed to be off the record. But still, you don\u2019t say things like she said, which were just a little bit hurtful.\"\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nOn Saturday morning, the president tweeted that Westerhout has a \"fully enforceable confidentiality agreement.\"\n\n\"she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it,\" the tweet read.\n\nThe tweet also said Westerhout called Trump to \"apologize.\"\n\n\"Had a bad night,\" the tweet read. \"I fully understood and forgave her!\"\n\nWhile Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it.

Mentioned a couple of things about my children, but she is very good person and I always felt she did a good job. In all fairness, it was off the record ... but nevertheless, you don't say certain things. It was too bad. I just spoke to her \u2026 and I wished her well.\u201d\n\nAsked whether reports were true that Westerhout had said Trump made disparaging comments about his daughter, Tiffany, the president replied, \u201cOh no. Tiffany is great. I love Tiffany.\u201d\n\nHe said he they would speak by phone as soon as he got to Camp David.\n\n\"I'm going to say it's just absolutely false. She's a wonderful person.
