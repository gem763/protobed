What Arsenal did all those years ago, that's some going. What Liverpool are doing, winning all these games on the trot, though, is ridiculous,\u201d the former Gunners ace told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cThey weren't great the other day. When Leicester got to 1-1, they looked like the team that might nick it, even though Liverpool didn't deserve to lose.\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\n\u201cFor 70-odd minutes they were the better team, but they just kept on going and you have to get some breaks every now and again.\"\n\nMerson went on to hail Saturday's dramatic winner as a key moment in the title race which should not be forgotten at the end of the season.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \u201cNo-one is going to look back on October 5 and remember the penalty, but that spot-kick could've been a massive, massive goal.\n\n\u201cWhen you win league titles, everybody forgets about what happens in October and November.\n\n\u201cEverybody just thinks about what happened in April or May, but the penalty could be massive in the context of the title race.\u201d", "description": "Paul Merson has given his verdict on Liverpool's chances of emulating Arsenal's unbeaten 2003/04 Premier League season", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Afp", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article14005274.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-02-15-at-170347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
