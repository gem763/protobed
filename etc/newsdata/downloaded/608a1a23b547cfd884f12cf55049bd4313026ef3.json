'You've got to become them. Feel what they feel.'\n\nThe leader: The origin of Alpha, played by Samantha Morton, was revealed on Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead\n\n'And what do they feel?' Beta asked.\n\n'Nothing,' Alpha spat, her eyes cold.\n\nThe two of them had just sliced up a long line of walkers, and Alpha bragged about her lack of emotion as she yanked out their guts and plunked them into a bucket.\n\n'There's only two kinds of people left in this world,' she observed, blood covering her head and hands. 'The ones brave enough to walk with the dead and everybody else.'\n\nBeta beginning: The beginning of Beta, played by Ryan Hurst, was revealed during the season 10 episode on AMC\n\nBeta had been living at a hospital thronged by walkers, outside which Alpha and her daughter Lydia (Cassidy McClincy) had smeared themselves with blood to 'pass' untouched.\n\nAs they prowled the grounds of the hospital, they saw a woman pulled to pieces by a horde, and fled inside, where they encountered Beta.\n\n'Go on and try to kill us,' Alpha said to a large, bearded man in a ski mask down a hallway.\n\nSeeking shelter: Alpha and young Lydia were seeking shelter amid the zombie apocalypse\n\n'But know two things: One, I do not die easily. Two, you must also kill my daughter. Because I will not leave this earth without her.'\n\nIn a deep voice, the man proclaimed that he would allow them to stay there one night.\n\n'Is he a monster?' Lydia asked, as Beta disappeared.\n\nMenacing figure: The mother and daughter were met by a man in a ski mask with a machete\n\n'We're all monsters now,' Alpha whispered.\n\nShe went off to give her child a bath, and search out food for her to eat, hoping to make her tough enough to survive. She insisted that Lydia never call her 'Mama.'\n\nWhen Beta later asked for her name, she refused to tell him.\n\nNo name: The man asked for the woman's name, but she refused to tell him\n\n'The dead don't have names,' Alpha said. 'And we shouldn't, either. Without names or a past, those of us strong enough to still be alive out here can know each other on a primal level.'\n\nShe listened admiringly as the walkers growled outside.\n\n'They fear nothing,' Alpha considered. 'They want only to feed. They are free.'\n\nFear nothing: The woman admired the growling walkers outside because they lacked fear\n\nBeta, who'd been run out of his camp after a 'tussle with the dead,' said he liked the sound.\n\n'It's the only song I never want to end,' he admitted.\n\nThat evening, as Alpha walked around the hospital, a stream of walkers descended on her.\n\nClose call: Walkers descended on the woman as she walked around the hospital\n\nBeta showed up out of nowhere, and helped her dispatch them one by one.\n\n'I like killing with you,' Alpha told him, gutting the walkers afterward.\n\nShe and Lydia would use their blood and guts to disguise themselves, so Beta helped her pull open the ribs of a corpse.\n\nHead shot: The masked man killed a walker as it attacked the woman\n\n'Well done, Big Man,' Alpha praised him. 'Mr. B.'\n\n'I thought we didn't have names,' Beta retorted.\n\n'It's not a name. It's a letter,' Alpha pointed out.\n\nWell done: The woman started calling the masked man B\n\n'So if I'm B, what does that make you?' he asked.\n\n'A,' she offered, attempting to pull up his ski mask.\n\nHe grabbed her hand, ordering her to leave at sunrise.\n\nOrdered out: The masked man ordered the woman to leave when she tried to pull his mask up\n\nAs Alpha slept that night, Lydia covered herself in walker blood and went creeping around.\n\n'We're all monsters now,' she said, imitating her mom.\n\nWhen Alpha woke, she tried to find Lydia only to run into Beta in his quarters, where she saw photos of him and another person with their faces scratched out.\n\nUnder attack: The woman found herself attacked by a walker she recognized in the man's photo\n\nThe man in the photos, now a walker, emerged, and she stabbed him.\n\n'No!' Beta screamed as she killed his friend.\n\nHe destroyed everything in the room, and held his machete up to her.\n\nAlpha implored him to wait, saying: 'I know you better than you know yourself.'\n\nHelping out: Lydia tried to help her mother\n\n'You are god***ed dead. Just like me. But you are broken. You were made for this.'\n\nLydia ran out from her hiding place, trying to stop Beta from killing her mom, who hugged her to her side.\n\n'The world, it went dark so that we could see a new path,' Alpha crooned to Beta.\n\nNew path: Alpha talked about taking a new dark path together\n\n'Come, walk with me in the darkness. Walk with me, and you will never be alone again. My 'B.'\n\n'I am the end of the world,' he intoned. 'I am the end of the world.'\n\n'We are the end of the world,' she corrected. 'We are the end of the world.'\n\nWorld ending: The masked man was ready to strike with his machete but was talked down\n\nShe lifted his mask and looked for a long while at his face, then dropped it.\n\n'Come with us,' Alpha said.\n\n'I can't leave him,' he told her, breathing shakily.\n\n'You won't have to,' she noted, handing him a knife to peel off the man's face.\n\nYears passed, and Beta and Alpha were together in a forest.\n\nAs he shaved her head, she urged him to find new walkers to guard their boundaries.\n\nHead shave: Beta was shown years later shaving Alpha's head\n\nTwo sisters who 'had a gift for the dead' went with Beta as he hunted, at Alpha's command.\n\nOne sister was distracted, thinking of the baby she had given to the survivors at Oceanside.\n\n'The sun feels different today,' she said. 'Like it's burning right into our skin.'\n\nHerd growing: The Whisperers set out to grow their herd of zombies\n\n'Stop it,' her sibling said. 'He'll see that you're not committed to the cause. To her.'\n\n'Don't say that,' the first one begged.\n\n'I should have left you behind when I had the chance,' her sister said.\n\nGetting distracted: Frances got distracted while working to find walkers with her sister\n\nWalkers nearly took the distracted sister down, but Beta saved her, warning: 'You'll pay.'\n\nBack at camp, Alpha prevented her 'pack' from killing the girl.\n\n'You will never understand how it feels to abandon your child,' Alpha told Beta, who believed she had murdered Lydia some time before.\n\nShowing mercy: Alpha prevented the pack from killing the girl\n\nAlpha acknowledged that her pack had been tempted by life at Oceanside.\n\nShe said they would soon relearn that it was not life, but a fantasy.\n\n'Are you content?' Beta asked her. 'I have seen you wander away from the camp, alone at night.'\n\nWandering away: Beta noticed that Alpha had been wandering away from camp\n\n'I am right here, as I have always been,' Alpha emphasized.\n\nThe next day, her pack saw a satellite explode overhead.\n\nThe distraught sister suddenly saw a walker with a baby carrier, and heard a baby crying.\n\nShe tackled the walker and was torn apart, while her sister shuffled away, after saving Alpha.\n\nSlow moving: Beta walked up front as the group walked with a herd of zombies\n\nUnder attack: Walkers attacked the sister who was distraught about a baby\n\nIn the fight, three people from the group were killed.\n\n'She was an uncommitted,' her sister said afterward. 'She no longer belonged with us.'\n\n'We're strongest when we kill our own blood,' Alpha replied. 'It is the purest, most honest way to bring order to chaos.'\n\nShe was impressed by the woman, telling Beta 'she fears nothing.'\n\nImpressive move: Alpha was impressed that a member of her pack killed her own sister\n\nShe even anointed her Gamma\u2014third in the Greek alphabet after Alpha and Beta.\n\nLater, Beta found Alpha sitting quietly in the woods, holding Lydia's stuffed bunny.\n\nIt hit him that the teenager was alive, and he grew furious with his friend.\n\nNew designation: Gamma, played by Thora Birch, was anointed by Alpha for her fearlessness\n\n'She is never coming back, no matter how much you wish for it, or how hard you try to replace her with someone else,' Beta yelled. 'She is gone, Alpha!'\n\n'She's my baby!' Alpha sobbed. 'I could not kill her.'\n\nBeta held her hand and promised not to tell anyone.\n\n'Lydia's dead to me,' Alpha said. 'She was dead the moment she was born, 'cause she was not like me.'\n\nDead daughter: Alpha insisted that her daughter Lydia was dead to her but sobbed over her absence\n\nShe smashed and kicked at things around her, screaming: 'She was not like me!'\n\nWhen she calmed down, Beta told her he'd seen smoke by their borders.\n\n'The enemy,' Alpha purred. 'We must teach them a lesson. And the pack will watch.'\n\nBeta put her mask on her, smoothed its hair, and touched her palm with his own.\n\nSmoke spotted: Beta spotted smoke by their borders and told Alpha about it\n\n'We walk in darkness, we are free,' the pair said, joining walkers with their group.\n\n'We bathe in blood. We are free. We love nothing. We are free. We fear nothing. We are free. We need no words. We are free. We embrace all death. We are free.'\n\nAlpha slipped off her mask and spoke to the camera.\n\n'This is the end of the world,' she said. 'Now is the end of the world. We are the end of the world.'\n\nShe looked up right where she was standing, and saw Carol Pelletier (Melissa McBride) on a nearby precipice, staring back at her.", "description": "The Whisperers' origins were revealed on Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead that saw leaders Alpha and Beta bond over their love for the dark side.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/08/19680956-0-image-a-54_1571039725898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
