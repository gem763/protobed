Most of my models had white complexions and I didn't realize I was doing this until someone pointed it out,\" she said.\n\nGiraffe manor: Nairobi, Kenya, draws people from around the world. This image shows that one can enjoy the safari and Kenyan tea in lovely places around the country.\n\nAccording to Ouma, she subconsciously picked up illustrating white people from reading magazines that didn't represent people who looked like her.\n\nShe would later decide to make a conscious effort to share stories of women who had the same skin color, and experiences similar to hers.\n\n\"I made up my mind that whenever I put my work out for people to see, I would be intentional about making it reflect some of me,\" she said.\n\nIn 2019, she started publicly sharing stories and sketches of women from different parts of the continent, drawing inspiration from people and places she visits.\n\nIn one of her illustrations, Ouma describes the women in Kericho, a town in Kenya famous for its tea farms.\n\nKericho: Inspired by the tea fields in Kenya.\n\n\"I used to go to the village during the holidays and we'd usually drive by the tea fields in Kericho. It looked so beautiful to me, and there are a lot of women who work on the tea fields,\" she told CNN.\n\nThe illustration references tea as a huge part of Kenyan culture and the women who drink the tea, which is produced by other women on the farms.\n\nOuma says she is also fascinated by fashion from across the continent.\n\nShe started illustrating brands from Africa because she struggled to find African illustrators telling stories about the fashion industry.\n\nA woman enjoying her vacation in Lamu, Kenya. Inspired by Swahili architecture from Lamu.\n\n\"During fashion weeks, you see illustrators from all over the world sharing stories through their work. And you see fashion houses getting their stories told.\n\n\"But when we have our own fashion weeks, I feel like I cannot find enough content about it. People are not using illustrations,\" she said.\n\nYellow cab: Inspired by the debut of fashion brand Maxhosa at the 2019 New York fashion week.\n\nA graduate of fashion design and marketing at the University of Machakos in Kenya, Ouma now recreates designs from brands she finds interesting.\n\nShe says she's interested in re-enacting the work of designers who portray African print and culture in ways that non-Africans can relate to.\n\n\"Sometimes it is not the brand that has reached out to collaborate with me, sometimes I am the one who wants to tell their story,\" she said.\n\nIn 2018, she recreated one of the designs from Cameroon-based fashion brand Maison D'Afie , citing the brand's ability to connect with a much wider audience outside Africa as inspiration.\n\nOuma says the dress references the stylish Sawa tribe from Cameroon's coastal region, and its green colors reflect the rainforest around the area in which the tribe lives.\n\nAn illustration of Maison D'Afie's Bunny Wu dress.\n\n\"I think it is interesting the way they put it in a modern way because they are letting people see Africa in a way that it has never been seen before,\" she said.\n\n\"As much as we appreciate the traditional things for Africa, we want other people to enjoy the culture with us,\" she added.\n\nOuma, who now illustrates full time, says people sometimes underestimate the work she does.\n\n\"One of the challenges has been finding people who see the value in what you do. They think it's the same as paying to use a picture online, they don't understand that illustrations are custom-made for specific stories,\" she said.\n\nChai & Changa: Inspired by Khanga fabrics originating from the coastal area of East Africa. Tea (chai) is big in Kenya and here it is used in celebrating beautiful, dark African skin.\n\nIn the next few years, Ouma wants to be more present in Africa's fashion industry, sketching for her favorite designers from across the continent.\n\n\"Eventually, I will get to designing clothes full time... but I want my illustrations to tell stories so I watch videos and read books about it so that I can become better,\" she said.", "description": "Phoebe Ouma is using illustrations to tell stories of African brands and their designs.", "authors": ["Aisha Salaudeen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022142801-phoebe-ouma-photos-6-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
