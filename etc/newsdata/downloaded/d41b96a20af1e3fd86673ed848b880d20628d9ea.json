But users who were part of the trial started sharing interesting tidbits of what classic material will be a part of the service. And if you\u2019re a fan of old-school Marvel animation, especially that \u201890s golden age, there stands a chance you\u2019ll be very pleased come November:\n\nHere's another screenshot of the Marvel section including some of the animated shows mentioned. pic.twitter.com/UbTKfy7m0n \u2014 GJ Kooijman (@gjkooijman) September 12, 2019\n\nPeople have asked so here's all the pre-2000 Marvel shows I've found:\n\nSpider-Woman (1979), Spider-Man(1981), Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends (1982), X-Men(1992), Iron Man (1994), Fantastic Four (1994), Incredible Hulk (1996), Silver Surfer (1998) and Spider-Man Unlimited ('99) \u2014 GJ Kooijman (@gjkooijman) September 12, 2019\n\nX-Men! Spider-Man! Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends! Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer! Even the Spider-Woman cartoon! There\u2019s some blind spots like the classic \u201860s Spider-Man animated series, arguably better known today as a living, breathing meme rather than it is an animated show, or live-action classics like Toei\u2019s Spider-Man.\n\nAnd it bears repeating that this sample is specific only to the Netherlands right now, so other markets getting Disney+ this year might have a different catalogue of shows \u2014 and on top of that, it might not be a final indicator of what\u2019ll be there day one, and is just a sample to test with.\n\nRegardless of how it pans out, it\u2019s just another string in Disney\u2019s incredibly over-strung bow when it comes to the almost unfathomable amount of content it wants Disney+ to launch with.\n\nA staggering reminder of just what it has access to thanks to the might of billions of dollars and an avaricious appetite for expansion, to boot.\n\nBut at least we\u2019ll be able to watch X-Men?", "description": "As if the approximately seven billion things already announced for Disney\u2019s\u00a0upcoming streaming service weren\u2019t enough, some of Marvel\u2019s animated icons might be about to tempt you to sign up for the studio\u2019s big move into the streaming service market....", "authors": ["Leah Williams", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xfuxzpj5t8ohhiaeorow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
