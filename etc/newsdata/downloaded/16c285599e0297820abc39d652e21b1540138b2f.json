Not so. Over the break, a dozen more Democrats came out in favor, bringing the number to 131, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler said an impeachment inquiry might begin in late fall, after hearings this month and next.\n\nThe pooh-bahs of the House leadership are proceeding cautiously. One of them rightly told me last week that the worst thing they could do would be to lose an impeachment vote. They need a majority of the House\u2014217 Democrats (plus independent Justin Amash)\u2014which means they must gather at least 87 more commitments by the end of the year. There are currently 235 Democrats.\n\nCan they get there? (Any later than early 2020 and it\u2019s too close to the election). The party line is Democratic members will do their duty and look at the evidence, which Trump is fighting furiously in court to withhold. This argument is partly legit (it\u2019s important to build a public case) but mostly window-dressing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the moderates already know that the man obstructed justice, abuses power every day, and is clearly unfit for office.\n\nWhat\u2019s holding them back is a faulty analysis of the politics of impeachment. They\u2019re still caught in the grips of myopic conventional wisdom about the way the whole thing would actually play out in a trial in the Senate.\n\nRecall that in the July 31 debate, Sen. Michael Bennet repeated the familiar argument that the Senate will not remove Trump from office. If the House impeaches him, Bennet said, Trump \u201cwould be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nJulian Castro shot back: \u201cIf they don\u2019t impeach him, he\u2019s going to say, \u2018You see? You see? The Democrats didn\u2019t go after me on impeachment, and you know why? Because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nConversely, Castro continued, if the House impeaches Trump, the public would conclude that \u201chis friend, Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch, let him off the hook.\u201d\n\nCastro\u2019s argument was so persuasive that Bennet did something you never, ever see in a debate\u2014he changed his mind on stage: \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with that. You just said it better than I did. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u2018stain and blame\u2019\n\nWalking and chewing gum at the same time\u2014a useful clich\u00e9\u2014usually means in this context legislating and investigating Trump simultaneously. But it could also mean something else: attacking Trump and McConnell at the same time. It may be that a winning Democratic impeachment strategy is coming into view, one that simultaneously upholds the rule of law and yields political dividends.\n\nI call it \u201cStain and Blame\u201d\u2014stain Trump by impeaching him, and blame McConnell when he is acquitted in the Senate.\n\nThere\u2019s only one modern case of a Senate impeachment trial of a president, and the circumstances differed. But I covered Bill Clinton\u2019s trial for Newsweek in 1999 and the procedure that was followed then is instructive.\n\nThe Clinton trial took place in a Republican-controlled Senate and was presided over by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wore a special robe embroidered with ribbons he adopted from a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. The prosecutors in the case were 12 \u201cHouse Managers\u201d (including then-Rep. Lindsey Graham); the defense was handled by Clinton\u2019s private lawyers\u2014including a brilliant, wheelchair-bound litigator named Charles Ruff\u2014and one Democratic senator, Dale Bumpers.\n\nBecause the evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice contained sexual material, much of it was heard behind closed doors and all three witnesses to the possible obstruction of justice\u2014Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal\u2014 appeared only on videotape. With 67 votes required for conviction, Clinton\u2019s acquittal was\u2014like Trump\u2019s\u2014a foregone conclusion.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s impeachment, while unpopular at the time, was nonetheless a humiliating blow. The next election after the whole process was completed was not the 1998 midterms\u2014won by Democrats before Senate acquittal\u2014but the 2000 presidential election, which George W. Bush (barely) won over Clinton\u2019s vice-president, Al Gore, in part by promising to \u201crestore honor and dignity to the Oval Office.\u201d The argument worked, even though Clinton wasn\u2019t on the ballot. In 2020, after impeaching Trump, it would work much better. Without impeaching him, it has no sting.\n\nThis time, the trial in the well of the Senate would be presided over by Chief Justice John Roberts, who, like Rehnquist, would run it like a quasi-trial, with evidence, witnesses (who would likely appear in person) and summations. Nadler and others from the House Judiciary Committee would serve as prosecutors. Trump would have private lawyers defending him. The senators would be the jury.\n\nIt would be Roberts\u2019 job to make sure the rules are followed, which means the prosecution and defense must stick to the indictment\u2014the articles of impeachment approved by the House. McConnell would not have the 60 votes needed to change those rules or dismiss the motion to consider the articles.\n\nwhat a senate trial would look like\n\nThis necessity of adhering to the articles of impeachment has received no discussion. But it is crucial to understanding how a Senate trial would actually go. Recall Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony. With the exception of Reps. John Ratcliffe and Louie Gohmert, no Republicans tried to claim Trump did not commit obstruction of justice.\n\nInstead, they changed the subject to Fusion GPS, the Steele dossier, and other counter-charges irrelevant to what would be at issue in a Senate trial. Except in the defense\u2019s opening argument and summation, these distractions would likely not be allowed during the bulk of the Senate trial, televised for tens of millions.\n\n\u201c Despite his acquittal, impeachment\u2014a convenient shorthand for all of his despicable qualities\u2014would be wrung around Donald Trump\u2019s neck all the way to Election Day. \u201d\n\nThink about the defense that Trump would be compelled to mount. His trial lawyers would have the unenviable task of shooting down at least eight clear examples of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller Report, plus explain why Trump did not abuse and disgrace his office and obstruct Congress (other likely articles of impeachment). They would have to explain why it was perfectly okay for Trump to feather his own nest by directing his people to stay at Trump hotels, after promising he would not tend to his businesses in the White House. (That article of impeachment could fall under either abuse of power or violation of the emoluments clause).\n\nThe point is, Trump would be flayed every day for the duration of the short trial\u2014hardly helpful to his re-election. Meanwhile, vulnerable Republican incumbents from blue states like Cory Gardner and Susan Collins would face a very tough vote. To save their seats, they might be forced to vote for conviction, which would hurt Trump even more in battleground states.\n\nNow contrast this with what would happen if the House decides not to impeach Trump. Without a trial, the whole thing goes in the rear view mirror, except whenever Trump wants to fling it in the Democrats\u2019 face.\n\nBeyond acquittal in the Senate, the other conventional argument against impeachment made by House moderates in swing districts is that they want to campaign in 2020 as they did in 2018\u2013on real issues that people care about, like health care.\n\nThat would be a good point if Democrats were stressing Trump\u2019s failure to protect people with preexisting conditions\u2014a big issue in the midterms. But that argument received zero attention in the recent presidential debates, which showed that the more Democrats discuss health care, the more divided and impractical they look. And impeachment would hardly prevent Democrats from returning to smart health care arguments after the primaries.\n\nA related piece of conventional wisdom is that impeachment and a Senate trial would open Democrats up to the charge\u2014already being made by the GOP against pro-impeachment House members\u2014that they are not working for their constituents.\n\nBut if the Clinton case is any indication, a week-long Senate trial would wrap up only a month or so after impeachment. That means the whole thing would be over in January or February. The Democrats could shower blame on McConnell for the acquittal and move on. By summer, Democratic members would have had plenty of time to refocus their attention on constituent concerns. No Republican challenger can credibly argue in October of 2020 that the incumbent Democrat ignored constituents for a brief period 10 months earlier while he or she voted for impeachment. People can\u2019t remember what happened two weeks ago, much less 10 months ago.\n\nWith one exception: The impeachment of the President. The memories of that are long. Despite his acquittal, impeachment\u2014a convenient shorthand for all of his despicable qualities\u2014would hang around Donald Trump\u2019s neck all the way to Election Day. And he would be stained forever in history, his just deserts.", "description": "The Senate will acquit the president if the House impeaches him, true. But that\u2019s not a reason not to do it.
