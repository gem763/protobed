That clearly bothered Butler, who scraped his way to the top. It\u2019s easy to see how he\u2019d view Wiggins as having more just handed to him and resent Wiggins for it.\n\nWhen Butler was up for a contract extension with the Bulls, they reportedly told him they\u2019d bury him behind Tony Snell if he didn\u2019t sign. Wiggins\u2019 hurdle for getting a max contract extension? He had to look the owner in the eyes and promise to try really hard.\n\nWiggins\u2019 has regressed since signing his extension, leaving Minnesota with limited flexibility around his massive contract. Butler felt the brunt of that, too.\n\nLast summer, he reportedly requested a renegotiation-and-extension that would\u2019ve added four years and $155 million to his deal. But the Timberwolves didn\u2019t have the cap space to make that happen \u2013 in large part because of Wiggins\u2019 deal.\n\nOf course, Butler knew that. It was unrealistic for Minnesota to trade Wiggins without bringing back salary at that point. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Butler\u2019s renegotiation-and-extension request were designed to create an excuse for a trade request. He might have wanted out for reasons other than just his own contract status.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike the Timberwolves being saddled for years to come by an underachieving Wiggins on a max contract.\n\nButler got away, finding a great fit and a max contract with the Heat. Minnesota is still dealing with the same problem.", "description": "In 2017, Andrew Wiggins signed a five-year, max contract extension with the Timberwolves.
