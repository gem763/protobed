The terms of reference are suitably broad to allow related transactions to be scrutinised.\n\nRetired Australian Federal Court judge John Gilmour, QC, will sit as a \"second commissioner\" alongside chairman Sir Salamo Injia on the inquiry.\n\nPerth barrister Matthew Howard, SC, has been appointed counsel assisting the royal commission, while his junior counsel is fellow West Australian Alexander Mossop.\n\nMr Kramer also said he would investigate any links between controversial Manus Island refugee contractor Paladin and Mr O'Neill.\n\nMr Kramer said one avenue of investigation was any ownership links between Mr O'Neill and security firm Black Swan, which was purchased by Paladin for an undisclosed sum in July last year.\n\n\u201cThat is what I want to establish, to see if there is any clear lead between Black Swan and Peter O\u2019Neill,\" Mr Kramer said.", "description": "An arrest warrant has been issue for Peter O'Neill who was dogged by allegations of corruption during his nearly eight years in power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5666%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_341%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7369b91694e060622ca9080d689ccf695ed9d47c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
