It comes just ten days after a humpback whale died after being hit in the face by a ship. It succumbed to its injuries a few days later\n\nAn image of the whale floating next to docks was posted to Facebook alongside the caption: \u2018A photo sent to me that I am told was taken this morning at Denton, Gravesend, showing an unconfirmed whale that has died.\n\n'Unsure if it has been recovered by the PLA, but the relevant authorities have been made aware.'\n\nMartin Garside, spokesman for the Port of London authority, said: 'You couldn't make it up. It's in no way connected to Hessy the Humpback - it's a complete bizarre coincidence.'\n\nMr Garside added: 'It's not fully grown but it doesn't look to be a baby. It may be a fin whale - it's definitely not a Humpback - but the species and gender are yet to be confirmed.'\n\nHe explained how they managed to put a line around it to secure the mammal and towed it to one of their facilities in the east of Gravesend.\n\n'There had been no live sightings of this whale so the first time anyone was aware was when it was found dead - it may have been dead for some days,' he explained.\n\nLarge fin whales can grow to 68.9ft-long as an adult and are usually found off the Gulf of California, the Coral Triangle, and Arctic.\n\nNext to the blue whale, the fin whale is the second largest mammal in the world.\n\nThe mammal have a distinct ridge along their back behind the dorsal fin, which gives it the nickname \u2018razorback.\u2019\n\nTheir lower right jaw is bright white and the lower left jaw is black and it gets its name from an easy-to-spot fin on its back, near its tail.\n\nIt comes just ten days after a humpback whale died after swimming into the Thames.\n\nThe 27ft-long juvenile female, Hessy, was spotted near Greenhithe sparking international attention.\n\nTen days ago: The 27ft-long juvenile female, nicknamed Hessy, was spotted near Greenhithe, Kent earlier this week, sparking international attention\n\nBut a post-mortem revealed she suffered catastrophic injuries to her jaw and a large wound to her head after a ship strike was the main cause of death.\n\nRob Deaville, of the Zoological Society of London, said the strike is thought to have happened in open sea rather than in the river.\n\nHe added that the post-mortem revealed the animal had not eaten for some time and was 'nutritionally compromised', but no signs of any ingested plastics were found.\n\nRare sightings of the whale had delighted onlookers and whale watchers, who flocked to the banks of the river to catch a glimpse of the elusive animal.\n\nThe mammal, nicknamed Hessy, was spotted several times near Erith Reach, around five miles west of Greenhithe\n\nExperts say it is likely the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up river from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level was at its highest\n\nExperts say it is likely the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up river from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level was at its highest.\n\nAnother humpback whale which entered the the river 10 years ago is known to have died of starvation.\n\nThe exact cause of Hessy's death will be determined following analysis from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme at London Zoo.\n\nHumpback whales are rarely stranded around the UK coast, with just one or two incidents recorded on average each year.\n\nYet it is the fifth humpback whale to be recorded stranded in the UK so far this year.\n\nTwo others recorded in the Thames and wider Thames estuary region in 2009 and 2013 both died.\n\nLast year, Benny the Beluga whale caught the public's attention after he was seen feeding in the Thames. It is thought he finally left the area.\n\n", "description": "The discovery, described as a 'complete bizarre coincidence', comes 10 days after Hessy, the 27-foot mammal, was hit by a ship in open sea before dying in the Thames as a result of her injuries.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali", "Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19882608-0-image-a-27_1571400465115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
