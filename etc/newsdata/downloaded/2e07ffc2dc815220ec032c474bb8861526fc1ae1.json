Overall revenue for the quarter dropped 20% \u2013 less than investors feared. Boeing shares, which have dropped 20% since the Max was grounded in March, rose 3%.\n\nThe drop in profits come as Boeing announced that Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial jetliner division, is leaving the company after just three years at the job.\n\nMcAllister\u2019s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress next week, was stripped of the company\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nMuilenburg\u2019s demotion followed a further hit to Boeing\u2019s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max\u2019s MCAS anti-stall system three years before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 189 and 157 respectively.\n\nThe exchanges contradict Boeing\u2019s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe. In the messages from 2016, simulator pilot Mark Forkner complained MCAS was acting unpredictably. \u201cIt\u2019s running rampant,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, aviation authorities in Indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of Lion Air flight 610 before the release of the final accident report on Friday.\n\nInvestigators from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee in Jakarta said systemic design flaws in the 737 Max were compounded by errors by the plane\u2019s pilots, who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle MCAS malfunctions.", "description": "Aircraft company, which saw 737 Max grounded after fatal crashes, says it will also cut production of 787 Dreamliner jet", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3e6985c57f917215ca3d8926808238a6d3783b/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e658e37fbeb0f66d9aa6dce5b81b66f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
