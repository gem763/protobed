As Bradby noted, the journey took a turn days later when the pair announced their decision to take legal action against British tabloids. Harry opened up about the \"bullying\" against his wife, his reported \"rift\" with his brother, Prince William, and his desire not to see the treatment of his late mother, Princess Diana, extend to Meghan; the new duchess, meanwhile, came face-to-face with the realities of her new role.\n\nHere are the biggest moments:\n\nMeghan on Proudly Identifying as a Woman of Color:\n\nThe former Suits star opened up about her black heritage as she proudly identified as a woman of color during her speech at Cape Town\u2019s Nyanga township.\n\n\"I would hope that people -- the world -- will get to a point where you just see us as a couple who is in love, right? Because I don't wake up every day and identify as being anything other than who I've always been. I'm Meghan and I married this incredible man, and this, to me, is just part of our love story,\" she told Bradby of her decision to open up about her race.\n\n\"But for me, when I made the choice to add those words into the speech, it was really at the last minute, and I said to Harry, 'What do you think if I add this in? I don't know. It just felt right.' And he very kindly and supportively said, 'If that's what feels right, then that's what you should say.' Because it's true,\" Meghan continued. \"Before I was part of this family, that's how I identified, with people and connection, as a mother now, as a wife now ,but just as a woman of color, which has been brought to the forefront in a more prominent way.\"\n\nView photos Pool/Samir Hussein/WireImage More\n\nMeghan on Introducing Archie to Meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu:\n\nThe 5-month-old made an adorable appearance as Meghan and Harry decided to introduce him to Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his daughter, Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe, on day three of their tour.\n\n\"It's not lost on us what a huge and significant moment that is, and I think Archie will look back at that in so many years and understand that right at the beginning of his life, he was fortunate enough to have this moment with one of the best and most impactful leaders of our time,\" Meghan told Bradby. \"So, it was really special.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry on Archie Loving Africa:\n\nAt a dinner in South Africa, Harry gushed about how Archie has embraced their traveling. \"I'll tell you what, he clearly loves Africa as well because he was up looking out the window,\" he said. \"He found his voice now, he's bouncing up and down and making more noise than he's ever made before and he's smiling all the time.\"\n\n\"He was happy before. He's the happiest here the past two days,\" Meghan added.\n\nHarry on Whether He and Meghan Will Move to Africa:\n\nAfrica holds a special place in Harry and Meghan's hearts, but they aren't considering moving there permanently, Harry told Bradby. \"I don't know where we could live in Africa at the moment, we've just come from Cape Town. That would be an amazing place to be able to base ourselves,\" he shared. \"But with all the problems going on there... I don't see how we'd be able to make as big a difference as we want to.\"", "description": "The royal couple took viewers inside their private life on 'Harry & Meghan: An African Journey'", "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X_pxfACY3aMg_yyMnKzPxQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/c886317162f2d4f077dc3804a2bb07e8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
