Sydney, Osaka and Calgary make up the top five on the annual Global Liveability Index of 140 cities around the world, researched by The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nLucie Lamster Thury, a New Yorker who moved to Vienna in 2004 and runs shopping tours of the city, said Vienna \"taught me how to live.\n\n\"Coming from Manhattan it was hard to slow down but I love the pace of Vienna. It's relatively quiet, clean and culturally abundant, and I've never felt safer in Europe or in the States. I thought I'd never get used to shops being closed on Sundays, but it has changed my life -- people actually get to rest here, and private life is as important as work.\"\n\nRelated content The world's most liveable cities in 2018\n\nAlthough the top 10 was dominated by Australia, Canada and Japan, Europe performed well overall. Eight of the top 20 cities are in Northern Europe, with Copenhagen following Vienna into the top 10, and Zurich, Frankfurt and Geneva taking spots 11, 12 and 14.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nHelsinki, Amsterdam and Hamburg also made the top 20, while Berlin and Luxembourg came in at 21 and 23 respectively.\n\nHonolulu was the top ranked US city at 22, with Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Washington, DC in the top 40. Chicago was rated 41st.\n\nLondon and New York ranked 48 and 58 respectively. Both were rated highly for culture but were brought down by their lower scores for infrastructure and stability, with a higher risk of crime and terrorism.\n\nParis' stability rating also took a tumble thanks to the \"gilet jaunes\" anti-government protests. It fell six places from last year's ranking to 26.\n\nRelated content In this bakery, grandmas are the stars\n\nSingapore came in at number 40, and Dubai at 70.
