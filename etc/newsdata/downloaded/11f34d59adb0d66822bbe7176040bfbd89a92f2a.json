Breezes are calm to very light. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: High clouds increase and temperatures do not drop quite as much, with lows in the upper 40s to mid-50s. No weather worries for the big World Series matchup. Confidence: High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSaturday should be mostly dry, but cloudy skies prevail and a few showers could show up by late afternoon or evening, especially in our western areas. Highs run into the mid- to upper 60s. Showers Saturday evening and night could dampen Game 4 of the World Series, but evening rain should be mostly light and spotty before increasing in coverage and intensity overnight into Sunday morning. Lows Saturday night should be in the 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday is challenging for the Marine Corps Marathon, as low pressure passing to our west and north is likely to deliver periods of rain with a bit of a muggy feel as highs reach the upper 60s to low 70s. Rain could be moderate, with downpours possible at times, especially later in the morning into the early afternoon. Showers may linger into the evening but should mostly clear away in time for the possible fifth game of the World Series. Lows Sunday night range in the 50s to low 60s. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nMonday brings clearing with highs in the upper 60s to about 70.
