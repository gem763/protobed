Britain would also have to nominate a member of the European Commission that would serve until the UK leaves the EU \u2014 a clear sign to voters of the persistent failure of Westminster to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote.\n\nFrance, which stood as a possible roadblock to an extension, softened its position over the weekend towards another Brexit delay as President Emmanuel Macron was convinced that elections in the UK would be conducted shortly. By Monday morning it was reported it was \u201cmost likely\u201d France would not stand in the way of a significant delay.\n\nAn EU official told the Financial Times: \u201cIt\u2019s true that France had a fairly tough position, but there is now the perspective of quick British elections, which changes the picture.\u201d\n\nThe news of another extension comes amidst fresh talks over an election in the United Kingdom, as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) have announced that they will push for an election on December 9th under the assumption that a no-deal Brexit would be taken off the table.\n\nLib Dems, SNP Push for December 9th Election to Stop Boris #Brexit Deal Being Passed https://t.co/wfS7dvL6we \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 27, 2019\n\nThe move, if approved by Parliament, would effectively block any consideration of Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, as UK law demands that Parliament be dissolved 25 working days before an election.\n\nThe bill put forward by the Lib Dems and SNP would amend the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, meaning that a call for an election would only require a simple majority. Because the two parties do not have the votes to pass the measure by themselves, the bill would require cross-party support.\n\nConservative Party chair James Cleverly, speaking to the BBC, dubbed the move a \u201cgimmick\u201d and that \u201cif the Liberal Democrats and SNP really want an election, they should vote for the Dec. 12 date proposed by Johnson.\u201d\n\nOthers Conservatives fear that the move is a plot to undermine Johnson and the Conservatives going into an election. A senior Tory told The Times: \u201cAn election without having delivered Brexit helps the Lib Dems and Farage \u2014 our two main opponents. To say it\u2019s risky is an understatement.\u201d\n\nLetter from Boris: an Election on December 12? Johnson Calls for Election\u2026 for Third Time https://t.co/kpkGR8nU6C \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2019\n\nBoris Johnson said last week that he would be asking MPs to vote today on a December 12th election. However, under the rules of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, Johnson would require a two-thirds majority to secure an election.\n\nLabour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, reiterated his stance that the party would not vote for an election until a no-deal Brexit was \u201ccompletely off the table\u201d, and labelled the move by the Liberal Democrats and SNP as a \u201cstunt\u201d.\n\nAccording to The Times, an unnamed source inside Number 10 said on Sunday: \u201cJeremy Corbyn and MPs\u2019 refusal to deliver Brexit is damaging our democracy and causing harm for millions of businesses. Leaving this parliament in place means not just three months more of pointless delay, but potentially further extensions.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow parliament to waste 2020 the way it has wasted 2019. The country wants Brexit done so we can move on. [On Monday] MPs will vote on an election on December 12, so we can get a new parliament.\n\n\u201cIf Labour oppose[s] being held to account by the people yet again then we will look at all options to get Brexit done, including ideas similar to that proposed by other opposition parties.\u201d", "description": "The EU27 is expected to vote on a three-month Brexit extension until January 31, with the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving early.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-3-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
