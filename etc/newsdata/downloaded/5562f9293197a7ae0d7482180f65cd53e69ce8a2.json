Despite this, the game reportedly still reigns on top of the online gaming charts.\n\nFortnite has seen a general decline in revenue since Q2 2018, excluding its best month in December 2018, which saw the holiday season work wonders for the game in terms of in-game content sales. V-Bucks reportedly make up 83 percent of total revenue and the rest of the percentage comes from store bundles and packs.\n\nScreengrab via Edison Trends\n\nIn regards to measuring player loyalty, 49 percent of Fortnite players \u201cmade repeat purchases month over month.\u201d It comes in second when compared to rival Apex Legends, which sees 62 percent of players making repeat purchases.\n\nThe gradual decrease in revenue is natural for a game like Fortnite, though. A decrease in revenue may sound like a warning for the future of the game, but it\u2019s expected to remain at a lower but stable amount of spending in the future.\n\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds spending has continually declined since 2017, but revenue is much more stable with a small drop of only two percent in the same period that Fortnite revenue dropped 52 percent.\n\nThis report comes after increasing complaints from players about controversial in-game decisions, such as the removal of the popular Siphon feature from default playlists, as well as the introduction of B.R.U.T.E. mechs at the beginning of season X.\n\nWhile Fortnite revenue is succumbing to a steady decline, it still reigns much higher than its competitors\u2014just not with as large of a lead as last year.", "description": "The game still reigns over its competitors regardless of the gradual decrease in revenue.", "authors": ["Ben Walker"], "top_image": "https://dotesports-media.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01145658/Fortnite_patch-notes_v10-40-patch-notes_header-v10-40-patch-notes_10BR_TheCombine_NewsHeader-1920x1080-9adcac745cb0a6f66871a3441bfd9456c373a3da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
