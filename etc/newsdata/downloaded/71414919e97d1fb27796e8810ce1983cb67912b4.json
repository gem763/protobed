Back in 2017, with Liam Fox (remember?) as secretary of state for international trade, a joint working party was set up which is \u201claying the groundwork for a potential, future free trade agreement once the UK has left the EU\u201d, as the Office of the US Trade Representative summarises it.\n\nIn the past few weeks, the \u201cfantastic deal\u201d with the US has hardly been mentioned, while the \u201cnew deal\u201d with the EU takes centre-stage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut what then is Johnson\u2019s real post-short-term Brexit agenda? And, more pertinently, what is the post-Brexit agenda of those who have backed him to date \u2013 namely the powerful financial corporate members of the Eurosceptic think tank Open Europe?\n\nJohnson spent (or wasted) most of the summer playing games of prorogation and fantasy Queen\u2019s speeches, and expulsions of his own party\u2019s long-time MPs. He had certainly sounded like a committed no-dealer, an impression reinforced by the absence of serious new proposals. Then came that magical walk in the park with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar and a potential deal suddenly emerged \u2013 in large part because Johnson conceded that there would have to be a form of customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

hand, there are serious-sounding words about maintaining \u201cenvironmental, social and employment standards at the current high levels provided by the existing common standards\u201d.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement (the legally binding text) also commits the parties to try, in good faith, to \u201cnegotiate expeditiously the agreements governing their future relationship referred to in the political declaration\u201d. So on the face of it, the government agrees to try to negotiate terms in any future free trade agreement that at least maintain existing high standards and a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in regulation. But trying to negotiate is not the same as actually negotiating \u2013 we have to wait and see.\n\nOn the other hand, Johnson\u2019s latest EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill gives us a clue as to his true (content-lite) intent.\n\nThere is a long section on \u201cworkers\u2019 rights\u201d which includes requirements on ministers to make statements of \u201cnon-divergence\u201d from EU rights or, where divergence is proposed, \u201ca statement to the effect that the secretary of state is unable to make a statement of non-divergence\u201d.\n\nThe other main change is the deletion of the commitment to \u201cbuild and improve on the single customs territory\u201d then provided for in the withdrawal agreement. There will (if it can be negotiated) be a free trade agreement that simply seeks \u201cambitious customs arrangements\u201d, whatever they may turn out to be. This could mean absolutely anything \u2013 or nothing \u2013 but is presumably seeking to follow broadly the lines of the recent EU-Canada free trade agreement. This eliminates most tariffs on goods, but requires checks and other \u201cbarriers\u201d in place, as standards are not harmonised.\n\nIt is one thing to make vague or withdrawable promises for the sake of getting a deal or a bill through parliament when the numbers are tight, but that is not a long-term strategy. It would not satisfy Brexiteers.\n\nEven more to the point, it seems it would not satisfy the Tory party\u2019s powerful business backers. Their interests lie in the United States or the \u201crest of the world\u201d and, for them, surely the whole purpose of Brexit is to deregulate and slash standards. Open Europe lists many of the UK\u2019s major corporations among its \u201csupporters\u201d, including big names from the international finance sector (HSBC, JPMorgan, Hambros).\n\nAt the very start of the Brexit referendum process, in 2015, OE published a report called \u201cWhat if...? The consequences, challenges and opportunities facing Britain outside EU\u201d.\n\nIt concluded that leaving the EU is likely to lead to the UK being very modestly worse off. However, with a major programme of deregulation, that could be reversed.\n\nOpen Europe put forward a highly controversial \u201cbest case scenario\u201d, in which the UK undertakes a programme of \u201cvery ambitious deregulation of its economy\u201d. While all other forms of Brexit would leave the economy worse off, it argued that the UK would be somewhat better off. However, the programme to achieve this would require the outright scrapping of a substantial number of what OE called \u201cpolitically sensitive regulations\u201d. The biggest obstacle to the think tank\u2019s ambitious deregulation drive was likely to be \u201cdomestic politics\u201d: a major governmental change of heart would be required on matters such as climate change and consumer protection.\n\nTheir report set out the target areas. First target, protection of workers with \u201cadditional savings achieved by cutting the cost of EU-derived health and safety legislation\u201d.\n\nSecond target, the environment and climate change: \u201cThe EU\u2019s environmental and climate change laws come with a substantial cost to the UK economy and this is arguably the area in which a post-Brexit UK government could make the greatest savings ... Under the extremely liberal scenario, we envisage that the UK would go even further and scrap climate change laws entirely, saving \u00a38.5bn.\u201d\n\nOther targets included financial regulation, consumer protection, product standards.\n\nAt the time, OE saw that their \u201cbest case\u201d might not be politically wholly feasible. But were a Conservative government to be returned at the next election, following the recent purges it will surely be well to the right of any we have seen since 1945. What would then be seen as \u201cpolitically feasible\u201d may be very different in a year\u2019s time.\n\nSo while Labour Leave-voting MPs listen to Johnson\u2019s emollient promises about his kindly intentions (he told Labour MP Tracy Brabin \u201cthere can be no regression\u201d on workers\u2019 rights), we should recall the strength of those lobbies for whom the very purpose of Brexit is to strip away, not entrench, rights and protections in the name of competition and a globalised economy.\n\nAnn Pettifor is the director of Policy Research in Macroeconomics (Prime) and author of \u2018The Case for the Green New Deal\u2019", "description": "It seems longer, but it was only two months ago when, at the G7 in Biarritz, Boris Johnson pledged a \u201cfantastic deal\u201d with Donald Trump\u2019s USA \u201conce we clear up some of the obstacles in our path\u201d.", "authors": ["Ann Pettifor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/19/Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
