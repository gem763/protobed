The movement\u2019s advocates are framing the legal and public debate about gun violence in much the same way as that surrounding the opioid problem \u2013 as an \u201cepidemic.\u201d The strategy is the same \u2013 driven by fear, not facts.\n\nHeadlines designed not to educate but rather to stoke emotions are the norm. Language and semantics are employed with little if any regard to accuracy, but with every intent to elicit the public\u2019s fear.\n\nFactually, for example, firearm violence is down. Millions of AR-15 style rifles are owned and used safely by millions of law-abiding citizens regularly. Fully automatic firearms still are unlawful except in the hands of the military, law enforcement, or the very few individuals specifically licensed by the federal government to possess them.\n\nRegardless of facts such as these, however, the media and Democrat presidential candidates continue to scream that \u201cweapons of war\u201d like the semi-automatic AR-15 rifle -- claimed by them to have been designed for the \u201csole purpose of killing as many people as possible as quickly as possible\u201d -- are everywhere and must be banished from every home and business in the country. With histrionics like these, it is no wonder politicians and even judges look to every possible way to \u201cdo something\u201d; even if it means using laws on the books for purposes never so intended.\n\nPublic nuisance laws are by no means a new arrow in the quiver of gun control advocates. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg used New York\u2019s public nuisance law in the early 2000s to go after firearms retailers in states as far removed from the Big Apple as Georgia. His overall plan fizzled, but he did succeed in putting several small firearms stores out of business because their owners could not afford the legal fees needed to defend against his abusive lawsuits. The current New York state government is employing the same public nuisance strategy, among others, in a drive to put the NRA (which is chartered as a non-profit entity in the state) out of business.\n\nNever a Party to be deterred in its drive to limit individual liberty guaranteed by the Second Amendment, Democrats are pulling every trick out of the bag this election cycle. Calls for \u201cred flag\u201d laws, AR-15 \u201cbuy-back\u201d mandates, and \u201cuniversal\u201d background checks, vie with calls for \u201cimpeachment\u201d for top billing at Democrat town halls and debates.\n\nThe fact that each of these (and other) proposals contain provisions that violate various parts of our Constitution, appears of little import when balanced against the overarching need to \u201cdo something.\u201d Just as long-standing legal principles must give way in the face of cries to \u201cdo something\u201d to address the \u201copioid crisis,\u201d so too must \u201coutdated\u201d notions of gun ownership succumb to the 21st Century \u201ccrisis\u201d of gun violence.\n\nThe notion that whatever \u201ccrisis\u201d is declared at any given time by government or by those seeking to become part of the government, justifies whatever means are deemed necessary to overcome it, is by no means limited to the crusades against opioids and guns.\n\nJust last week, for example, in the name of fighting international terrorism, the federal government demanded that Apple and Google turn over names and other identifying information on thousands of individuals who downloaded an app designed to improve the performance of a particular rifle scope. Neither the companies that developed the app or manufactured the scope, nor any individuals who downloaded it, are suspected of having committed any crimes that would provide the basis required under federal law or the Fourth Amendment for such broad inquiry by the government.\n\nApparently, however, the simple assertion by the government that it needs this trove of information in order to pursue an investigation of users in other countries in possible violation of federal export laws, is deemed by the Justice Department to be sufficient basis on which to make such a privacy-invasive demand.\n\nIn a time that seems so very long ago, our courts would step in and protect against constitutional, legal and policy overreaches such as these. Sadly, however, that safety valve can no longer be assumed to be there.", "description": "The \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d legal theory cited recently by an Oklahoma .09/11/2019 3:24:22AM EST.", "authors": ["Bob Barr", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/307/7ac301e9-5b7f-481f-b9b2-60b9eb8c4713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
