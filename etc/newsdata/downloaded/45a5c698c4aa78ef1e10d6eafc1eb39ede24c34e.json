Burrell believes Markle's emotional state is impacting Harry, particularly because of what happened to Diana.\n\n\"His heart was broken when his mother died, as was William's, and he's never really recovered from that,\" Burrell said.\n\nHarry was 12 when his mother died.\n\n\n\nMarkle and Harry are both currently suing British publications\n\nThe duke and duchess have both recently filed lawsuits against UK-based tabloids.\n\nMeghan is suing Associated Newspapers and claiming misuse of private information, infringement of copyright, and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. The lawsuit specifically refers to the publication of a private letter Meghan wrote to her father.\n\nHarry has filed a separate lawsuit against the owners of The Sun and The Daily Mirror for alleged phone hacking. The case is believed to be related to incidents from the early 2000s.\n\nBurrell thinks the lawsuits are Harry's attempt to prevent history from repeating itself. \"He doesn't want to go through that again,\" Burrell said, referencing Diana's death.\n\nHe believes Harry is effectively telling the media \"Don't you dare do what you did to my mother to my wife.\"\n\n\n\nBurrell is also suing a British tabloid for alleged phone hacking\n\nBurrell recently filed a lawsuit against The Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking, according to The Guardian, one of the publication's Harry is also suing.\n\n\"Before the princess's death and after, I had a mobile phone,\" Burrell told Insider. \"I don't have one today. And that's because the media were hacking my mobile phone, alongside Harry's.\"\n\nBurrell was unable to specify the details of his allegations because the lawsuit is ongoing, but he believes his phone was hacked because of his close relationship with Diana.\n\nSpeaking of the media, Burrell said, \"If they wanted to know a story about Diana, where would they go? Who was the closest source? Well, her son, and her closest confidant, of course, would be targets.\"\n\n\n\nHe also said Diana warned him about phone hacking before her death, though he and others brushed her claims off as \"nonsense\" at the time.\n\nBurrell is featured in an upcoming documentary about Diana's relationship with her stepmother, Raine Spencer\n\nThe documentary, \"Princess Diana's 'Wicked' Stepmother,\" will air on the Smithsonian Channel on October 28, and it explores the tumultuous relationship between the princess and Raine.\n\nBurrell is featured in the documentary, speaking on the duo's reconciliation, which he witnessed while in service as Diana's butler.\n\nBurrell served as Queen Elizabeth II's footman before entering Diana's service. He worked for her until her death, and they were also good friends. He thinks of himself as Diana's \"jack of all trades.\"\n\nBurrell wrote a memoir about his 10 years of service to the princess called \"A Royal Duty\" in 2003.\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry were upset about the book at the time, releasing a statement condemning its publication: \"We cannot believe that Paul, who was entrusted with so much, could abuse his position in such a cold and overt betrayal.
