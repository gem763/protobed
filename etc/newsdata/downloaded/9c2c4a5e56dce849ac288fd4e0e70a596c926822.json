It was long \u2014 three hours that sometimes felt much longer \u2014 and absurdly crowded, with 12 candidates onstage, a record for a televised presidential debate.\n\nBut it was also arguably the most useful debate so far. It was unusually policy heavy, with spirited and detailed debates over automation and employment, the consequences of US withdrawal from Syria, wealth taxation, and more. It saw direct confrontation between candidates who had not previously squared off, like Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard, or Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar, or Beto O\u2019Rourke and Elizabeth Warren. And in the process it sharpened distinctions between the campaigns on issues where their platforms were blurry going in.\n\nHere\u2019s who ended the night better off and who ended it worse off.\n\nBernie entered this debate on the ropes. After spending most of the campaign solidly in second place behind Joe Biden in national polls, he is now a distant third behind Biden and Elizabeth Warren. He\u2019s also in third in Iowa (which he nearly won in 2016) and in New Hampshire (which he won in 2016 in a huge landslide). By the numbers, he seems to be underperforming his last run, despite having a vastly more professional campaign infrastructure and not facing a juggernaut like Hillary Clinton.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, his biggest liability \u2014 being 78 years old, 79 by the time he\u2019d be inaugurated \u2014 came into sharper relief when he was hospitalized following a heart attack and had emergency surgery. It feels gross to hold someone\u2019s health issues against them and I\u2019m extremely glad that Bernie appears in good health now. That said, being president is an uncommonly demanding job and it\u2019s reasonable for voters to wonder if a 78-year-old is up to it.\n\nSanders\u2019s performance Tuesday night provided an answer to that worry. He was more animated and on his game than much younger candidates like Tulsi Gabbard or Amy Klobuchar. He was more effective than Warren at defending the Medicare-for-all plan they both support (but which, he\u2019s quick to note, he wrote), replying to concerns about its realism, \u201cI\u2019m tired of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel. 87 million uninsured. 30,000 people dying every year. 500,000 people going bankrupt. For one reason: They came down with cancer.\u201d\n\nThat answer is not fully accurate \u2014 the uninsured (actually \u201cuninsured plus underinsured\u201d) and death numbers are roughly right, but the bankruptcy numbers aren\u2019t just due to cancer \u2014 but it was powerfully made. Even more powerful was his off-handed, \u201cI feel great!\u201d two hours in, prompting Erin Burnett to ask how he\u2019d reassure voters who worry about his age. Just watch my next rally, Bernie replied.\n\nThe rally might be persuasive, but he might not even need it. Bernie gave a commanding, memorable performance that might have been enough to neutralize the health issue going forward.\n\n\u2014 Dylan Matthews\n\nIf there was any lingering doubt that Warren has ascended to frontrunner status, this debate put it to rest.\n\nWarren was certainly treated like the frontrunner of the debate, judging by all the attacks she took. The Massachusetts senator has replaced Bernie Sanders as the preferred punching bag of lower-polling moderate candidates who are hesitant to go after Biden. From the get-go, more moderate candidates including Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg jabbed at Warren, trying to pin her on whether she\u2019d raise taxes in paying for Medicare-for-all.\n\nLater, Warren squared off against Sen. Kamala Harris, who wanted her to join Harris\u2019s demand that Twitter deactivate Trump\u2019s profile (Warren replied, \u201cNo,\u201d and talked about breaking up big tech companies instead). There were also a couple weird moments with Tulsi Gabbard, who challenged the Massachusetts senator to adopt her pro-Assad and \u201canti-regime change war\u201d stance in Syria, and confronted Warren on her commander-in-chief bona fides before the moderators cut to commercial.\n\nIn past debates, Warren has largely emerged unscathed while Biden was swarmed by the others. Tuesday night was different; at one point, Sen. Cory Booker rushed to Biden\u2019s defense and blasted CNN\u2019s moderators for asking Biden a question about his son\u2019s business ties in Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks shifting from Biden to Warren was a telling realignment \u2014 and signals a new political reality.\n\n\u2014 Ella Nilsen\n\nPete Buttigieg emerged on Tuesday night as the marquee candidate of the centrist Democratic party, and he did so by emulating a political move from an unlikely model: Bernie Sanders.\n\nA great fun fact about Pete Buttigieg is that he once won a \u201cProfiles in Courage\u201d essay contest in high school with a piece celebrating his political hero: Sanders. And while the two are clearly running in different lanes in 2020, they have gone through a similar experience as candidates. Sanders began 2016 as a protest candidate, only partway through realizing that he could actually, truly win the whole shebang. He had to pivot from being a gadfly to a plausible nominee.\n\nSo too with Buttigieg, who probably knew when he entered the race that \u201cmayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana\u201d is not a traditional qualification for the presidency. He began by doing interviews with anyone who asked and proposing flashy ideas like court-packing, and before he knew it he was out-fundraising the former vice president. He had to make the same pivot as his erstwhile hero, from longshot to serious contender.\n\nAnd this is an especially critical moment for that transition, as Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Joe Biden as frontrunner, who appears to be fading. That leaves a huge opening for a center-left candidate who opposes Medicare-for-all and avoids clear class conflict language (and gets the big donor support that comes with that) to take Biden\u2019s place and emerge as the primary alternative to Warren (and, to a lesser degree, Bernie Sanders).\n\nHe\u2019s running as an Indiana pragmatist, not the heir to Sanders\u2019s legacy his teenage self would\u2019ve been excited about. And while this surely annoys Beto O\u2019Rourke and Amy Klobuchar, he is the candidate in that lane with the most fundraising prowess and the most plausible path to the nomination in the polling (especially in Iowa, where he\u2019s in fourth, but not that far down from first). If Biden fades out, Buttigieg stands to take his place.\n\nButtigieg used Tuesday night to make an argument for himself in that role. He attacked Warren on Medicare-for-all. He decried Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun control platform as unrealistic. He also decried Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s approach to Syria, not because she\u2019s de facto pro-Assad but because he thinks \u201cAmerican leadership,\u201d by force if necessary, is important. In fact, it\u2019s hard to identify a time this evening he made an identifiable argument from the left.\n\nAnd yet he convened the centrist rally with focus and verve, and the effort seemed to win the in-person audience over. It probably won\u2019t be enough to win him the nomination. But it might be enough to displace Biden.\n\n\u2014 Dylan Matthews\n\nWinner: opioid epidemic activists\n\nBefore Tuesday, we had gone through three debates with no substantial mention of the opioid epidemic. That changed tonight, when the moderators asked multiple candidates about what they would do about the crisis.\n\nIt certainly wasn\u2019t perfect. The candidates mostly focused on cracking down on pharmaceutical companies for their role in causing the opioid epidemic, with Harris and Castro calling for locking up pharmaceutical executives \u2014 a grabby way to talk about the issue, but one that sidesteps the other serious discussions we need.\n\nI would\u2019ve, for one, preferred a more substantive conversation about the dire state of addiction treatment. This is a big part of the problem: Treatment is both inaccessible, with just one in 10 people with a drug use disorder getting specialty care, and often of poor quality, failing to follow evidence-based practices like offering medications for addiction. (For more on this, follow Vox\u2019s Rehab Racket project.)\n\nBut given the issue\u2019s absence in previous debates, it is good the opioid epidemic got some attention on the national debate stage.\n\nIn 2017, America hit a new record for annual drug overdose deaths at 70,000 \u2014 a figure so high it contributed to the third year in a row of declining or stagnating life expectancy. (Some preliminary data suggest that 2018 was a bit better, with a 5 percent decline in drug overdose deaths. But that would still make 2018 the second-worst year of all time for drug overdose deaths.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, however, has not done much on this issue. He\u2019s committed only a few billion dollars here and there in additional funding, which is far from the tens of billions experts say is needed. And the bulk of his focus has been on policy proposals \u2014 like executing drug traffickers or building a wall \u2014 that most experts say would do nothing to combat the epidemic.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have promised to do better, putting out a range of plans to that end. And on Tuesday, they finally got to talk about those plans to a national audience.\n\n\u2014 German Lopez\n\nWinner: universal basic income\n\nIf Andrew Yang decided to run for president in order to promote universal basic income \u2014 the idea that the government should dispense a guaranteed, regular stipend to every single citizen \u2014 then he\u2019s already won.\n\nHis campaign, whose version of a UBI is called a \u201cfreedom dividend,\u201d has already elevated the idea in our policy discourse. On Tuesday night, UBI got an unusual amount of attention on the debate stage.\n\nYang \u2014 who\u2019s long said that if he becomes president, the government will send a check for $1,000 per month ($12,000 annually) to every American adult \u2014 argued that we need a UBI because of impending automation-induced job loss. But he also said we need it because it\u2019ll recognize the value of caregiving work, \u201cthe work of people like my wife, who\u2019s at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic.\u201d\n\nWe have a Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month, it actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition. ... When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy \u2014 from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do.\n\nHe cleverly framed his proposal as a \u201cpositive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\u201d a term for the ways AI, robotics, and emerging technologies are changing life and work. And he emphasized that he\u2019d be putting money directly into the hands of individual Americans so people can do with it whatever they think is best.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Juli\u00e1n Castro touched on the idea: \u201cI believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I\u2019m even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that will work.\u201d And Tulsi Gabbard embraced it as well. \u201cI agree with my friend Andrew Yang,\u201d she said. \u201cI think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.\u201d\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s debate, Yang built on his surprise reveal during the September debate, when he announced that he\u2019ll give away $1,000 a month for a year \u2014 no strings attached \u2014 to 10 randomly selected families who go to his website and put their names down. Regardless of where his campaign ends up, he\u2019s already given the idea its widest exposure.\n\n\u2014 Sigal Samuel\n\nThe congresswoman from Hawaii has premised her entire candidacy on fierce opposition to US military adventurism abroad. Tonight, she had a chance to distinguish herself during a lengthy foreign policy debate \u2014 and made a series of blatantly false statements.\n\nFirst, she described the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria, which is controlled by America\u2019s Kurdish allies, thusly: \u201cthe slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we\u2019ve been waging in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe US is not waging a war of regime change in Syria (as Biden pointed out later in the debate). American troops are in northern Syria assisting Kurdish forces in combating the ISIS presence in the country. The reason Turkey invaded the Kurdish-held territory is that it sees the Kurds as terrorists and doesn\u2019t want them to have a quasi-state on its border. And it was able to launch the invasion because President Donald Trump pulled out US troops.\n\nBut Gabbard\u2019s comment wasn\u2019t a one-off error. Again and again, Gabbard called for an end to the \u201cregime war in Syria,\u201d which is simply not what\u2019s happening there. She bizarrely blamed the \u201cregime change war\u201d for the Syrian refugee crisis, instead of the murderous regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which has indiscriminately attacked populated areas.\n\nWhen Buttigieg challenged her shaky analysis, saying that \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal,\u201d she accused him of supporting \u201cendless war.\u201d His response was succinct and devastating: \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Zack Beauchamp\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign is not going as planned. He entered the race with a lot of confidence, consistently polling as the frontrunner. Over the last few weeks, that\u2019s started to change \u2014 with several polls putting Elizabeth Warren ahead, and polling averages by RealClearPolitics and the Economist at times putting Biden in second place overall.\n\nTuesday night was Biden\u2019s opportunity to stop the bleeding. That didn\u2019t really happen.\n\nFirst, Biden whiffed an answer that he should have been prepared for. Early on, moderator Anderson Cooper asked Biden about why it was okay for his son, Hunter, to be on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while Biden was vice president, influencing policy in Ukraine.\n\nBiden responded, \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nThe answer missed the point. While there\u2019s no evidence that Biden\u2019s son did anything illegal, there\u2019s still something a bit unsettling \u2014 even corrupt \u2014 about Biden\u2019s son likely benefiting from his family name and maybe even his father\u2019s policymaking. As Matt Yglesias put it, \u201cThat this kind of sleazy stuff has been going on for years doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s abuses of power okay, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make his stepped-up and more-egregious forms of corruption okay. But Democrats are kidding themselves if they don\u2019t think it helps explain why Trump\u2019s corruption is tolerated.\u201d\n\nAfter this moment, you could be forgiven for forgetting that Biden was even on the stage. This was a debate with unusually substantive moments \u2014 about health care, foreign policy, universal basic income, a wealth tax, and much more.\n\nBut Biden didn\u2019t distinguish himself in any of these discussions. He made gaffes \u2014 like when he said he \u201cwould not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops in Iraq,\u201d seemingly meaning Syria. And his other answers were frequently rambling and hard to follow, creating room for rivals like Buttigieg to step up.\n\n\u2014 German Lopez\n\nLoser: free trade\n\nStarting a trade war with China is perhaps the most distinctive and well-known part of Donald Trump\u2019s economic policy. It\u2019s also extremely unpopular: Multiple polls show that American support for free trade has hit all-time highs, most likely a backlash to the harm caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other major global economies.\n\nDemocrats could run against that record, as defenders of free trade who would return to the global economy to the status quo ex ante. But that doesn\u2019t seem like a popular play in today\u2019s Democratic party. Seeming-frontrunner Warren, who talked about the issue the most, described America\u2019s trade agreements as job-killing giveaways to greedy, unpatriotic corporations:\n\nThe data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs. The reason is bad trade policy. The reason has been a bunch of giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade. Giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.\n\nWarren\u2019s rhetoric here would hardly be out of place in a Trump speech. And while she approaches the issue with far more nuance than the president does, her campaign\u2019s aggressive trade policy clearly illustrates a shift in the Democratic Party\u2019s trade politics.\n\nIndeed, Warren\u2019s trade skepticism wasn\u2019t met with any pushback from other Democrats onstage. The party whose last two presidents pushed NAFTA and the TPP is going in a very different direction, a sign that what was once a bipartisan consensus on the benefits of free trade has thoroughly collapsed.\n\n\u2014 Zack Beauchamp", "description": "Winner: Bernie Sanders.
