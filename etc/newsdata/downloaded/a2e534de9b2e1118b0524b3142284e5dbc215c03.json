Thomas had booked her turn to swim the English Channel before her diagnosis and has been pushing towards the marathon swim since her first round of chemotherapy.\n\nThomas admitted she was scared before the marathon swim. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this swim for over two years now and have fought so hard to get here,\u201d she said in a Facebook post. \u201cAm I 100%? No. But I\u2019m the best that I can be right now, with what I\u2019ve been through, with more fire and fight than ever.\u201d\n\nThe swim was supposed to be around 80 miles in length, but because of the strong tides, Thomas ended up swimming closer to 130 miles.\n\nThe ultra marathon swimmer dedicated her historic achievement to fellow survivors of breast cancer. \u201cThis is for those of us who have prayed for out lives, who have wondered with despair about what comes next, and have battled through pain and fear to overcome,\u201d she said in a Facebook post.\n\nThomas completed her first open-water event, the Horsetooth 10K in Colorado, in 2007. In 2016, she swam non-stop for a distance record of 80 miles in 56 hours across Lake Powell in the US.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "An American cancer survivor made history today after becoming the first person to swim the English Channel four times non-stop.", "authors": ["Rachael Bunyan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/sarah-thomas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
