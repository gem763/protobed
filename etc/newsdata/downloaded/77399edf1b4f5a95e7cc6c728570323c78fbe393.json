And I want all of that!\"\n\nCollins had plenty to say in response to Peppers when speaking with the media:\n\nPeppers had scored a pick-six in the third quarter off Washington rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins to help give the Giants a 24-3 lead:\n\nPeppers did so while wearing the No. 21 jersey Collins used to sport for the Giants.\n\nCollins signed with Washington in March on a six-year, $84 million deal after spending 2015-18 in New York, and the 25-year-old All-Pro said in May that it wasn't an easy exit, per NJ.com's Ryan Dunleavy:\n\n\"I'm starting a new chapter and I'm on a good team. When I left the Giants, I was kind of heartbroken. I loved the Giants. When I started there, I wanted to finish there. I wanted to be one of those guys to finish his career on one team. They didn't give me the opportunity to do that. It's a business. I can't do anything about that.\"\n\nCollins also disclosed that New York \"never made an offer.\"\n\nInstead, the Giants filled the safety position through the blockbuster trade that sent receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns. Peppers was part of Big Blue's return.\n\nCollins' emotions are understandable given he was playing the team that labeled him expendable, at MetLife Stadium, while the player who replaced him notched his first career pick-six. To top it off, Washington is 0-4 for the first time since 2001.\n\nLike Peppers reportedly said, the teams will see each other again this season. But tempers will have time to settle as their second and final matchup isn't until Dec. 22 at FedExField.", "description": "The  New York Giants ' 24-3 win over  Washington  on Sunday afternoon was never a tight contest, but Washington safety  Landon Collins  and New York safety Jabrill Peppers got too close for comfort after the game...", "authors": ["Megan Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/666/hi-res-2b251395b549c9392b45b458d6c66d0f_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
