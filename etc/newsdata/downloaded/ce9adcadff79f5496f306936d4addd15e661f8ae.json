But what happens at the next stage, when the threat need not be imminent but the burden of proof is heavier? In Maryland, when a hearing was actually held (in some cases the petitioners did not show up), judges granted final ERPOs 62 percent of the time. In Florida, according to data from the Office of the State Courts Administrator, 1,482 hearings had been held as of March 31 and 1,409 orders had been granted, which translates into an approval rate of 95 percent.\n\nAlthough the standard of proof in Florida is the same as in Maryland (clear and convincing evidence), Florida\u2019s law allows petitions only by law enforcement officers or agencies, which judges apparently find more credible than the reports of possibly aggrieved (or sincerely mistaken) spouses, dating partners, cohabitants, in-laws, or blood relatives, who accounted for most of the applications in Maryland. But that trust can be misplaced.\n\nConsider Chris Velasquez, a University of Central Florida (UCF) student who owned no firearms, had no history of violence, and had never threatened anyone, but who nevertheless was an early target of his state\u2019s red flag law because he said some stupid things on Reddit. In a thread titled \u201cYou guys are too weak to be a school shooter,\u201d Velasquez replied, \u201cMaybe for now but not forever.\u201d Later, he posted \u201cRIP Paddock my hero\u201d in a thread about the autopsy of Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock and wrote \u201cCruz is a hero!\u201d in reference to Nikolas Cruz, perpetrator of the Parkland massacre.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jacob Sullum", "Reason.Com States-Are-Depriving-Innocent-People-Of-Their-Second-Amendment-Rights"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
