Lille played very attacking and gave us a lot of space for counter attacks,\u201d he told reporters afterwards.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you need players to move up quickly towards their goal, but we did it too quickly at times. We discussed beforehand that we might need to put the brakes on a bit so as not to lose possession again and get caught out.\n\n\u201cThat almost happened to us in the last minute of the first half and would have spoilt our half-time lead.\u201d\n\nCriticism was echoed by midfielder Hakim Ziyech, who told Dutch TV there was too much showing off at times from the youthful outfit, seeking to emulate their heroics of last season when they went from the early preliminary rounds right through to the semifinals.\n\n\u201cWe did our thing, but sometimes we overdid it and at times there was too much circus,\u201d he said, referring to cute passing moves and attempted backheels that did not work out for Ajax.\n\nBut Ten Hag described the overall result as \u201cfantastic\u201d.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of good things in our attacking play. The second goal from Edson Alvarez, for example, was well set-up,\u201d added the coach.\n\nThe Mexican scored early in the second half, his goal sandwiched between Quincy Promes\u2019 18th minute effort and the third from Nicolas Tagliafico.\n\nAjax\u2019s next Champions League tie is at Valencia on Oct. 2. Valencia began their campaign with a 1-0 away win over Chelsea on Tuesday.", "description": "Ajax Amsterdam might have made an emphatic start to their Champions League group campaign by blitzing Lille 3-0 on Tuesday, but coach Erik ten Hag was far from pleased with some aspects of their play.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431159868&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0L3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
