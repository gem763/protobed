She\u2019s a child and that\u2019s what she should be. You\u2019re stealing her youth!\u201d lamented another.\n\n\u201cThat poor baby. All she wanted to be for Halloween was Elsa [from Frozen],\u201d someone else wrote.\n\nOne user went so far as to state, \u201cAm I the only one that thinks this is abuse?\u201d\n\nKylie (22) ignored the haters. \u201cMy baby!!!!!!!! I can\u2019t handle this!!!!\u201d she captioned the picture, adding a string of heart emojis.\n\nShe also posted footage on Snapchat of herself dressed as Madonna at the 2003 VMAs when she famously kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
