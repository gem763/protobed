These would prevent cases where agreements expire mid-project and workers then use protected industrial action to apply maximum pressure to employers to improve wages and conditions.\n\nMid project expiry became a hot issue during the resources boom with the construction of billion-dollar LNG projects.", "description": "A government push to introduce lifetime workplace agreements for greenfields projects would most likely involve unions and employers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2523%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_45%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8aef154aa41e273ebfa784017d5ece421c817734", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
