For motor, the difference was 1%\n\nThe FCA say that most firms, when setting a price, include their expectations of whether a customer will switch or pay an increased price \u2013 but this is not made clear to the customer.\n\nThe watchdog found that 55% of consumers in home and 57% in motor can be classified as someone who 'may not be aware of the competitiveness of the product they own, given current pricing practices'.\n\nThis was due to the person giving two or more answers to the survey that indicated they 'lack awareness about how pricing works in the particular market'.\n\nFor home, these consumers were paying 6% higher margins than those not in this category. For motor, margins were 1% higher for these consumers compared to those not in this category.\n\nPotential remedies considered by the FCA The FCA is considering whether firms should publish information about price differentials between their customers The Financial Conduct Authority is considering several remedies to address the issue of consumers overpaying for their insurance. These include: Banning or restricting the practice of raising prices for consumers who renew year on year\n\nRequiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals\n\nRestricting the way that firms use automatic renewal\n\nForcing firms to be 'clear and transparent in their dealings with consumers' The FCA also said it is considering whether firms should publish information about price differentials between their customers.\n\nThe watchdog is considering remedies to improve competition, which could include banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew year on year or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals.\n\nOther potential remedies under consideration include restricting the way that firms use automatic renewal, which could discourage switching.\n\nThe FCA is also considering whether firms should publish information about price differentials between their customers.\n\nChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: 'This market is not working well for all consumers.\n\n'While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers.\n\n'We have set out a package of potential remedies to ensure these markets are truly competitive and address the problems we have uncovered. We expect the industry to work with us as we do so.'\n\nThe regulator intends to publish a final report and consultation on remedies in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThe regulator said it will continue its work to ensure firms improve the oversight of their pricing practices.\n\nGillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Last year we submitted a super-complaint showing loyal customers are being penalised hundreds of millions of pounds a year on their home insurance alone.\n\n'It's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working for consumers and pledging to crack down on the loyalty penalty.\n\nAround six million insurance policyholders pay high prices and are not getting a good deal, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (stock image)\n\n'We're especially happy to hear the regulator say that everything is on the table to make sure customers are getting a fair deal. This includes tackling gradual year-on-year price increases and making companies automatically switch their customers to better deals.\n\n'At the moment these are just proposals. The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised.'\n\nHow to avoid overpaying Citizens Advice said customers should keep an eye out for 'auto renewals' when taking out insurance policies, as you 'might not always get the best price'. Organisation is key - and taking note of when your contracts expire will set customers in good stead. Contact your provider to see if they can offer you a better deal is also recommended, as is shopping around to see if you can get a better price elsewhere.\n\nAssociation of British Insurers (ABI) director-general Huw Evans said: 'We welcome today's report from the FCA, and the industry will continue to work constructively with the regulator to ensure that the market works better for customers.\n\n'It is important that any unintended consequences are carefully considered to ensure that a fair and balanced approach is achieved for all customers.\n\n'Millions of insurance customers get extremely good deals by shopping around regularly, but we agree that the household and motor insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal.\n\n'This is not an issue unique to insurance, but we are the only sector to have taken voluntary steps to address the issue and these are bearing fruit already.'\n\nGareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?, said: 'It is right that the regulator is proposing solutions to stop these sharp pricing practices.\n\n'Our research has found existing insurance customers can be left paying hundreds of pounds more than new customers as a result of complex and opaque pricing systems.\n\n'The regulator must now ensure these proposals are brought in swiftly, and that it is ready to take strong action against firms that continue to rip off consumers simply for staying with their providers.'", "description": "The FCA found that UK customers less aware of market competitiveness were more likely to pay higher margins.
