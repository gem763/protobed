Katie Hill, a California freshman, said she believes talk of impeachment could hurt Democrats on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI do think there need to be questions asked about why the FBI had this information and it wasn\u2019t shared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say also that this is one of the most divisive things that happened during the course of the campaign. As a sexual assault survivor, I really could not understand why it was so divisive. \u2026 I\u2019m in one of the more liberal leaning swing districts, and still my poll numbers just dropped dramatically because I was so outspoken against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what we believe, fervently, to the bottom of our souls, on whether he should be there or not, I know that this is not the issue that we want to be talking about just in terms of election,\u201d she added. \u201cI would like us to be able to just do what\u2019s right, but I know that for many of my colleagues, it\u2019s a really, really tough one.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Pelosi-Dems-Kavanaugh-Impeach Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
