One of the attacks fatally wounded a Ukrainian soldier.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces of the Russian Federation and its mercenaries violated the ceasefire 41 times on October 3. During an enemy attack in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) area, a soldier received a wound incompatible with life,\u201d said a Friday morning statement from the JFO.\n\n\u201cSince midnight, Russia-led forces have opened fire on Ukrainian positions three times near Pavlopil, Zaitseve, and Krymske, using 82mm mortars, cannons installed on infantry fighting vehicles, and rifles,\u201d the JFO said, noting that the heavier weapons are \u201cproscribed under the Minsk agreements,\u201d ostensibly accepted by Moscow as the roadmap to peace in the region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed this week to hold elections in eastern Donbas and grant special legal status to the separatist-controlled region if Russia removes all military forces from the area, a major concession ostensibly welcomed by Moscow.\n\nThe offer was made at considerable political risk to Zelensky, who faces internal criticism for giving too much away to the untrustworthy Russians and their separatist allies.\n\nOne of the candidates Zelensky defeated for the presidency, Yulia Tymoshenko, said on Thursday that Zelensky\u2019s offer of elections and some form of autonomy for eastern Donbas was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and posed \u201ca direct threat to our country\u2019s national security, territorial integrity, and sovereignty.\u201d\n\nZelensky\u2019s other defeated opponent, former President Petro Poroshenko, derided the proposal as \u201cPutin\u2019s formula,\u201d a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Poroshenko said Zelensky risked legitimizing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and occupation of Donbas, which would become \u201can anchor blocking Ukraine\u2019s aspirations\u201d to join the European Union.\n\nA substantial protest was held in Kyiv against Zelensky\u2019s plan on Tuesday, with hundreds of demonstrators chanting \u201cNo to capitulation!\u201d Those unhappy with the proposal said it rewards Russia and the separatists for years of violating the Minsk accords, begins a political process that would likely end with Russia absorbing at least the Donbas region, and demands no firm concessions from the Russians in return.\n\nZelensky insisted the withdrawal of Russian forces from Donbas would be worth giving the separatists the election they want. \u201cThere can be no elections at machine-gun point. If someone is out there, there will be no elections,\u201d he said.\n\nZelensky added that his proposal included unspecified \u201cred lines\u201d the Russians would not be allowed to cross.\n\nThe separatists themselves made it clear before launching their overnight attacks that they would not accept any deal for limited autonomy.\n\n\u201cIt will be we who decide the language we speak, what kind of economy we have, how our judicial system will be formed, how our people\u2019s militia will be defending our citizens, and how we will be integrated into Russia,\u201d militant leaders in Donbas declared in a statement rejecting Zelensky\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Kremlin indicated on Friday that it saw Zelensky\u2019s proposal as a \u201cpositive thing\u201d and said Moscow is still interested in an \u201call-for-all prisoner swap\u201d with Ukraine as a step toward peace.", "description": "Officials in Ukraine on Friday reported 41 attacks by Russia-backed separatists against Ukrainian army positions.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Vladimir-Putin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
