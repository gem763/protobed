Australia's win means Georgia's totemic flanker Mamuka \"Gorgodzilla\" Gorgodze heads into retirement without the win over a tier one team he so desired.\n\nWallabies full-back Kurtley Beale of Australia is assisted off the pitch by medical staff", "description": "Australia made heavy work of it in difficult conditions but outlasted a tough Georgia team to round out their Pool D campaign with an unconvincing 27-8 victory on Friday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/19586228-0-image-a-39_1570795881034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
