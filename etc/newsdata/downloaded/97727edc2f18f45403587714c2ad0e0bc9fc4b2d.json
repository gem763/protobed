Max will pitch until his neck decides he can\u2019t pitch anymore.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd there will be no pitch count or limitations.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see myself telling Max, you\u2019re only going to go 75 pitches. He\u2019s going to want to go out there and go as long as he can.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe moment was made possible by the brilliance of Stephen Strasburg, who is turning into Bob Gibson this postseason.\n\nStrasburg became the first pitcher in baseball history to go 5-0 in the postseason, and nearly became the first pitcher since Johnny Cueto of the San Francisco Giants to pitch a complete game in the World Series, Game 2 of 2015, against the Kansas City Royals. He was pulled after 8 \u2153 innings.\n\nHis ERA now 1.98.\n\nStrasburg has been nothing short of phenomenal. He is yielding a 1.95 ERA, and has struck out 47 batters with just four walks (two on consecutive batters) Tuesday, in 37 innings.\n\nAnd now, for the first time in World Series history, we have a series in which the visiting team has won every game.\n\nREPLAY: Nats protest Game 6 after controversial call\n\nSWAG: Bregman, Soto show each other up with bat carries\n\nThe Astros, who had bludgeoned the Nationals in Washington, sweeping all three games by a combined score of 19-3, scored two runs in the first inning off Strasburg, and then went silent.\n\nThe only time Strasburg got into the slightest bit of trouble was in the middle innings. In the fourth, he walked Yuli Gurriel and Yordan Alvarez on nine pitches, but then came back and struck out Carlos Correa.\n\nIn the fifth, he gave up a one-out single to Josh Reddick and a double into the left-field corner by George Springer. No sweat. He got Jose Altuve to flail away on a curveball in the dirt, and Michael Brantley hit into a sharp groundout.\n\nHe cruised the rest of the way, making the Nationals 9-0 this postseason on games started by Strasburg and Scherzer.\n\nThe Astros, who have wanted to be remembered for having one of the greatest teams of all time, have been outscored 24-9 in their three games at Minute Maid Park.\n\nThey have one last chance.\n\n\u201cWhat I've learned over the last few years of winning is that when something doesn't go your way, there's an immediate overreaction,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cto like, \u201cWhat's going on, what's wrong with your team?\u2019 And my message is always that, \u201cNo, we're the same team. We're the same talent. We have the same vibe. We have the same in preparation. It's like you get defensive on your team when you get doubted.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf nothing else, the Nats\u2019 victory at least took the focus off the umpiring crew. Yan Gomes hit a leadoff single in the seventh, and Trea Turner hit a slow roller to the right side of the mound. Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded it, and threw it off the back of Turner touching first base. Yet, home-plate umpire Sam Holbrook called Turner out for running inside the first-base line, and the Nats went ballistic.\n\nThe umpiring crew took 4 minutes and 32 seconds to review the play, it stood, and although Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer one batter later, Martinez was so incensed in between innings that he charged Holbrook and was ejected.\n\nThe Nats played the game under protest, but of course, waived it once they won.\n\nGame 7.\n\nIt should be magical.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Stephen Strasburg led the Nationals to a 7-2 victory over the Astros to set up a dramatic Game 7 in the World Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/80e1fa92-6a4b-4946-8313-eb16639a7c28-USATSI_13589678.jpg?crop=2551,1913,x0,y48&width=2421&height=1913&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
