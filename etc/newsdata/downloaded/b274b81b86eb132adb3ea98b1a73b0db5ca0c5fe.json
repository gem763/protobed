This is how the day unfolded.\n\n7.00am \u2013 A delegation of cross-party MPs led by Dominic Grieve is spotted on the Eurostar to Brussels. Peter Grant of the SNP tweeted that they were going \u201cto ask the EU not to let Johnston [sic] crash us out without a deal\u201d.\n\n7.47am \u2013 ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports that Downing Street is downbeat about a deal. He quotes a government source saying: \u201cChances of a deal are low. DUP seem unlikely to support anything that\u2019s negotiable\u201d.\n\n8.10am \u2013 David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, tells the BBC\u2019s Today programme that some Tory Brexiters would be strongly influenced by the DUP in deciding whether or not to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. He says he would have to read the detail of any new deal before he decided whether or not to support it.\n\nCould Boris Johnson's Brexit deal pass through parliament? Read more\n\n8.19am \u2013 The BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports that negotiations have resumed in Brussels.\n\n9.20am \u2013 Speaking to Sky News\u2019s All Out Politics, Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group (ERG), which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, does not firmly rule out accepting another extension, keeping the UK in the EU beyond 31 October. He says that most people in the country, particularly outside London, just want to see the matter sorted.\n\n9.30am \u2013 The DUP denies multiple reports that it had been offered \u201cbillions\u201d by Downing Street over the past two days in return for their support for a deal. A DUP spokesman says: \u201cThis is categorically untrue and utter nonsense.\u201c\n\n10.00am \u2013 Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, uses his questions to spell out his party\u2019s position. He claims that removing what was seen as the DUP veto over the arrangements would breach the Good Friday agreement and that the plan being considered by the government would \u201cdiminish\u201d the powers of the Northern Ireland assembly.\n\n11.45am \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn plays down the suggestion that he could remove the whip from any Labour MP who votes for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.

However, the question is whether the negotiators will be able to bridge the remaining gaps in advance of tomorrow\u2019s council.\u201d\n\n2.30pm \u2013 Boris Johnson holds a meeting of his cabinet. Ministers are not briefed about the full contents of a possible deal because it isn\u2019t ready yet.\n\n2.45pm \u2013 Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, tells journalists: \u201cTheoretically in seven to eight hours everything should be clear. It is still undergoing changes and the basic foundations of this agreement are ready and theoretically we could accept a deal tomorrow.\u201d\n\n4.30pm \u2013 Downing Street announces that it has tabled a motion for the House of Commons and the House of Lords to sit on Saturday, from 9.30am until 2pm.

The PM told Tory MPs that the government was \u201con the Hillary Step\u201d in relation to the Brexit talks, referring to what was famous as the most perilous part of the route up Everest. Leaving the meeting ERG leader Steve Baker says the deal in the works \u201ccould well be tolerable\u201d.\n\n6.00pm \u2013 The French president, Emmanuel Macron, says he \u201cwants to believe\u201d an agreement on Brexit is being finalised among negotiators in Brussels.
