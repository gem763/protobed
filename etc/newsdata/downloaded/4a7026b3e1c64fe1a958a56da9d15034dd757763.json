The wide receiver\u2019s release highlighted a flurry of roster moves Saturday as the Redskins trimmed down from 90 players to 53.\n\nWashington was unable to trade its 2016 first-rounder, who had underwhelmed in his first three seasons. The Redskins elected to keep six receivers, all of whom had better camps than Doctson: Paul Richardson, Terry McLaurin, Trey Quinn, Kelvin Harmon, Robert Davis and Steven Sims. The Redskins will save $620,000 after cutting Doctson, but will have $2.5 million in dead money.\n\nBeyond Doctson, here\u2019s how the rest of the Redskins\u2019 roster shaped up:\n\nQuarterback (3): Case Keenum, Colt McCoy, Dwayne Haskins\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise after last year\u2019s injuries, but the Redskins keep three quarterbacks on the roster for the first time since 2016. Washington also released quarterback Jalan McClendon on Saturday.\n\nRunning back (5): Adrian Peterson, Derrius Guice, Chris Thompson, Byron Marshall, Shaun Wilson\n\nThere were a few surprises when it came to the running back position Saturday. First: Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s continuous praise wasn\u2019t enough to save 2017 fourth-rounder Samaje Perine from getting cut. It was slightly odd to see Perine getting carries in the fourth quarter of Thursday\u2019s preseason finale, and now we know why: he was on the bubble more than most expected. Marshall, another Gruden favorite, makes it instead.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilson, who went undrafted last year, was an unexpected addition, but he might not be on the roster for long. Wilson is a candidate to be placed on injured reserve as the running back is dealing with an ankle injury, per reports. If the Redskins had placed Wilson on injured reserve prior to Sunday, Wilson would not have been eligible to return this season. Now, the Redskins can place Wilson on IR and bring him back after a minimum of eight weeks. It is also possible the Redskins keep him as an inactive while the injury heals.\n\nWide receiver (6): Paul Richardson, Terry McLaurin, Trey Quinn, Kelvin Harmon, Robert Davis and Steven Sims\n\nAs it turns out, the fourth preseason game absolutely mattered. Following an impressive performance, Steven Sims beat out Cam Sims for a roster spot by hauling in a touchdown and making an impact as a kick returner in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Cam Sims, who shined in training camp, had a quiet preseason and didn\u2019t help his cause with at least two drops. After the game, Gruden called Sims a \u201clittle fireball\u201d and the Redskins have enjoyed watching the undrafted slot receiver progress.\n\nDavis also made it one year removed from a gruesome leg injury, following a strong preseason.\n\nTight end (3): Jordan Reed, Vernon Davis and Jeremy Sprinkle\n\nBy keeping only three tight ends, that could be a sign the Redskins feel confident Reed will be out of concussion protocol when they travel to Philly to open the season next week. J.P. Holtz could be a candidate for the practice squad after being cut.\n\nOffensive line (9): Donald Penn, Ereck Flowers, Chase Roullier, Brandon Scherff, Morgan Moses, Geron Christian, Wes Martin, Ross Pierschbacher, Tony Bergstrom\n\nThere aren\u2019t really any surprises here. The Redskins did not have to use a roster spot on tackle Trent Williams, who is on a separate list due to his holdout.\n\nSpecialists (3): Dustin Hopkins, Tress Way, Nick Sundberg\n\nThese were also set as soon as Sundberg recovered from back surgery earlier this offseason.\n\nDefensive line (5): Daron Payne, Jonathan Allen, Matt Ioannidis, Tim Settle, Caleb Brantley\n\nThe Redskins elected not to keep six defensive linemen, so players like Ryan Bee and JoJo Wicker were cut. Bee could possibly be brought back to the practice squad, should he clear waivers.\n\nLinebackers (9): Ryan Kerrigan, Montez Sweat, Ryan Anderson, Cassanova McKinzy, Jordan Brailford, Cole Holcomb, Josh Harvey-Clemons, Jon Bostic, Shaun Dion Hamilton\n\nLike Wilson, Brailford was likely added to the roster with the intention of placing him on IR. The seventh-round linebacker has been out the past few weeks with a groin injury and Gruden said recently Brailford was still a \u201cfew weeks away\u201d from full recovery.\n\nMcKinzy suffered a concussion against Baltimore, but reports indicate the Redskins are confident he\u2019ll be fine for Philadelphia.\n\nCornerback (6): Josh Norman, Quinton Dunbar, Fabian Moreau, Jimmy Moreland, Greg Stroman, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie\n\nAdonis Alexander was waived a year after the Redskins used a sixth-round pick on the corner in the supplemental draft. The 22-year-old never found his footing after suffering a quad injury in training camp, and by the time he returned, there was an established pecking order in front of him. The Redskins hope to sign Alexander to the practice squad.\n\nSafety (4): Landon Collins, Montae Nicholson, Deshazor Everett, Troy Apke\n\nJeremy Reaves played all 84 defensive snaps Thursday and had flashed in moments throughout the preseason, but that wasn\u2019t enough to save him a roster spot. In the end, the Redskins opted to carry four safeties.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
