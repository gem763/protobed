Bacow, details how Epstein donated millions of dollars between 1998 and 2007.\n\nThe contributions were largely \u201cdesignated for current use, not as endowed funds,\u201d the letter states. \u201c[N]early all were spent years ago for their intended purposes in support of research and education,\u201d it reads.\n\nThe largest contribution, Bacow said, was made in 2003, when the financier gifted $6.5 million to go toward the university\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The sum of the other gifts was approximately $2.4 million, the letter states.\n\nOf the approximately $8.9 million Harvard received, $186,000 remains from a collection of funds that were donated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Bacow said.\n\n\u201cAfter consultation with the Dean of the FAS, we have decided that the University will redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein\u2019s egregiously repugnant crimes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvard did not receive any donations from Epstein following his 2008 guilty plea in connection to soliciting prostitution, Bacow said, noting that the university actually rejected a donation from him.\n\nThe financier was indicted in July of this year on federal sex trafficking-related charges.\n\nHe was found dead in the early hours of Aug. 10 inside his Metropolitan Correctional Center jail cell in lower Manhattan. A New York City medical examiner determined he committed suicide by hanging.\n\nFollowing Epstein's death, a Southern District of New York judge dismissed the criminal case against him. Several victims have since filed lawsuits against his estate.\n\nHarvard is also looking into Epstein\u2019s designation as a Visiting Fellow for the Department of Psychology \u2013 bestowed upon him by a former faculty member who had been on the receiving end of some of the multimillionaire\u2019s gifts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cLet me end where I began. Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible,\u201d Bacow concluded. \u201cI profoundly regret Harvard\u2019s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nFOX Business's Melissa Francis contributed to this story.", "description": "President Lawrence S.
