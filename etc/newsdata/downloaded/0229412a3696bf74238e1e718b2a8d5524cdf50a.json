The costs will only be known once we have the design.\u201d\n\nSecretary for Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Melusi Matshiya added that they were coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing.\n\n\u201cYes, work is going on, but the lead ministry is that of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing when it comes to construction work,\u201d Matshiya said.\n\nAccording to Herald journalists who visited the National Heroes Acre where Mugabe\u2019s tomb will be located, authorities have already brought in earthmoving equipment and construction personnel.\n\nThe location was confirmed last week by his nephew Leo Mugabe, who works as the family spokesperson, who announced that they had agreed to a government request to bury Mugabe in an official cemetery in the capital of Harare.\n\n\u201cThe government and the chiefs went to the Heroes Acre, showed each other where President Mugabe is going to be buried, and that place would take about 30 days to complete,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what that means is the burial will take that long.\u201d\n\nThe Mugabe family had previously insisted that he be buried at his home village in the district of Zvimba, around 50 miles outside Harare, suggesting that a symbolic funeral at Heroes\u2019 Acre as a compromise.\n\nEventually, it was agreed that he be given a state funeral in what turned out to be a sparsely attended ceremony at the National Sports Stadium here in Harare. Despite having a capacity 60,000 people, it is estimated that three-quarters of the stadium remained empty, a sign of his widespread unpopularity in recent years.\n\nThe shrine currently being built will be paid for by taxpayers. The government has yet to reveal its price, or even offer an estimate.\n\nMugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before being ousted in a coup in 2017 and replaced with former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Despite allowing protests so long as they enabled his rule, Mnangagwa has attempted to rehabilitate Mugabe\u2019s image while in power, establishing a national holiday for the dictator and spending millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars on luxury amenities for Mugabe and wife Grace. Zimbabwe\u2019s impoverished citizens paid for, among other things, a 20-person staff of servants, three luxury vehicles, a \u201creasonably-sized\u201d mansion, and first-class international air travel.\n\nMugabe\u2019s 40-year leadership of Zimbabwe was marked by genocide, persecution of political opponents, and vote-rigging on an industrial scale. His left-wing economic policies also turned the country from of the wealthiest in Africa, into an unprecedented economic disaster of such a scale that his government was forced to introduce a one hundred trillion-dollar note before eventually reverting to the U.S. dollar.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Zimbabwe\u00a0refused to confirm this week how much the construction of a mausoleum for late dictator Robert Mugabe will cost.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Mugabe-death-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
