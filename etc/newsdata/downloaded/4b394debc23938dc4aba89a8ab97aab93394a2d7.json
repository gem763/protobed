It sold 6,186 homes in the quarter, 2.6% higher than last year.\n\nHowever, the U.S. homebuilder cautioned that affordability, though improved, was still an issue in particular markets and buyer segments. Average sales price fell marginally to $426,000 in the quarter.\n\nOrders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 12.7% to 6,031 units in the period.\n\nThe company's net income fell 5.7% to $273.1 million, or 99 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Total revenue rose 2.3% to $2.71 billion.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, above analysts' estimates of 92 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nShares of the company were little changed, but are up about 47% this year, outpacing a 45.3% increase in the broader PHLX Housing Index.\n\n(Reporting by Sanjana Shivdas and Ashwini Raj in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni)", "description": "Homebuilder PulteGroup Inc raised its full-year forecast for home sales on Tuesday, after it posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit as lower mortgage rates boosted demand.
