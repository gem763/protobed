He has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer.

Pictured, anti-government office workers wearing masks attend a lunch time protest in Hong Kong's Central\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam (front, middle) announced the decision at a press conference with other city officials\n\nThe ban was passed under a colonial-era emergency law known as The Emergency Regulations Ordinance.\n\nThe law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike which was last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city's chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the use of the Ordinance for the first time in more than half a century could set a dangerous precedent.\n\nActivists and many legislators have also concerned the ban could be counter-productive, impractical and difficult to enforce in a city bubbling with anger and where tens of thousands have often defied police bans on rallies to take to the streets.\n\nThe demonstrations in Hong Kong were initially sparked at the beginning of June by a proposed law that would allow some criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland China to stand trial.

In the documents, the police manual changed some guidelines on how officers could act when considering force. It also removed a line that stated officers should be accountable for their actions.\n\nWilly Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: 'Even though the mask ban is just a small move under the Emergency Ordinance, it is a dangerous first step.\n\n'If the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties.'\n\n'This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,' pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told AFP.\n\n'And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner.'\n\n'It is ironic that a colonial-era weapon is being used by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party,' Joshua Wong, a leading activists who has been jailed a number of times, told AFP.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said that any new government measures in Hong Kong must be grounded in law and protect the right to freedom of assembly.\n\nReferring to the situation in the financial hub, UN human rights spokeswoman Marta Hurtado told a briefing in Geneva on Friday: 'Any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible.'\n\nShe added: 'Freedom of peaceful assembly is a fundamental right and should be enjoyed without restriction to the greatest extent possible.'\n\n'Five demands, not one less!' many protesters shouted during Friday's rallies.
