He said Iran has the ability to go beyond 20% enrichment concentration of uranium, a level analysts say is a short step away from 90% enrichment \u2013 weapons-grade level. Iran already has already surpassed stockpile limits and enrichment levels set by the deal. Kamalvandi warned several times in his comments that Iran was rapidly approaching a point that would mean a full withdrawal from the deal.\n\n\"Our stockpile is quickly increasing, we hope they will come to their senses,\" he said.\n\nThe move had been expected for several days.\n\n\"The third step may not be striking in appearance, but it is of an extremely important nature, and will considerably accelerate the activities of the country\u2019s nuclear energy organization,\" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said in comments carried by state television on Wednesday, previewing the action.\n\n\"In my opinion, this step is the most important one that we will take, and its impacts will be extraordinarily huge,\" Rouhani said, adding that Iran would \"immediately start (nuclear-related) research and development\" prohibited by the terms of the deal\n\nIran has vowed to reduce its commitments to the nuclear deal every 60 days until European powers find a way of compensating it for the U.S. sanctions. Iran exceeded the limits agreed under the accord on its stockpile of enriched uranium in July, when it also breached a cap on enrichment levels, raising them from 3.67 to 4.5%.\n\nEven before Tehran's official announcement, a top Trump administration official blasted the anticipated move. \"We believe this is nuclear extortion. Iran does not need to enrich fissile material to have a peaceful nuclear program,\" Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nBritain's foreign ministry described Iran's move as \"deeply concerning.\"\n\nDespite the move, Iran technically remains part of the accord.\n\nDiplomatic outreach?: Iran official Javad Zarif arrives unexpectedly at G7\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has floated a proposal to give Iran a $15 billion line of credit if Tehran agrees to come back into full compliance with the nuclear agreement. The line of credit would be guaranteed by Iran\u2019s oil revenues and would require the Trump administration to ease U.S. sanctions aimed at barring Iran from selling its oil, France\u2019s foreign minister told reporters earlier this week.\n\nBut Trump administration officials flatly reject the possibility of easing sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe economic penalties are part of Trump\u2019s \"maximum pressure\" campaign, aimed at strangling Iran\u2019s economy and forcing its leaders into a new round of negotiations.\n\n\"We can\u2019t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure,\" Hook said. \"We are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers.\"\n\nIndeed, the Trump administration is moving in the opposite direction \u2013 issuing new sanctions at a seemingly frenetic pace. On Wednesday, Hook said the U.S. would target what he called an \"oil for terror\" network of individuals, entities and vessels that he said Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps uses to illicitly sell its oil.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration sanctioned Iran\u2019s space program. And last week, it blacklisted an Iranian oil tanker and its captain as it moved toward Syria.", "description": "Tehran takes new actions to erode its commitment to the 2015 nuclear accord with world powers and accelerates\u00a0its nuclear activities.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.T2FscTIFTOnH7ckwNNJcQ--~B/aD0xNTc0O3c9MjM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/0be922ae044bd09947b339435f7772a8", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
