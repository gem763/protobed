We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nIt\u2019s the final Thin Thursday of 2019. Only five games are in the slate.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nFranmil Reyes \u2013 OF \u2013 Cleveland Indians (at Dylan Cease)\n\nAs is often the case, Reyes is among the top options for pure power. While he doesn\u2019t deliver consistent day-to-day production, few hitters are likelier to hit multiple home runs. Cease has struggled to keep the ball in the yard during his first taste of the majors (1.85 HR/9). As a result, Reyes projects to hit one-third of a home run tonight.\n\nJosh Reddick \u2013 OF \u2013 Houston Astros (at Jaime Barria)\n\nReddick is a very different pick. The Astros ninth hitter should be considered as a contrarian plug-in to an otherwise very popular Astros stack. Reddick figures to deliver solid, unspectacular numbers as part of the Houston onslaught. You\u2019re hoping for a couple hits or walks with some run production tacked on. He chains well with Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman.\n\nSeth Brown \u2013 OF \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Felix Hernandez)\n\nKhris Davis \u2013 OF \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Felix Hernandez)\n\nStory continues\n\nKing Felix is probably making his last start as a Mariner. As we\u2019re all aware, he\u2019s a shadow of his former self. He\u2019s caught the homer bug (2.17 HR/9) while struggling to induce whiffs. He\u2019s still a ground ball pitcher which works against him in this matchup against a very fly ball-oriented Athletics offense.\n\nWe missed out on an interesting matchup for Davis yesterday due to a stomach bug. He might sit again. If not, he\u2019s showing some signs of life in September \u2013 just in time for the postseason. As for Brown, it\u2019s shocking that he\u2019s posted a .328/.384/.507 batting line through 73 plate appearances without hitting a home run. Earlier in the year, he slugged 37 big flies in 500 Triple-A plate appearances. His line drive and fly ball-centric approach should yield fruit tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Jack Mayfield, Lewis Brinson, Ryan Flaherty, Robinson Cano, Pablo Reyes, Zack Collins\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nFrancisco Lindor \u2013 SS \u2013 Cleveland Indians (at Dylan Cease)\n\nLindor is strangely cheap for what figures to be the third-most popular stack in a thin slate. Cease has tossed a few strong outings \u2013 including against these same Indians. However, he\u2019s had trouble with command and (of course) home runs. There\u2019s no complicated reason to want Lindor tonight \u2013 he\u2019s one of the top five hitters in the slate despite a mid-tier price tag. As an added bonus, Guaranteed Rate Field is power friendly. And for the cherry on top, the White Sox bullpen is exploitable.\n\nAlso Consider: Michael Brantley, Matt Chapman, Brandon Nimmo, Sean Murphy, Matt Olson, Yasiel Puig\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nZack Wheeler \u2013 SP \u2013 New York Mets (vs Marlins)\n\nWheeler is the only pitcher available who looks like a dollar-for-dollar value. It\u2019s hard to judge these things in the last week of the season though. There\u2019s a chance the Mets will cut his outing short. However, since he\u2019s set to become a free agent soon, they don\u2019t have much incentive to worry about his health. I\u2019m expected a fairly typical outing. If that\u2019s the case, he projects to deliver around seven innings with as many strikeouts versus a feeble Marlins offense.\n\nAlso Consider: Yordan Alvarez, Pete Alonso", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Thursday, September 26.
