Royal LePage is owned by Brookfield Asset Management Inc.\n\nHousing affordability has become a key issue in the federal election campaign. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto while the Conservatives plan to review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers, remove it from mortgage renewals and extend mortgage amortizations.\n\nPrices resumed their upward track even after governments instituted regulations to tame the market, thanks to an influx of immigrants, a lack of supply and lower interest rates. Most markets have rebounded following an adjustment period last year, with Toronto seeing increased sales and a rebound to near-record prices.\n\nIn Toronto, the aggregate price of a home will rise by 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter to $859,301, and condos, once the most affordable option, have surpassed $600,000 and are poised to gain more, according to Royal LePage. While the Vancouver region continues to adjust to a policy-driven sales and price slump, the rate of price decline has slowed and Royal LePage expects it will slow further as buyers see cheaper prices as an opportunity to get into the market.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Even with no policy changes home prices to rise 1.5% in fourth quarter", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/housing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
