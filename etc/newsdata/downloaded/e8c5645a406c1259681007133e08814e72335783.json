The PKK is a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization; the PYD is the civilian political Kurdish party running Syrian Kurdistan, or Rojava.\n\nThe female fighter is believed to have been a member of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella coalition of mostly-Kurdish forces allied with the United States before President Donald Trump withdrew U.S. forces from the region this month. The SDF includes members of the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and Women\u2019s Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nThe YPG includes soldiers of both sexes; the YPJ is an all-female unit.\n\n[Warning: graphic images]\n\nThe man filming the video reportedly identifies himself and his peers as members of the \u201cMujahideen of Faylaq al-Majd,\u201d a jihadist group now allied with Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched an invasion of Syria named \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d this month aimed at eradicating the indigenous Kurdish presence of northern Syria (Rojava) and replacing it with mostly Arab refugees currently in Turkey. Erdogan openly stated that Turkish soldiers would fight alongside the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of mostly Sunni fighters created during the height of the Syrian Civil War to take down dictator Bashar al-Assad. The FSA includes several jihadist elements, including the al-Mahdy fighters seen in the video.\n\nThe SOHR did not offer a definitive date for when the video was taken, only that the events recorded occurred amid the \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d invasion. Rudaw sites the Kurdish Hawar news agency as dating the woman\u2019s death to Tuesday and the location of the video to be somewhere outside Kobani, a Syrian-Kurdish border town that Erdogan had agreed to leave untouched in his invasion.\n\nRudaw reported Wednesday that other videos of jihadist desecrating the bodies of women fighting on the front lines have surfaced from \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\nIn another video obtained by Rudaw, another YPJ fighter seems to have been captured in Tuesday\u2019s attack by the 3rd Corps of the Faylaq al-Majd, by the Ahrar Dar Ta\u2019azah battalions. \u201cI took this female pig prisoner!\u201d a fighter is heard saying, as they surround a confused female, with indistinct shouts of \u201cbeautiful\u201d being heard in the background. It is not clear if they are referring to the captured YPJ fighter.\n\nRudaw also highlighted the killing, confirmed by the SDF this week, of Hevrin Khalaf, a woman\u2019s rights advocate and Secretary General of the Future Syria Party, a party active in Rojava.\n\n\u201cShe was taken out of her car during a Turkish-backed attack and executed by Turkish backed mercenary factions on the International Road between Qamishlo and Manbij, where her driver who was also martyred,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Council, the civilian organization tied to the SDF, said in a statement in which it accused the Turkish government of targeting and killing \u201cunarmed civilians.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Hevrin Khalaf, was the Secretary General of the Future Syria Party, a party with a political orientation towards Syria in general, is far from military agendas, equally approaches all Syrian parties since the past one and a half years to establish a pluralistic society that Syria lacked;\u201d the SDF said.\n\nKurds in both Syria and Iraq have long accepted women among their rank and file soldiers and have sent the YPJ to the front lines. Kurdish women were particularly effective fighters against the Islamic State at the height of its \u201ccaliphate\u201d in 2014-2016, as ISIS jihadis feared that being killed by a woman would deny them the full rewards of martyrdom in Heaven.\n\n\u201cThey are so scared of us! If we kill them they can\u2019t go to heaven,\u201d Haveen, a 22-year-old YPJ fighter, told the Independent in 2016. \u201cWe make loud calls of happiness when we see them to let them know we are coming. That\u2019s when they become cowards.\u201d\n\nThe YPJ have for years been among the most effective anti-jihadist militias on the ground in Syria. Erdogan, an avowed Islamist, is seeking to destroy the YPJ and its co-ed fellow Kurdish militia, the YPG, because he claims they are indistinguishable from the PKK. The Syrian Kurdish fighters have not publicly disavowed the largely Turkish-Kurdish PKK, but have also not openly aided any terrorist PKK activity within Turkish borders, focusing primarily on fighting ISIS.\n\nErdogan\u2019s government has, in contrast, done little to prevent ISIS sympathizers from entering the Syrian fray through the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cTurkey has been hosting ISIS for years,\u201d Can D\u00fcndar, a Turkish journalist forced into exile in Germany for exposing Erdogan\u2019s ties to jihadist militias in Syria, said this week. \u201cEveryone knows it in the region.\u201d\n\nThe Free Syrian Army responsible for the video posted by the SOHR was a U.S. ally under President Barack Obama. According to Obama\u2019s former special envoy against ISIS, Brett McGurk, the Obama administration \u201cinvested significant amounts of time, significant American resources, to build a force that was known as the Free Syrian Army.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "A video surfaced showing jihadis allied with Turkey shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and kicking around the dead body of a Kurdish woman.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/syria-turkey-fighters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
