I didn\u2019t think the Left was so mean,\u201d she said when asked about how her experience for running for president has been. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the Left lied like this. I thought the Right did that. I thought we were better.\u201d\n\nRemnick asked her to speak further about what she considered to be unfair treatment.\n\n\"Oh, come on, you just mentioned crystal gazing,\" she answered. \"There is no crystal in my home, David. There's never been a crystal on stage when I've talked. I've never told an AIDS patient not to take their medicine. I've never told anyone not to take their medicine. I've never told anyone their lovelessness created their disease.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm Jewish, I go to the doctor. This idea that I\u2019m that person.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Williamson had to defend herself from an \"overly secularized Left\" attacking her for discussing prayer and the right of people of faith to belong in the Democratic Party.\n\nPrayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent. People of faith belong in the Democratic Party, and will be necessary to the effort if we\u2019re to win in 2020. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nI was born and raised in Texas so I\u2019ve seen it. Millions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nWhen I was growing up there was a vital religious Left. It is BECAUSE of my spiritual views that I\u2019m a Democrat. The idea that religious or spiritual people should find no home in the Democratic Party is hardly the view of someone wanting to win in 2020. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nHer defensive remarks came after this now-deleted tweet:", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:08:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/63/902fd1a5-df16-4fcc-b69b-0377b6d66daf.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
