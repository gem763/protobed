This proved, unsurprisingly, that the president doesn\u2019t know much about history \u2013 for a start, victims of lynching couldn\u2019t look forward to a trial heavily stacked in their favor, which is probably what awaits Trump in the Senate. It also showed that there is no depth to which Trump will not stoop in an attempt to distract attention from his wrongdoing.\n\nIt was no surprise that Trump wanted to create a distraction on the day that the impeachment inquiry heard its most explosive testimony yet. But we shouldn\u2019t let him. Stunning new details were provided by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, who the state department tried to block from testifying before Congress. He went anyway, and what he said provided the most direct evidence yet that Trump ordered military assistance to Ukraine to be withheld until Kyiv agreed to take action that would benefit the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nRepublicans are finally realising that Trump is his own worst enemy \u2013 and theirs | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nTaylor testified that even though he was the top American representative in Ukraine, he found himself undercut by Trump appointees who ran their own \u201cunofficial\u201d Ukraine policy. One of this latter group, Gordon Sondland, told Taylor that \u201ceverything\u201d Ukraine wanted from Washington \u2013 including a meeting with Trump and security assistance for its war against Russia \u2013 was dependent on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announcing investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nWhen Taylor raised concerns over what was happening, he was met with the sort of inversion of truth and of the meaning of the English language which the Trump administration has long practiced. Both Sondland and Trump insisted no quid pro quo was expected of Ukraine \u2013 before spelling out precisely the actions Kyiv would have to take in order to receive security assistance. According to Taylor, Sondland even told him that Trump \u201cis a businessman\u201d and that businessmen always make sure to collect what they are owed.\n\nTaylor also said that Zelenskiy was being pressured to give a statement about opening the investigations on CNN, making clear that the aim was to influence US public opinion rather than to actually tackle corruption in Ukraine. Officials in Kyiv certainly understood the message they were receiving, and were deeply disturbed by the contents. According to Taylor, Zelenskiy\u2019s national security adviser \u201cconveyed to me that President Zelenskiy did not want to be used as a pawn in a US re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nRather than denying the facts that Taylor reported, the White House last night dismissed the impeachment inquiry as \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats\u201d. But to any reasonable person, Taylor is impossible to dismiss as a partisan hack. A former infantry officer who served in Vietnam, he has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and was first appointed as ambassador to Ukraine by George W Bush. Taylor was critical of aspects of Barack Obama\u2019s policy towards Ukraine, including his administration\u2019s decision not to provide lethal military aid \u2013 the same military aid that Trump later announced he would supply and then corruptly withheld.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony removes any last plausible line of defense of Trump\u2019s conduct. Trump clearly perverted US official diplomacy in pursuit of his own private interests. The \u201cinvestigations\u201d he pressured Ukraine to open into his political opponents were based on conspiracy theories, meaning the investigations themselves could only be shams. Trump was not asking for an honest investigation of wrongdoing. Instead, he wanted Kyiv to make up dirt on his political enemies to substantiate the conspiracy theories he had heard about on TV \u2013 or to lose the military aid it needed to survive. It is hard to think of a more shocking misuse of presidential power in foreign affairs.\n\nThe most disturbing fact of this whole mess is how close the plot Taylor described came to succeeding. If it hadn\u2019t been for the media, government whistleblowers and Congress, then the first words the American people heard on the matter might have been Zelenskiy appearing on CNN to announce an investigation into Hunter Biden. Instead, these forces came together to provide a vital check on a lawless president, just as they did during Watergate.\n\nThe work isn\u2019t yet done. Republicans will probably invent new excuses to protect the president. But support for removing Trump from office continues to rise, portending a difficult 2020 election both for the president and the Republican senators who continue to defend him. The idea that impeaching Trump was a political mistake, fashionable just weeks ago, looks misplaced in light of everything we have learned since. Impeachment, if pursued wisely, can actually be used to build a case for removing Trump and his protectors at the ballot box.\n\nAmerica deserves a president who doesn\u2019t use his office for personal enrichment and gain at the expense of the public good. It also deserves a president who has enough historical and moral sensibility not to describe his own richly deserved problems as a \u201clynching\u201d. Thanks in part to the unfolding impeachment inquiry, it might soon have one.\n\nAndy Gawthorpe is a lecturer in history and international studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands\n\n\n\n", "description": "Trump clearly perverted US official diplomacy in pursuit of his own private interests.
