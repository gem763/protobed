Is it an attempt to use a foreign country to influence the outcome of an election in a presidential year? Yes it is, obviously.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cIncidentally, it didn\u2019t take long for us to find that, we only had to dig through old Clinton transcripts for about 15 minutes... there are probably a lot more examples, and if we find them we will bring them to you.\u201d\n\nThe quote referenced by Carlson can be found among a collection of declassified documents relating to Blair.
