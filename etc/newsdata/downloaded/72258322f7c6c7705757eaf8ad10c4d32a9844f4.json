If the act was willful, wanton or malicious, the fine can be up to $250,000.\n\nThe guidelines go too far.\n\nFor example, it could now be illegal to call someone an \u201cillegal alien.\u201d\n\nBut the guidelines in fact go much further. They violate the constitutional rights of lawful New York residents in order to protect undocumented alien residents. What\u2019s more, making it easier for undocumented aliens to live and work in New York illegally is prohibited by a federal harboring provision that makes providing such assistance a criminal offense.\n\nHiring practices\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFederal law prohibits employers from knowingly hiring aliens who are not authorized to work in the United States. The objective is to eliminate the \"job magnet\" that draws undocumented aliens to the United States.\n\nThe New York guidelines restrict what employers can do to verify that a prospective employee has work authorization. For instance, the employer can't ask for additional documents if the prospective employee provides the required number of documents from the federal government's List of Acceptable Documents.\n\nAlso, reverification of employment authorization may result in fines, unless it is specifically authorized by federal law.\n\nIn other words, New York employers can be punished for taking additional steps to ensure that their alien employees are authorized to work in the United States.\n\nHousing protections\n\nHousing providers cannot refuse to rent or sell on the basis of an individual's actual or perceived immigration status or national origin. Questions related to immigration status or national origin are discouraged and may be a basis for presuming discriminatory animus.\n\nHarassment\n\nDisparate treatment may be considered harassment if it creates or fosters a work culture or atmosphere that is demeaning, humiliating, or offensive.\n\nEmployers have strict liability for harassment if the \u201charasser\u201d exercises managerial or supervisory responsibility. If the harasser is a coworker, the employer may still be liable if he knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take corrective action.\n\nThe severity or pervasiveness of harassment is relevant only to damages. Even a single comment that reflects discriminatory views about an employee's immigration status or national origin may be enough to constitute harassment.\n\nThe following example of disparate treatment \u2014 that the guide provides \u2014 indicates that the bar for establishing harassment on this basis is quite low: \"A hotel prohibits its housekeepers from speaking Spanish while cleaning because it would 'offend' hotel guests or make them uncomfortable.\"\n\nCalling someone an \"illegal alien\"\n\nUnder the guidelines, it is harassment to call someone at a workplace an \u201cillegal alien\u201d to demean, humiliate, or offend him.\n\nAccording to Hans Bader, this prohibits speech based on viewpoint, and the First Amendment prohibits viewpoint-based restrictions on speech.\n\nIf an ordinance bans all speech on the war in Afghanistan, it is a content-based regulation, but if it just bans speech that criticizes the war, it is a viewpoint-based regulation.\n\nBecause the government is taking sides in a debate when it engages in viewpoint discrimination, the Supreme Court has found such restrictions to be especially offensive to the First Amendment.\n\nReporting an undocumented worker to ICE\n\nIt may be harassment if providers of public accommodations or services report an undocumented alien to ICE. The guide provides the following example:\n\n\"At a rest stop, a bus driver of a coach bus company voluntarily identifies to federal immigration authorities passengers whom he perceives to be foreign based on their ethnicity and the language they are speaking. He invites the federal immigration authorities to do a search on the coach bus, telling the agent, \u2018Go ahead, round up the illegals.\u2019\u201d\n\nBader claims that this interferes with the enforcement of our federal immigration laws, which triggers federal preemption issues, and it violates the First Amendment freedom of petition right.\n\nThe courts generally find that freedom of petition covers reports made with an ulterior or discriminatory motive. For example, the Supreme Court held that a company\u2019s First Amendment freedom of petition gave it the right to file a factually well-grounded lawsuit even if its motive for filing was retaliation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHarboring\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act provides criminal penalties for concealing, harboring, or shielding aliens from detection who are in the United States illegally.\n\nIt does not specify what actions constitute \u201charboring.\u201d\n\nThis has been left to the courts, and the courts have not settled on one uniform definition. The most frequent characteristic the courts have used to identify \u201charboring,\u201d however, is that it facilitates an immigrant\u2019s remaining in the United States illegally \u2014 which seems to be the primary reason for New York's new guidelines.\n\nI can understand wanting to help undocumented aliens, but this is not the way to do it.\n\nNolan Rappaport was detailed to the House Judiciary Committee as an executive branch immigration law expert for three years.
