When [former race director] Charlie Whiting was here he made massive steps forward, so we will continue in that direction.\"\n\nLess than 24 hours after Hubert's death, Leclerc, who raced against the French driver in the junior categories of motor racing, delivered an impressive performance from pole position to take the chequered flag ahead of Hamilton, with Valtteri Bottas in third.\n\nLeclerc pointed towards the sky during Sunday's muted podium celebrations and later admitted his first grand prix win was bittersweet.\n\n\"On one hand a childhood dream has been realised,\" said Leclerc, 21. \"On the other hand it has been a very difficult weekend. I have lost a friend. I would like to dedicate my first win to him.\n\n\"We grew up together. Losing Anthoine takes me back to 2005 and my first French championship. There was him, Esteban (Ocon - Mercedes reserve driver), Pierre (Gasly - Toro Rosso driver) and myself. We were four kids dreaming of getting to Formula One.\n\n\"We have grown up in karting together, so to lose him is a big shock for me, and everyone in the sport.\n\n\"It was definitely the first situation for me where I have lost someone and then raced the following day. It is obviously quite challenging to close the visor and go through the exact corner [where he died] at the same speed as I did the day before.\n\n\"It is difficult to enjoy this victory, but hopefully in two or three weeks I will realise what happened.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Lewis Hamilton said Formula One will continue to improve safety following the death of Anthoine Hubert.
