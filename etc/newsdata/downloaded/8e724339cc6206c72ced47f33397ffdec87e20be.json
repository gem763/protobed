Add Interest\n\nA new round of tariffs Trump had threatened to go into effect this month will be delayed.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing bigger than what we're doing with China,\" Trump said at an Oval Office photo-op with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. \"And we have come to a very substantial phase one deal.\"\n\nThis is the first meeting between the two since earlier this year and the first high-level talks since negotiations broke down amid trade disagreements.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nStock markets surged earlier Friday when the president hinted in a tweet that \"good things are happening\" in anticipation of the U.S.-China talks.\n\nGood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nBefore departing the White House for a rally, the president said that the specifics of the deal are being finalized and suggested that U.S. farmers--who took a hit from China's punitive tariffs--could be among the first to see the benefits of the trade deal.\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\"We\u2019re papering it now, over the next three or four or five weeks, hopefully it will get finished,\" he said. \"I mean, it\u2019s incredible the deal for farmers. I think they\u2019ll have to go out and buy more land and buy bigger tractors.\"\n\nThe president said the partial trade deal covers intellectual property, financial services, and $40-$50 billion related to agricultural products.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have been engaging the Chinese delegation since talks between the two nations resumed.\n\nThe tariff hike planned this month on $250 billion dollars worth of Chinese products will no longer go into effect as Mnuchin described both sides as \"having reached a fundamental understanding of the key issues.\"\n\nThe retaliatory tariffs imposed by both sides eventually reached a fever pitch that negotiations between both sides have been consistently delayed to the point that they are now widely considered as a of cause of economic uncertainty, triggering fears of a global economic slowdown.\n\nThe trade talks come amid a impeachment inquiry triggered by a whistleblower's complaint accusing the president of pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president on a phone call to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's role with a Ukrainian energy company. Last week, Trump went so far as to publicly say China should investigate the Bidens.\n\nChina has said it will not do what Trump suggested.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States. Our position is consistent and clear,\u201d said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.\n\nWhen asked by ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl whether he mentioned an investigation of Joe Biden to the Chinese delegation, Trump said it wasn't discussed.\n\n\"They can do whatever they want,\" he said. \"We have to look into corruption but it was not brought up.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-China 'phase 1' trade deal, tariff truce on Friday after a months-long standoff.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-liu-he-01-gty-jt-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
