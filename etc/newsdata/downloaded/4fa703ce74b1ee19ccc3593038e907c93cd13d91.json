To sing about it and be funny is hard. \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d manages the trick because it\u2019s a fantasy about a man-eating plant. \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d pulled it off because Stephen Sondheim is a genius (although neither Richard Eder nor Walter Kerr at the New York Times thought so when the musical opened in 1979).\n\nNow comes the new musical \u201cScotland, PA,\u201d which takes the Bard\u2019s \u201cMacbeth,\u201d sets it in rural Pennsylvania in 1975, and makes fun of an ambitious couple (Ryan McCartan and Taylor Iman Jones) who dream of operating the next McDonald\u2019s. Their eponymous restaurant is called McBeth\u2019s.\n\nA presentation of the Roundabout Theatre Company, \u201cScotland, PA\u201d opened Wednesday at Off Broadway\u2019s Laura Pels Theatre, and is based on the 2001 indie film of the same title. The film \u201cScotland, PA\u201d artfully balances the whimsy of having two killers flip burgers with its gritty, grainy, faded black-and-white trailer-park mise-en-scene. The musical \u201cScotland, PA\u201d is all primary colors, although Anna Louizos\u2019s set design gives it an eerie \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d aura before the McDonald\u2019s color scheme completely takes over.\n\nAlso Read: 'For Colored Girls' Theater Review: Ntozake Shange's '70s Classic Returns in Many-Hued Vibrancy\n\nMichael Mitnick\u2019s book for the musical turns the witches into refugees from some Renaissance fair (garish costumes by Tracy Christensen) who are really just \u201cvoices\u201d in the head of the killer Mac. This trio is credited as the Stoners (Wonu Ogunfowora, Alysha Umphress and Kaleb Wells), and they\u2019re poor cousins to the Urchin trio in \u201cLittle Shop.\u201d Whenever Shakespeare\u2019s tale is about to take off, the Stoners materialize to wink, point fingers and underline the crimes with Day-Glo stripes.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a good idea to send up the McDonald\u2019s culture with relentlessly bouncy songs that never rise above the level of fast-food jingles from the 1970s. Last week, David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori opened their new musical, \u201cSoft Power,\u201d giving us a song about the Electoral College. \u201cScotland, PA\u201d songwriter Adam Gwon outdoes them with a song about \u201cDrive-Thru\u201d windows at fast-food restaurants.\n\nAlso Read: 'Bella Bella' Theater Review: Harvey Fierstein Presents a Trumpian Candidate on the Left\n\nMitnick\u2019s book borrows here and there from Billy Morrissette\u2019s screenplay, and most of the better jokes go to the character Banko, played to airhead perfect by Jay Armstrong Johnson. Whether he\u2019s throwing a terrible party or not scoring with girls, Johnson brings considerable charm and great timing to his portrait of a total loser. He\u2019s different but just as good as Keanu Reeves and Sean Penn in \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High,\u201d only a few years older, tragically. When Johnson\u2019s character is murdered \u2014 he\u2019s a stand-in for Banquo, after all \u2014 the comedy of \u201cScotland, PA\u201d loses its only source of oxygen.\n\nLonny Price directs with a retro razzmatazz as if it were 1975 and \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d and \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d had never happened. Yet.\n\nRead original story \u2018Scotland, PA\u2019 Theater Review: Macbeth Flips Burgers in This McDreadful Musical At TheWrap", "description": "Killing people is easy.
