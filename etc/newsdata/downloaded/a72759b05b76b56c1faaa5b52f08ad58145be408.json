It\u2019s just the nation\u2019s laws at work.", "language": "en", "text": "Trump\u2019s rally at the BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Miss., next week lands him in the state with the most total lynchings of blacks from 1882 to 1968, according to the NAACP. Over that time span, 581 lynchings took place in Mississippi; more than 90 percent of victims were African American.\n\nTrump\u2019s rally, to be held four days before Magnolia State voters elect a governor, is aimed at boosting the turnout of his mainly white \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d crowd and getting some adulation for himself. He has done that before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump was in Mississippi a year ago to stump for Republican Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith, who was seeking the seat Sen. Thad Cochran vacated in 2018 because of health issues. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies and roundtable event did Hyde-Smith some good. She made it to the Senate with an eight-point victory margin over Democrat Mike Espy, who would have become Mississippi\u2019s first black U.S. senator since Reconstruction. Trump helped her along by telling Mississippians that a vote for Espy was a vote for \u201csocialism and open borders.\u201d\n\nThere were, by the way, things about Hyde-Smith that rubbed some Mississippians, especially blacks voters, the wrong way. Like when she told one supporter that she was so fond of him that \u201cif he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t think it was much of a joke when video appeared showing Hyde-Smith telling a small crowd in Starkville, Miss., that \u201cthey remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJokes about hanging and voter suppression don\u2019t go over well with African Americans living in a state with such an ugly racial history.\n\nBut Hyde-Smith went over well with Trump, so he went all out for her.\n\nJust as he is going all out for himself now with his faux self-portrayal as a lynching victim.\n\nTrump knows the difference.\n\nIn February 2017, he visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. He also toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson in December 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to visit those museums and not take away the story of the 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, visiting Mississippi from Chicago, by white men who used barbed wire to tie a cotton gin fan around his neck and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River. Or the 1964 ambushing and killing of three civil rights workers \u2014 Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman \u2014 who were trying to register voters near the town of Philadelphia, Miss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump knows better. He also knows that he is in a world of trouble.\n\nWhat better way to cope with what\u2019s beleaguering him in Washington than to get out of town and take the stage down south where he can bask in the roar of an adoring crowd. Presenting himself as a victim of mob vigilantism endears him all the more to his base.\n\nThat ploy might work for Trump in Mississippi. But it gets him nowhere in our nation\u2019s capital, where he\u2019s cornered by the Constitution.\n\nThere is no ritualized execution taking place in the House of Representatives. At work is a constitutionally approved inquiry into whether Trump has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors through the abuse of his authority, gross dishonesty, lawbreaking and engaging in conduct unbecoming of a president of the United States.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s not a public lynching of Donald Trump. On display is nothing less than a nation of laws at work.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Trump can\u2019t make it stop. Now that must be torture for him.\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump knows better.
