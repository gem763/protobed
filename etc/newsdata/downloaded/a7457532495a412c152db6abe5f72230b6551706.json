His manager Graham Potter has described him as a \u201cdetermined little so-and-so\u201d and, as Connolly learned when he first joined Brighton three years ago, persistence pays off in football.\n\nThe young Irishman had shown plenty of promise at Mervue United in Galway, leading to a trial at Brighton when he was 16. According to John Morling, Brighton\u2019s academy manager, he did \u201cOK\u201d. Not bad enough to be immediately rejected, but not good enough to be accepted.\n\n\u201cHe had to come in again,\u201d says Morling. \u201cAnd he did much better the second time. We offered to sign him and he joined as a scholar in the under-18s. He has got pace, he is hard to play against and he scores a range of goals. He has always been a threat.\u201d Connolly\u2019s achievement in becoming the first Irish teenager to score twice in a Premier League game since Robbie Keane in 1999 led to a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad, with manager Mick McCarthy saying ahead of today\u2019s meeting with Georgia that it was no gamble to select a player who has made just one Premier League start.\n\nOn an individual level, Connolly\u2019s sudden rise is testament to the set-up at Brighton and the faith shown in young players by Potter. The entire club has a part to play, Morling says, from the coaches and canteen staff to the player care department and psychologists. It is a team effort which, every now and then, leads to a triumph. \u201cLots of players have potential,\u201d says Morling. \u201cIt is about ensuring they get the right opportunities at the right time.\u201d\n\nOn a wider level, Connolly\u2019s eye-catching debut provided a reminder of the talent that can be found in Ireland after years of dwindling numbers in England\u2019s top flight. Last season only 15 Irish players featured in the Premier League, the lowest since it was formed in 1992. Between then and 2013, the average number of Irish players in the top flight was twice what it is now.", "description": "It was fitting that Aaron Connolly\u2019s first Premier League goal came at the second attempt, a prodded shot bobbling into Tottenham\u2019s net after his first shot had been saved.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212062592-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqG-M58k8MRku3BNn43p0jOa2IF33SYoEwAkeedgbVSbs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
