Each time Henry snuck into his parents\u2019 bedroom to puzzle over this snapshot as if it were a clue to his future, he remarked that the fish, like his uncle, was long dead, while the dock and cottage were still there at the water\u2019s edge, awaiting them every summer like a stage set \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry, Himself\u201d is the new novel by Stewart O\u2019Nan about Henry Maxwell, his wife Emily, his family and his dog Rufus, but the focus is on Henry himself, his everyday existence, his thoughts, emotions and contemplation of the past.\n\nMr. O\u2019Nan has written two earlier novels about the Maxwell family, first \u201cWish You Were Here,\u201d which takes place after Henry\u2019s death, and \u201cEmily Alone,\u201d wherein Emily discovers strength and independence. It is not necessary to be acquainted with the Maxwell family before enjoying \u201cHenry, Himself,\u201d as this novel stands by itself.\n\nLike Mr. O\u2019Nan, Henry is a Pittsburgher. He is 74 years old, a retiree, subject to all the minor ills of old age, and living a gentle life of private pleasures with Emily and Rufus. He has been a solider, engineer, husband and father. He knows how to deal with Emily and loves her, is dependent on her practical soul and affection for him. His daughter, Margaret, is a puzzle to him. She drinks too much, is (or perhaps is not) divorcing her husband. He loves her and he loves his son, Kenny, and their grandchildren, although neither he nor Emily have much affection for their daughter-in-law.\n\nThere is a wistful tenderness to \u201cHenry, Himself.\u201d Its charm lies in the low-key tone of the novel, beautifully written in vignettes, about the inner life of an aging man, and the everyday events that, in the course of a year, color his life. Henry and Emily tend to their garden, drive to Chautauqua, purchase a new suit, go to a funeral, buy pumpkins, deal with mice in the house, prepare for Henry\u2019s 75th birthday and their upcoming 50th wedding anniversary. There are countless trips to the grocery and hardware stores.\n\nThe Maxwells still go to the cottage in Chautauqua every summer, as they have ever since Henry\u2019s childhood. \u201cAs an engineer, he had a respect for the practical that extended to every facet of living, and was happiest when he saw an opportunity to fix a problem. Not everything could be perfected, but his natural inclination \u2014 with machines or systems \u2014 was to look for design flaws and ways to eliminate them.\u201d Henry has a list of projects to be done by the family when they gather at the cottage, and as in earlier days, he likes to sit on the dock and reminisce and daydream, sometimes about his first, passionate love, Sloan.\n\n\u201cLazy summer afternoons, as heat and the scent of baking tarpaper gathered in the rafters, Henry would look up from the day\u2019s project to watch the grandchildren swimming off the dock or the Chautauqua Belle steaming past or a majestic procession of clouds and savor the rightness of life, nodding to himself as if it were a secret. Somehow it was.\n\n\u201cLate in life, after his mother had died, his father cried at baptisms and funerals and sappy movies on TV, age stripping away a final protective layer. Now Henry could feel the same softening taking place inside him of helpless grief for the past and boundless pity for the world, and that was right too. No fool like an old fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Henry, grief, like love, was a private matter. He had no use for parades or speeches or moments of silence. He didn\u2019t need a special occasion to recall the dead. They came to him unbidden \u2014 the gunner of the drowned tank, his bloated face wavering inches below the surface like a curious fish. The bodies on the road like so many piles of laundry.\u201d\n\nHe shared his life with Emily \u201cthe scrappy small-town girl,\u201d his parents had hoped \u201cmight exorcise the ghost of Sloan. \u2026 Henry could see his mother\u2019s influence in Emily\u2019s preference for pearls and silver jewelry rather than showy gold and diamonds. \u2026\u201d They have been happy together but not without friction; with Emily, \u201ceverything was personal, bound up in history. There was always some ulterior motive at play.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cHenry, Himself\u201d is not a great novel, its quiet, witty charm is quite wonderful, each vignette a pleasure to read. \u201cHis mother had taught [Henry] to eat everything on his plate and not complain, advice he\u2019d followed, for better or worse, his whole life.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Corinna Lothar is a Washington writer, critic and frequent contributor to The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nHENRY, HIMSELF\n\nBy Stewart O\u2019Nan\n\nViking, $27, 369 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
