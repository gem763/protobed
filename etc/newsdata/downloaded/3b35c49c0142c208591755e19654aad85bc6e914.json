Initially, she wasn\u2019t eligible for parole until 2055. However, in January, Tennessee\u2019s then-governor, Bill Haslam (R), granted her executive clemency so that she could be freed.\n\nBrown-Long\u2019s case had sparked public calls for her release, even attracting attention from such celebrities as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna, who advocated for her freedom.\n\nWhile behind bars, Brown-Long earned a high school diploma and then an associate degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Nashville\u2019s Lipscomb University, married Christian hip hop artist Jamie Long, and wrote a memoir, \u201cFree Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System,\u201d which hit store shelves on Tuesday.\n\nNow, for the first time as an adult, Brown-Long is establishing her life outside prison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d she told \u201cToday.\u201d \u201cI get to wake up every day, decide what I want to do with my day, get to be with my husband, get to be with my family. It\u2019s just being free.\u201d", "description": "As a 16-year-old sex trafficking victim, Brown-Long said she shot Johnny Mitchell Allen in fear for her life.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da60578200000b00c50397b.jpeg?cache=s0ryzqtvsz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
