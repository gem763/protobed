Burritos include \u201cNo Collusion\u201d (carne asada, cilantro lime rice, black beans) and \u201cThe Stormy\u201d (carne adovada, Mexican rice, and pinto beans), and \u201cFake News,\u201d which is a chipotle chicken taco.\n\nLocals had some things to say about the menu. \u201cI think he\u2019s purposefully trying to court controversy,\u201d a man told news station KOAT Action News.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not offensive,\u201d a woman told the station. \u201cI just think it\u2019s interesting that they decided to be so bold with the names.\u201d\n\nThe Urban Taqueria, a Mexican restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico offers a newsworthy menu.

In fact, he says they're a \u201cconversation starter\u201d and educational by nature.\n\n\u201cOutsourced,\u201d a taco with tandoori chicken, raita, tamarind salsa, alludes to the U.S. practice of outsourcing jobs to India, while \u201cThe Immigrant,\u201d a vegan taco with organic green chile and fried potatoes, represents Irish refugees fleeing the Potato Famine in the 1800s.\n\nBut Patricia Perea, a professor at the University of New Mexico, who holds a PhD in American Studies, told KOAT Action News that the menu is divisive.\n\nThe menu at new Mexican restaurant in New Mexico gets political.

You're offending a whole community,\" she told KOAT. \"It's normalizing the terms and potentially turning them into funny or humorous terms, and the more that you do that, the more likely people are to repeat them and perhaps forget the contexts in which they were said.\"\n\nMohamed tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the names of his dishes dictate sales. \u201cI have a regular customer who loves \u201cThe Republicans,\u201d but can\u2019t say the name,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I tell him, order the grilled pork tacos.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant recently introduced \u201cThe Mueller\u201d and will lengthen its menu in the coming months. Says Mohamed, \u201cWe\u2019ll be monitoring the news in November.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The Mexican restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico says the dishes are conversation starters.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qkf5iNDlVr0USHx.OjgUAg--~B/aD01MzMyO3c9NzE0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d244aa40-cf66-11e9-aecf-4bb6262c1f8f"}
