It will streamline its corporate structure into two business units, North America and Europe. It will seek to bring new drinks to market faster and invest in its digital capabilities. As part of the changes, the company will be renamed Molson Coors Beverages Company effective January of 2020. The company expects to generate cost savings of about $150 million and to book charges for severance, employee relocation and personnel changes of $120 million to $180 million, spread over fiscal 2020 and 2021. The company will further streamline its global, MillerCoors and MCI leadership team into one team, effective Nov. 1. The company announced the overhaul as it posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings. It posted a loss of $402.8 million, or $1.86 a share, for the quarter, after earnings of $338.3 million, or $1.56 a share, in the year-earlier period. The loss was due to a goodwill charge of $692 million, related to its Canada unit. The decline was also due to \"lower volume, inflation and cycling the favorable resolution of a vendor dispute in the U.S., partially offset by positive global pricing and mix, cost savings and lower incentive compensation, restructuring charges and marketing spend,\" said the statement. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.48, below the $1.51 FactSet consensus. Sales fell to $2.842 billion from $2.934 billion, also below the FactSet consensus of $2.866 billion.
