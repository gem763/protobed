Hearing the official diagnosis was devastating,\" he wrote in the tweet. \"But just as painful for me was the realization that the signs were there all along \u2014 I had just been overlooking them.\"\n\nMy mom has Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 and I missed the signs.\n\n\n\nRead (and learn from) my mom's story: https://t.co/eOFHrMqwtE #EndAlz pic.twitter.com/aLn2yReA10 \u2014 Dr. Mehmet Oz (@DrOz) September 9, 2019\n\nThe official \"Doctor Oz\" YouTube channel uploaded a video of Oz sharing what he would tell other people about Alzheimer's.\n\n\"It's a chameleon of a disease. It's slippery,\" he said. \"It's like a snake in the grass, you can see the grass moving but you can't quite tell what it is. And you don't want to admit it because it's too painful.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The idea that you would lose, which is how I feel now, I'm going to lose my mom twice. She's already disappearing. Wisps of her memory are evaporating in front of me.\"\n\nOz also wrote an article for his namesake show's site, expanding on his feelings that \"the biggest lies are the ones we tell ourselves.\"\n\nYasin Aras/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHe called Alzheimer's \"one of the most feared diseases that currently affects at least 5 million people in the U.S.\" which is \"expected to nearly triple by 2060.\"\n\nOz also shared six early symptoms that people should never ignore.\n\n\"Challenges in planning, difficulty completing tasks, confusing time and place, problems with words, trouble understanding visuals, misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps,\" he listed in the article.\n\nHe also wrote about a comprehensive testing approach and his plan of action for his own health, but ended with a deeply personal message.\n\n\"The biggest lies are the ones we tell ourselves. It was painful to admit that my mother\u2019s health was declining, but doing so allowed us to get her help as soon as possible,\" Oz shared. \"You have the power to speak up and say something if you suspect any of the above symptoms in a loved one. Doing so may be uncomfortable, but it just might help slow down the Alzheimer\u2019s progression in someone you love.\"", "description": "TV host Dr. Oz penned a full article opening up about his mom's Alzheimer's diagnosis and how it impacted him.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/dr-oz-1-gty-er-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
