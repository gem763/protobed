Here's what it's like to play.", "language": "en", "text": "The newly released Mario Kart Tour is Nintendo's biggest mobile game launch ever, with more than 20 million downloads in a single day, based on data from SensorTower.\n\nMario Kart Tour changes the series' classic formula a bit, introducing touch controls and microtransactions.\n\nThe game manages to capture most of the fun the series is known for, but unlocking new drivers and courses can feel like a grind.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMore than 20 million players downloaded Mario Kart Tour when it launched on September 25, making it Nintendo's most popular mobile launch ever. The game's rolling start shouldn't come as a surprise \u2014 Mario Kart is Nintendo's best-selling game on multiple consoles and Mario Kart Tour is free to install on iPhone and Android.\n\nIn comparison, Nintendo's Super Mario Run had 7 million downloads during its first day on the App Store, and Nintendo's highest-grossing mobile title, \"Fire Emblem Heroes,\" had 1.8 million downloads on launch day, according to data from SensorTower.\n\nWhile Mario Kart Tour features the same memorable characters and race tracks from the console games, the game has been redesigned to work on a touch screen and incorporates some popular monetization methods used by other free mobile games.\n\nIn Mario Kart Tour, your car moves forward automatically and you can steer left and right using the touch screen. Mario Kart Tour won't let you fall off the course like the classic games, so the controls aren't too hard to manage. You'll play against seven computer-controlled opponents in a series of races; a multiplayer mode is planned for a future update.\n\n\"Mario Kart Tour\"/Nintendo\n\nNintendo offered an early look at Mario Kart Tour to a select number of players in May, but the game has changed a bit since then. During that beta test, players had a time limit and would eventually need to spend money to lengthen their play sessions.\n\nRead more: The man behind 'Mario Kart' addresses the game's divisive blue shell: 'Sometimes life isn't fair'\n\nThe time limit has been removed in the final version of the game, but a lot of the game's drivers and races still need to be unlocked. Unlocking all of the rewards would take hours of grinding away at the game, but you can also spend cash to unlock things faster. From the way Mario Kart Tour is set up, it seems like Nintendo wants you to spend as much as you can afford.\n\nFirst, there's a $5 monthly \"Gold Pass\" that gives you access to the fastest races and more rewards. Then, you can buy \"rubies\" in packs costing up to $70 for a chance to unlock random items. Finally, the game offers a set of items that can be purchased every two weeks for $20.\n\nThere are ways to unlock items without spending money, but hours of effort will only lead to a handful of rewards. Nintendo knows some people will definitely be willing to embrace the microtransactions, and the game grossed more than $1 million in its first day, according to data from SensorTower.\n\nMario Kart Tour is still a fun way to pass the time, but the constant grind to unlock the characters and races I want make it less enjoyable than the original games.\n\nHere's a closer look at how Mario Kart Tour works:", "description": "Mario Kart Tour redesigns the series with easy touch controls and microtransactions, and there are already millions of people playing", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e36cf2e22af77661e44f3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
