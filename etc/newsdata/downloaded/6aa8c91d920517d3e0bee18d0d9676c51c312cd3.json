Locations in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Fort Myers, Florida, currently are under development, and several additional sites are planned for 2020 and beyond.

The ball transmits scores electronically to the custom PopStroke app, which can be downloaded in the Apple and Android App stores. Players will be able to compete against each other in a tournament environment while earning \"Pop Bucks\" through the PopStroke loyalty rewards app program.\n\n\"Some of my happiest memories are spending time with my pops (Earl) on the golf course having putting contests,\" Woods said. \"I'm looking forward to others enjoying time with their kids at PopStroke. This is a new way for individuals to experience the game of golf. It's about bringing people together.\"\n\nSome of my happiest memories are spending time with my pops on the golf course having putting contests.
