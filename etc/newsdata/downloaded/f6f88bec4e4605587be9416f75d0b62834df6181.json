Woke: Make the invitations", "language": "en", "text": "Here\u2019s a piece of news that slipped under my radar yesterday but we might as well tackle it today. You\u2019re likely already familiar with the baker who went back and forth in court with people trying to force him to bake a cake for a gay wedding. The Supreme Court eventually found in his favor, though narrowly. In August, the Eighth Circuit ruled that the same situation applied to a photographer who similarly objected to providing services.\n\nNow, as David French reports at National Review, yet another court has taken a similar stand when it comes to another artistic endeavor. The state Supreme Court of Arizona has ruled in favor of a pair of calligraphers and painters who create custom wedding invitations.\n\nToday, the Arizona Supreme Court reached a similar holding, this time on behalf of Christian calligraphers and painters Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski. The case, brought by my friends and former colleagues at the Alliance Defending Freedom, is similar to multiple other wedding vendor cases. The plaintiffs do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation (they happily serve gay customers). They merely refuse to produce art that advances ideas they find objectionable. Duka and Koski operate a limited liability company called \u201cBrush & Nib Studios.\u201d The company\u2019s Operating Agreement declares its beliefs quite clearly \u2014 stating that it will not create \u201ccustom artwork that communicates ideas or messages . . . that contradict biblical truth, demean others, endorse racism, incite violence, or promote any marriage besides marriage between one man and one woman, such as same-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve written here more times than I can count, I\u2019m not among those who object to gay marriage. I strongly believe that the government should not be in the business of telling people who can or can\u2019t get married (with exceptions for the underage or those incapable of giving informed consent) or demanding licenses and charging fees for the privilege of doing so. Besides, having been to a couple of gay weddings now, I can assure you that the food and gifts are generally fabulous. But I digress.\n\nAt the same time, however, I have also maintained that nobody should be forced to participate in a wedding celebration if it conflicts with their deeply held views. That\u2019s the test I would apply to this case. Baking and decorating a custom cake is an act of participation. The cake is a physical totem used during the reception. It\u2019s art.\n\nCan we say the same about invitations? If they were generic, cookie-cutter invitation being sold at Walmart and the clerk refused to sell them to two lesbians who were tying the knot I would say certainly not and the store should be held accountable. But this duo creates custom invitations through painting and the art of calligraphy. Again\u2026 it\u2019s art. But is it \u201cpart of the ceremony\u201d like the cake is? Um\u2026 I guess so? At least the court felt that way.\n\nIn all of these cases that arise, I find myself coming back to the same point. Why do these couples seek out these specific providers and demand that they and only they will be suitable to serve them? The industry supporting weddings in America is brutally competitive. Virtually anywhere you go you will find hordes of people eager to take your money exchange for all of the goods and services a wedding requires. And at the risk of overly generalizing, it\u2019s a pretty gay-friendly environment if you know what I mean.\n\nInsisting that someone with a moral objection provide your goods and services when you could so easily find those services elsewhere seems mean-spirited at best. Perhaps the courts are taking that into consideration as well as the entire forced speech concern.", "description": "But they are apparently the same", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/invitations.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
