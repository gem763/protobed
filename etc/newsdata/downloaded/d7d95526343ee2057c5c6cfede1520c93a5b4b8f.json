Johnson said he would put it to a vote on Tuesday.\n\nLetwin\u2019s amendment proposed that a decision on whether to back a Brexit deal be deferred until all the legislation needed to implement it has been passed through parliament.\n\nEven though Johnson believes this can be achieved by Oct. 31, others think it would need a short \u2018technical\u2019 delay in Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.\n\nA law passed by Johnson\u2019s opponents obliges him to ask the EU for a Brexit delay until Jan. 31, 2020 if he could not secure approval for his deal by the end of Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds,\u201d Letwin said earlier. But he wanted \u201can insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation\u201d.\n\nThree years after Britain voted 52-48% to leave the European project, Johnson struck a divorce deal with the bloc in Brussels on Thursday.", "description": "A defiant Boris Johnson said he would not negotiate a further delay to Britain's departure from the European Union after parliament voted on Saturday to postpone a vote on his Brexit deal.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442629448&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I085", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
