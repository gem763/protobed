Covenant\u2019s president, Stephen Grubbs, and St. Mary\u2019s Health System president Steven Jorgenson told the paper in a statement that they 'deeply regret that this situation occurred.'\n\nFormer lab technician's assistant Mykayla McCann said that her own records were accessed and the workplace became intolerable - she later complained to the Human Rights Commission that found that the hospital discriminated against her\n\nThe Commission's investigator did not find reasonable grounds to believe the hospital retaliated against McCann for complaining about discrimination\n\nMcCann said initially she kept quiet about the offensive collage because she was a new hire at the time and worried that, being herself a person with a disability, she might become the object of ridicule among her colleagues and end up on the 'wall of shame,' according to the human rights commission's report.\n\nA year later, she took some time off work to seek medical treatment for her unspecified condition at a different hospital, specifically to protect her privacy from her prying co-workers.\n\nWhen McCann returned to work, she said she noticed that her colleagues were treating her differently, and some began asking her personal questions about her medical history, such as, 'Do you drink a lot?'; 'Do you party a lot?' and 'Do you drink and drive?'\n\nThis line of inquiry led McCann to suspect that someone had accessed her file without her consent.\n\nIn September 2016, McCann took her concerns to her supervisor and complained of being subjected to harassment. At that time, she also raised the alarm about the \u2018wall of shame.'\n\nFour months later, St Mary's fired one lab technician and reprimanded another for accessing McCann's electronic medical records.\n\nDuring the subsequent human rights investigation, there was a disagreement about the timeline of the wall of shame's removal, with the hospital claiming that it was taken down within weeks, and McCann insisting that it stayed up for three or four months after she first complained about it.\n\nThe commission noted that McCann provided credible evidence in the from of a time-stamped photograph showing the demeaning collage still up as late as December 26, 2016.\n\nThe commission investigator found the delay 'unacceptable.'\n\n\u2018The information posted on Shame Wall was intended to demean and humiliate and included supposed \u201cjokes\u201d about the hospital\u2019s physically and mentally disabled patients,\u2019 the final report stated.\n\nAccording to the findings of the commission, it took the hospital three or four months to remove the demeaning display mocking disabled patients\n\nMcCann resigned her position in January 2017, saying her workplace was 'intolerable,' and the following month she filed the complain with the state Human Rights Commission.\n\nAfter looking into McCann\u2019s claims, the investigator found that St. Mary\u2019s Hospital discriminated against her, being a member of a protected class as a person with a disability, when it subjected her to a hostile work environment.\n\nHowever, the investigator did not find reasonable grounds to believe the hospital retaliated against McCann for complaining about discrimination.\n\nPresident of St. Mary's Health System Steven Jorgensen and President of Covenant Health Stephen Grubbs issued an apology on Thursday, saying their company \u2018does not tolerate or condone discrimination or harassment of any kind, for any reason.\u2019\n\nIn their statement, however, the administrators insisted that the hospital \u2018took immediate action\u2019 to look into and address McCann\u2019s concerns, and discipline the guilty parties.", "description": "The Maine Human Rights Commission has found that employees of St Mary's Regional Medical Center in Lewiston created a display meant to demean patients by poking fun at their ailments.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303984-0-image-a-2_1570204390666.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
