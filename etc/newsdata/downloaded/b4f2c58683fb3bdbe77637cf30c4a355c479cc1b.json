Known for the being the location of the Spice Girls\u2019 first-ever live concert in 1997, Girl Power! Live In Istanbul sponsored by Pepsi.\n\nRosi\u2019s trip \u2013 organised for Maeva\u2019s birthday \u2013 is underway. Maeva, somewhat ungratefully, wishes she and James weren\u2019t there with other people \u2013 specifically Verity, who she revealed last week she doesn\u2019t trust.\n\nSam \u2013 whose biceps are growing by the second - has been invited, but new Love Island girlfriend Zara doesn\u2019t appear to have been asked [but that's okay because he buys her Cartier later in the episode, so all is well].\n\nUngrateful: Rosi\u2019s trip \u2013 organised for Maeva\u2019s birthday \u2013 is underway. Maeva, somewhat ungratefully, wishes she and James weren\u2019t there with other people\n\nHarry declares that Jamie is a 'c**k\u2019 and says that Sam would be a \u2018t**t\u2019 if he made friends with him again. Jamie, meanwhile, cannot stick the fact that he hasn't been forgiven yet and is obsessively texting Sam as if he were Rebekah Vardy trying to wipe her Sent Messages outbox.\n\nDespite Maeva openly announcing she does not care for Verity, James is enjoying an intimate rooftop picnic with her, overlooking the Istanbul skyline.\n\nDressed like a Turkish queen, Maeva floats up to the roof to un-subtly suggest that the pair of them are looking somewhat romantic. This is laughed off - for now.\n\nHarry and Melissa go for a Turkish bath/rub-down/massage/wash/healing session. Melissa enjoys it so much she becomes a bit spaced out and inadvertently suggests she and Harry invite the masseuse back for a threesome.\n\nLady in blue: Sophie wants to pay homage to Yves Klein by splattering her body in blue paint and rolling around on a blank canvas\n\nSophie wants to pay homage to Yves Klein by splattering her body in blue paint and rolling around on a blank canvas.\n\nShe enlists Liv to take photographs of this, while Fred gets 'all up in her angles' with the blue paint.\n\nIt's empowering, it's graceful - it's better than Kendall Jenner.\n\nBecause Zara was not allowed on the Turkey trip, Sam is flitting between Rosi and Verity to pass the time.\n\nChilling: Despite Maeva openly announcing she does not care for Verity, James is enjoying an intimate rooftop picnic with her, overlooking the Istanbul skyline\n\nVerity - despite comparing Sam to Mr Tumnus from The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe - proves to be the most interesting of the two as she reveals that James has been doing all the flirting again.\n\nApparently, James cuddled her in the night the other evening, but she didn't cuddle him back. Still, she feels guilt-ridden because she hasn't told Maeva and feels she has 'developed a good friendship' with her.\n\nAs she says this, Maeva is declaring that 'the guest list is s**t' on this trip.\n\nBack in London, Freddie is examining Mark Francis' 18th Century moulds.\n\nWhen he hangs out with Mark, Freddie gets even posher. The posh level is so high that the moulds are practically rattling in their display casings.\n\nRosi finds out that James shared a bed with Verity and cuddled her and breaks the news to Maeva who just can't believe what she's hearing.\n\nWhat we've all learned from this is that it would probably be best if she just left James on the \u2018no thanks\u2019 pile, next to Miles. On the plus side, she's really softened lately. Devastation will do that to you.\n\nPowerful: Meanwhile, Sophie enlists Liv to take photographs of this, while Fred gets 'all up in her angles' with the blue paint. It's empowering, it's graceful - it's better than Kendall Jenner\n\nMaeva confronts James and Verity - yet again, on a roof - about the cuddling.\n\n'Did you cuddle him back?' she asks Verity, who replies with a resounding scoff.\n\n'You\u2019re a liar!' James barks at her, his tanned face not helping Maeva in her attempts to resist him.\n\nMytton is just a wonderful man and is hosting a coffee morning for the Macmillan nurses.\n\nRather inappropriately, Jamie chooses this event to speak to Sam about their ever-floundering friendship.\n\nSam explains that he's humiliated and can\u2019t go back to the way he and Sam used to be. It's all he can do to stop himself chucking Mark Francis' Harrods-bought cake in Jamie's face.", "description": "Rosi's trip - organised for Maeva's birthday - is underway.
