The thousands of Britons who take to their local green space each week for a mass five km (3.11 mile) parkrun can expect to reap health benefits well beyond losing a few pounds and lowering their blood pressure. Scientists who have studied the mass participation events, which from a small start in London 10 years ago next week have grown to attract some 70,000 runners a week worldwide, say their effect on psychological and physical health is starting to show.

One of the most recent participants, Japan, launched its first parkrun event in Tokyo in April this year, making it the 21st country to join.\n\nMeanwhile, parkrun Russia started in two simultaneous events in Moscow in March, 2014, and there is now a weekly event in Siberia, where organisers have pledged never to let snow, ice or cold weather force them to cancel.\n\nIn Africa, runners in the tiny country of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and in South Africa\u2019s vast cities and grasslands are also regulars.\n\nThe combined achievement so far stands at more than 260 million kilometres of running, taking 3,118 years, 25 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes and 18 seconds.\n\nIn thousands of testimonials sent to the organisers, parkrunners say it has made them fitter, happier and healthier.\n\n\u201cAs I struggled up the hill a marshal shouted out that I \u2018looked strong\u2019 and that I \u2018could do this\u2019 and I was overwhelmed by her kindness,\u201d said Gail Seal, a British mother of two who took more than a year to find the courage to do her first parkrun event but has now clocked up more than 100.\n\n\u201cParkrun has genuinely changed my life for the better, not just from the new friends I\u2019ve made, but I\u2019ve never felt so fit and healthy as I do now.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, parkrun has teamed up with the esteemed Royal College of General Practitioners to encourage family doctors to prescribe the social weekly run to patients to help improve both mental and physical health.\n\nOf the almost 2,000 individual parkruns each week in 21 countries, 25 are now in prisons - 18 in the UK, two in Ireland and five in Australia - where inmates and staff often run multiple laps of an exercise yard to reach 5km.\n\nNext week will see another landmark - with parkrun starting its inaugural UK all-female prison event, following the launch of one in Australia.\n\nCOMPETITIVE COMPARISONS\n\nThe fastest worldwide recorded time was set in 2012 at parkrun\u2019s birthplace in Bushy Park, south-west London, by British Olympian Andy Baddeley, who covered the grassy 5km course in 13 minutes, 48 seconds.\n\nCharlotte Arter set the best women\u2019s mark of 15 minutes and 50 seconds in Cardiff in January this year.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut parkrun organisers, who are keen to avoid putting people off with competitive comparisons and who are delighted for people to walk, do not have a record of the slowest time.\n\nMore important and valuable, they say, are data showing that more than half of parkrunners are women, and that as the number of participants rises, so too do average finishing times. It helps to underline parkrun\u2019s appeal for millions of people who would never before had considered themselves runners.\n\n(This story refiles the earlier story and removes reference to survey in final two paragraphs)", "description": "The global running phenomenon that is parkrun turns 15 on Wednesday with six million people worldwide now signed up to a community that began as a meeting of 13 friends for a sociable Saturday run in a London park.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435936191&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9031J", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
