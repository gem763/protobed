Michael Ondaatje, a former winner of the award, is one of the signatories to the letter.\n\nThe judges had initially chosen Shamsie for writing that \u201cbuilds bridges between societies\u201d, but changed their minds on learning she backed the BDS movement, saying that her \u201cpolitical positioning to actively participate in the cultural boycott \u2026 contrasts with the claim of the Nelly Sachs prize to proclaim and exemplify reconciliation among peoples and cultures\u201d.\n\nShamsie\u2019s supporters reply asks: \u201cWhat is the meaning of a literary award that undermines the right to advocate for human rights, the principles of freedom of conscience and expression and the freedom to criticise? \u2026 Without these, art and culture become meaningless luxuries.\u201d\n\nThe letter had more than 100 signatories a day after it began to be circulated by the writers Ahdaf Soueif and Omar Robert Hamilton, co-founders of the Palestine festival of literature.\n\nThe revoking of Shamsie\u2019s award follows a motion passed in May by the German parliament that labelled the BDS movement antisemitic. But the letter writers point to a decision earlier this month in the administrative court of Cologne ruling that Bonn city council\u2019s decision to exclude the German-Palestinian Women\u2019s Association from a cultural festival because of its support for BDS was unjustified.\n\nThe writers highlight the statement last year from more than 40 progressive Jewish organisations arguing that conflating anti-Jewish racism with opposition to Israel\u2019s policies and system of occupation and apartheid \u201cundermines both the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality and the global struggle against antisemitism\u201d.\n\nThe letter also criticises the German city of Dortmund, which runs the award, for refusing to make public Shamsie\u2019s written response to the decision.\n\nShamsie, winner of the UK\u2019s Women\u2019s prize for fiction, had called it a \u201cmatter of outrage that the BDS movement (modelled on the South African boycott) that campaigns against the government of Israel for its acts of discrimination and brutality against Palestinians should be held up as something shameful and unjust\u201d.\n\nAsked to comment, a spokeswoman for the city of Dortmund said that the jury had decided not to give any further statements. \u201cThe council has legitimated the jury of Nelly Sachs prize to choose an awardee,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jury is autonomous in its decision and gave reasons in the press release. There has been no council meeting after the jury\u2019s decision, so the withdrawal has not been a topic for the council yet.\u201d", "description": "Nelly Sachs prize was withdrawn over Shamsie\u2019s support for boycotting Israel, prompting more than 250 fellow writers to defend her stance", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33024e12bcbea7a9862322faba95feebd05e9b0e/2092_398_4582_2749/master/4582.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fec338616756ba1a5e6d87db9d5ff324", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
