We\u2019ve always had a close relationship, unlike the non-existent one we have with our sister who is eight years older than us.\n\nShe has never married and always lived with our father. She treated us as if we don\u2019t exist.\n\nFortunately, we had a good relationship with our father and live-in nanny.\n\nHe once told us he and mother didn\u2019t think they could have more children, so our sister was expected to be an only child and was spoilt.\n\nBut then we came along and, sadly, mother died giving birth. It had a bad effect on our sister and she blamed us.\n\nWe tried and failed to build a relationship with her over the years. Then six months ago our father fell seriously ill and she failed to let us know. When he found out, he was very upset.\n\nHe passed away three months ago and we found he\u2019d changed his will, selling the house and sharing the profits between my twin and me.\n\nOur older sister got a bungalow he owned on the coast. Now she\u2019s contacted us, via our aunt, wanting a relationship. We\u2019re in two minds whether she genuinely wants to make up for the past.\n\nColeen says\n\nPart of me feels so heartbroken for your sister because you\u2019ve always had each other. She had eight years of being with your mum and dad, and feeling cherished, and then you come along and her mum dies. At eight, that\u2019s very damaging.\n\nI imagine when you were born there were a lot of people helping with you and your twin, and she might have felt pushed out while coming to terms with the fact her mum had gone. She may have felt pushed out and very alone all her life.\n\nI\u2019m not agreeing with the way she\u2019s behaved towards you two, but I can see there\u2019s a reason for it. She must have had a very strong bond with your dad and, now he\u2019s gone, she wants to connect to her family.\n\nI\u2019m sure she realises what happened to your mum isn\u2019t your fault, but I imagine she has lots of resentment she\u2019s never dealt with.\n\nSo if you can find empathy to meet her and start a dialogue, accepting she\u2019s had a difficult life, it would be a good thing.\n\nShe is going to be damaged by what happened \u2013 that little lost eight-year-old is still in there. You and your twin will always have each other, so find forgiveness and kindness in your hearts and reach out to her. She hasn\u2019t made this about your dad\u2019s will \u2013 she wants a relationship with you.\n\nIf you can do this, down the line it might be best for you all to have family counselling where you can hopefully understand each other better.", "description": "\"We tried and failed to build a relationship with her over the years.
