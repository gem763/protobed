Ask anyone who\u2019s done it, and they\u2019ll probably tell you that it\u2019s not just about the money\u2014it\u2019s about the pressure we face around this time of year to buy big, flashy gifts for our loved ones.\n\nFrom targeted ads to gift guides filled with the latest electronics and other insanely expensive gadgets, we get bombarded with content in the weeks leading up to the holidays that all seem to point toward the same message: spending a small fortune on presents is the only way to show someone you really care. And while that\u2019s definitely not true, the stress of trying to find the perfect present for a friend, partner, or family member can get to you eventually.\n\nMore: 15 gifts on everyone\u2019s Amazon wish list this year\n\nThe good news?
