I took her out; I took her to baseball games, events that we were both invited to from a public personality aspect.\u201d\n\nSAVANNAH CHRISLEY SAYS SHE'LL 'NEVER FORGIVE' SISTER LINDSIE OVER EXTORTION ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TODD\n\nHe added, \u201cWe never got to that committal stage, and part of that was she\u2019s got her life out there with her kid and her ex-husband. I enjoyed spending time with her but we never got to that. \u2026 We haven\u2019t been sexually active with each other in two years, but back then we had a fling.\u201d\n\nLindsie alleged that father Todd, 50, and her brother, Chase, tried to extort her with a sex video of her and Hayes that was reportedly captured on a friend's puppy cam. She claimed that if she did not provide an alibi for the Chrisleys' current tax woes, they threatened to release the footage.\n\n'BACHELORETTE' STAR ROBBY HAYES BREAKS SILENCE ON ALLEGED LINDSIE CHRISLEY SEX VIDEO\n\nShe filed a police report about the allegations and is reportedly working with the FBI on investigating the accusations.\n\nLast month, the \"Chrisley Knows Best\" star and wife Julie pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of tax evasion and fraud charges and were released on $100,000 bonds.\n\nIf convicted of all counts, the reality personalities would face up to 30 years each behind bars.\n\nTODD CHRISLEY ACCUSED OF EXTORTING DAUGHTER WITH SEX TAPE\n\nThe family previously pinned the allegations on a disgruntled former employee, whom they accused of stealing from them before his firing. There was initial speculation that the family was allegedly extorting daughter Lindsie in connection with the tax evasion charges, but she has denied any involvement.\n\nTodd previously denied Lindsie's allegations in a statement to Fox News in which he exposed Lindsie's alleged dalliances with Hayes and Josh Murray: \"It\u2019s heartbreaking and shameful that these kinds of accusations have to be aired in public. We have tried to keep Lindsie\u2019s extramarital relationships with Robby Hayes and Josh Murray private for her sake since August of 2016. Sadly, for reasons we can only guess at, she ran to the sheriff\u2019s office to accuse her brother of buying a sex tape of her and Robby, which was a complete lie, and now she\u2019s telling more lies about me. Although our hearts are broken, Lindsie is our daughter and we will always love her.\u201d\n\nTODD CHRISLEY: GOD IS GIVING ME A VOICE\n\nJosh Murray denied he had an affair with Lindsie. He insisted they've only \"been friends for years.\" In a statement to Entertainment Tonight, Murray said: \"I know Todd and his family are going through some tough times right now and I pray everything works out in their favor.\n\nLINDSIE CHRISLEY SAYS DAD TODD 'WRECKED HER LIFE'\n\n\"They should probably focus on how not to be imprisoned for 30 years rather than spreading gossip to try and hurt their daughter. I truly believe they are good people and I wish them the best in however they choose to go about their actions.\"\n\nLINDSIE CHRISLEY REPORTEDLY CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY AMID EXTORTION ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FATHER\n\nIn any case, Hayes, 30, told E! News that the scandal brought him and Lindsie closer \u2014 and claimed that there were previous attempts to extort him over the intimate footage.\"It bums me out, but at the same time I've known about this. This isn't the first time the sex tape has been held over my head. We were blackmailed with it two years ago,\" he said. \"I knew it existed.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's an unfortunate situation. I hope Lindsie is able to push this aside because she's always had such a great reputation. She's a sweetheart. She's a great mom. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA rep for Todd Chrisley did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "\"The Bachelorette\" star Robby Hayes revealed more details about his relationship with Todd Chrisley's estranged daughter, Lindsie \u2014 and the sex video that she claims her father is using to extort her.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/lindsie-chrisley-todd-chrisley-getty.jpg"}
