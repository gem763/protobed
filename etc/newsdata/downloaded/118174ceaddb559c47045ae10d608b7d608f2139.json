Maybe that should be acknowledged as well.\"\n\nMs Ashford said the judging criteria focussed on innovation, sustainability and leadership, with economic performance being one aspect of sustainability.\n\nBut while Yagan Square, built inside the \"Horseshoe Bridge\" of William Street, would in time become a public destination like Melbourne's Federation Square, Sydney's Darling Harbour and Brisbane's Southbank Parklands, the state government agency that developed it had not given the necessary support, she said.\n\nPerth's Yagan Square opened to much fanfare last year, but two retail tenants have closed and one of those spaces is now being used for pop-up retail.\n\n\"All great squares in the world have activation funding to support local tourism and businesses, driving ongoing community engagement and place activation,\" Ms Ashford said. \"Yagan Square was designed with similar intent, however, this funding has not been fulfilled.\"\n\nDevelopmentWA, the state agency that took over the role of the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority earlier this year, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile businesses on the outside of Yagan Square's Market Hall were doing well, those inside, which did not get enough foot traffic, were finding it harder, commercial real estate agents said.\n\n\"Commercially, some of it works, some of it doesn't,\" said Lease Equity agent Jim Tsagalis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYagan Square's combined role as a cultural destination telling stories of the local Whadjuk Noongar people and as a shopping destination made it more challenging to curate the right mix of retail, Mr Tsagalis said.\n\n\"Its purpose is more than just a retail location,\" he said. \"It's a cultural piece.\"\n\nConsultant and landscape architect Catherin Bull said the success of any project depended on the client, whether public or private sector, being clear about what purpose they wanted a site to achieve.\n\n\"In most vital cites, the authorities will have, if you like a sense of the variety of types of space they need to incorporate,\" said Dr Bull, who holds professorial roles at both the University of Melbourne and Queensland University of Technology.\n\n\"If they\u2019re not clear about that, or they\u2019re mixing up criteria when putting together briefs or making decisions about where they\u2019re going to go, that\u2019s unfortunate and doesn\u2019t help anybody.\"\n\nMr Tsagalis said that without a large resident population in Perth's CBD, such as foreign students, any retailer was dependent on office workers for business. Yagan Square was too far from precincts such as St George's Terrace to draw them, he said.\n\n\"For most office workers, it's a bit too far to walk to,\" Mr Tsagalis said.", "description": "Perth's Yagan Square has successfully attracted tourists, but it's been less of a boon for some retailers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3641%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_427/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/295ae0d88a7fd54556f19a2690b7848a715a1343", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
