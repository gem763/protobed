Like, really seductive. Please allow Claes Bang to sexually challenge you in the first trailer for Dracula, the three-part BBC miniseries helmed by Sherlock alums Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. (Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s coming to Netflix, too.) There\u2019s blood oozing everywhere. A bunch of nuns holding stakes. Throbbing human flesh just waiting to be consumed by the Count himself. And \u2026 castles. Just a lot of sweet, sweet external castle shots. The series will follow our vampire \u201cfrom his origins in Eastern Europe to his battles with Van Helsing\u2019s descendent and beyond,\u201d and, because we know you\u2019re curious, there\u2019s no Mrs. Dracula. It\u2019ll premiere on Christmas in the U.K., but no word yet for us Anglophiles.\n\nRelated", "description": "Claes Bang stars as Dracula in the first trailer for BBC\u2019s Dracula, which is written by Sherlock veterans Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/26/27-dracula.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
