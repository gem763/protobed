A deal that recognises Northern Ireland's unique history and geography.\n\n'A deal that supports our business community and families across this Province.\n\n'But, this party will only support a deal that ensures Northern Ireland leaves the European Union in a way that protects both the economic and constitutional integrity of our United Kingdom.'\n\nMr Dodds said the current deal provided the 'worst of both worlds'.", "description": "DUP leader Arlene Foster has demanded Boris Johnson rethink his Brexit deal because is 'damaging' to Northern Ireland during her party's conference in Belfast today.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/17/20220098-0-image-a-3_1572106415816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
