Those include two additional Patriot missile batteries, made by Raytheon Co and the Lockheed Martin Corp-built, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD.\n\nThe U.S. military deployments appear to close the door to any near-term decision to wage retaliatory strikes against Iran following the attack, which rattled global markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defenses.\n\n\u2018RESTRAINT\u2019\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he believed his military restraint so far showed \u201cstrength,\u201d as he instead imposed another round of economic sanctions on Tehran.\n\nIran denies any involvement and the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nWashington says the trajectory of the incoming missiles and drones eliminate Yemen, however, as the staging ground for the strike.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat, Adel al-Jubeir, said this week the United Nations was helping it identify the launch site, but suggested the investigation could take weeks, not days, to complete.\n\nFrance has also sent a team of military experts to investigate, including specialists in explosives, missile trajectory and ground-to-air defense systems.\n\nThe United States has been trying to rally the international community toward joint action to deter additional attacks by Iran or Iran\u2019s proxies. This week, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement it was clear Iran was responsible for the attack, adding: \u201cThere is no other plausible explanation.\u201d\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, without naming any individual nations, suggested that Washington expected other allies to contribute more militarily.\n\n\u201cOther countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense,\u201d Hoffman said in the statement.", "description": "The Pentagon said on Thursday it plans to send four radar systems, a battery of Patriot missiles and about 200 support personnel to bolster Saudi Arabia's defenses after the largest-ever attack on the kingdom's oil facilities this month.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
