It was rushed to the floor without a single hearing, and \u2014 according to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 would have thrown at least 15 million off the insurance rolls and caused premiums to soar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSen.

This not only would have added to the uninsured rolls, and especially hit poor Medicaid beneficiaries, but also threatened guaranteed coverage protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, which every Republican proposal did.\n\nThe Trump administration, which still is trying to have the courts throw out the entire law, used a scaled-back Graham-Cassidy measure in its budget.\n\nThe result under any Trump or Congressional Republican initiative, says Aviva Aaron-Dine, the top health care analyst at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, \"would be that lower income people, older people and sicker people would all be exposed to higher costs, and overall the individual market would look a lot like it did before the ACA.\"\n\nHowever House Republican claims to go after the deficit following the next election is even funnier.\n\nHouse minority leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyClarence Thomas, Joe Manchin, Rudy Giuliani among guests at second state visit under Trump Hillicon Valley: Lawmakers say Zuckerberg to 'cooperate' on antitrust probes | Dems see victory after McConnell backs election security funds | Twitter takes down fake pro-Saudi accounts Lawmakers say Zuckerberg has agreed to 'cooperate' with antitrust probe MORE (R-Calif.), as shallow on policy as he is steeped in politics, vowed \"the first thing we would do is make sure our debt is taken care of.\u201d\n\nIn the first fiscal year under Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaKrystal Ball tears into 'Never Trump' Republicans Sanders campaign announces it contacted over 1 million Iowa voters Iowa Steak Fry to draw record crowds for Democrats MORE, largely due to the greatest financial crisis since the depression, the deficit soared to more than $1.4 trillion. Congressional Republicans were horrified. When the annual deficit was cut by a third the last several years of the Obama Administration, they remained critical, shocked at the fiscal irresponsibility.\n\nCandidate Trump insisted he not only would eliminate deficits but \u2014 within eight years \u2014 wipe out the entire national debt.\n\nTwo promises he kept were to enact a massive tax cut costing $1.9 trillion over a decade and not touching spending on the big Medicare and Social Security benefits.\n\nNo surprise that the annual deficit has soared to over $1 trillion this year and is projected to remain at that level \u2014 or higher \u2014 throughout the next decade.\n\nThe national debt has increased to more than $22 trillion, and by the end of the next decade will rise to 95 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since right after World War II.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vast majority of House Republicans voted for those huge tax cuts currently propelling the deficit and have remained silent on cutting politically popular entitlements.\n\nIn responding to McCarthy and other born-again-to-be deficit hawks, Maya McGuineas, who runs the bi-partisan committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, notes: \"Having people who voted for the tax cuts and huge spending increases now calling for fiscal responsibility rings a bit hollow, to put it mildly.\"\n\nThese Republicans calculate they might get away with this hypocrisy by focusing on Democrats wanting to kill ObamaCare to replace it with a government-run plan and embracing a wildly expensive domestic agenda.\n\nThat's their only choice under Trump, to whom they have sold their policy, as well as their political souls.", "description": "At their Baltimore retreat last weekend, House Republicans stepped up to provide Borowitz- and Onion-worthy laughs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mccarthykevin_091019gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
