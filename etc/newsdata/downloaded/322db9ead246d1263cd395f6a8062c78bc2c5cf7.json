Tonight, Cain learns the full truth about his son.\n\nAfter becoming suspicious of Moira\u2019s odd behaviour, Faith (Sally Dexter) put two and two together, and believed her daughter-in-law was having an affair with Pete (Anthony Quinlan). She informed Cain of her theory, and Cain proceeded to attack Pete \u2014 an altercation which resulted in Pete finally revealing that it was Nate whom his wife had been sleeping with.\n\nCain orchestrated a revenge scheme and after, getting Moira and Nate out on to a boat, he revealed to the farmhand that he was aware of the affair. A physical altercation ensued \u2014 during which Nate revealed that he is, in fact, Cain\u2019s son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelation left both Cain and Moira speechless, but they had little time to process the news, as Moira ended up in the water, and Cain jumped in to save her. Afterwards, the boat exploded, but Moira convinced her husband to save Nate \u2014 and he reluctantly did so, before leaving them there as he drove off.\n\nTonight, as Cain struggles to process everything that\u2019s happened, he confronts Nate \u2014 and learns the truth about the man claiming to be his son. More specifically, he learns who the young man\u2019s mother is.\n\nThe question is: how will Cain react to learning the truth?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, did he know he had another son out there? Or is this all fresh news to him?\n\nMoreover, will Cain even care anymore?\n\nNate\u2019s affair with Moira certainly isn\u2019t the right way to build a father/son relationship, so \u2014 whether or not he knew of Nate\u2019s existence could prove to be irrelevant \u2014 as he\u2019ll likely want nothing to do with him after everything that has transpired.\n\nEmmerdale continues Thursday 24thOctober at 7:30pm and 8:30pm.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Is Faith Dingle Nate Robinson\u2019s mum as fans predict huge Cain twist?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After learning that Nate was sleeping with Moira, Cain discovered that the farmhand is his son.
