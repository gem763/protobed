Our support staff deserves a livable wage, and we only have a nurse one day a week \u2014 are we supposed to stop teaching and become nurses?\u201d she concluded.\n\nDespite the strike, negotiations resumed on Thursday morning, according to ABC 7 Chicago.", "description": "Chicago teachers began a planned strike Thursday morning after many unsuccessful attempts to reach a deal regarding contract negotiations.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181666264-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
