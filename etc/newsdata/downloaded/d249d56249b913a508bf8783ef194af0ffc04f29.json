A person who reaches 70 is considered \u201crare and precious\u201d (guxi \u53e4\u7a00) and the 70th birthday is worth a big celebration. To mark its own 70th anniversary on October 1, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) will hold a mass parade in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\n\nFor the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has ruled such a vast country for 70 years and turned what was once viewed as the \u201csick man of Asia\u201d into a major world power and the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, this is a rare and precious occasion worth celebrating in a grandiose way.\n\nThe history of parades to mark China\u2019s National Day can help to track the changing concerns and priorities of the country\u2019s leadership over the past 70 years. Over time, such mega events have helped to validate the political status and legitimacy of the CCP leadership, and connect the distant, autocratic state with ordinary people through spectacle.\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in 1949, one of the major tasks of the new People\u2019s Government was national, cultural and educational work, which meant raising the cultural level of the masses. It sent delegations to the USSR to learn how to stage \u201csocialist-style\u201d national events. In the early years of the PRC, the state staged two annual mass parades, one on May Day and the other on the national day on October 1, whose design closely resembled Soviet parades. They were displays of the CCP\u2019s military force, core economic goals and achievements as well as occasions for the masses to show devotion to the party and state.\n\nWikimedia Commons More\n\nThe 1959 National Day parade celebrating the tenth anniversary of the PRC\u2019s foundation was the biggest yet. In anticipation for the event, the newly constructed square in front of the Tiananmen, the gate of the former imperial palace of Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, was enlarged. It would surpass the size of the Red Square in Moscow and become the biggest square in the world, with space for a million people. This was viewed as a tangible way to display the CCP\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d to the world.\n\nBut in the aftermath of the 10th anniversary jubilation, China leaped into great chaos. Mao Zedong\u2019s utopian vision to take the country into a communist paradise ended with the worst famine and environmental disaster in history, which claimed tens and millions of lives as well as killing many animals and plants.\n\nFrugality and revolt\n\nIn response to the \u201ccatastrophic natural disasters\u201d \u2013 to use the official euphemistic formulation at the time \u2013 in September 1960, the CCP leadership made a strategic change to the protocols governing National Day celebrations. An official decision declared that from then on:\n\nNational Day will be celebrated with frugality: there will be small-scale festivities every five years (xiaoqing \u5c0f\u5e86) and major celebrations (daqing \u5927\u5e86), including a military parade, only every ten years.\n\nA march past would continue to feature every year on October 1, but between 1960 and 1984, no military review was held. This was partly due to the disruption of the Great Proletarian, or Cultural Revolution.\n\nRead more: Why China still can't make sense of the Cultural Revolution\n\nAfter Mao\u2019s death in 1976, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the CCP passed a new protocol to resume the military reviews on October 1. The next parade was held in 1984 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the PRC, alongside China\u2019s achievements brought about by the post-Mao economic reform under Deng\u2019s leadership. But the memory of this celebration was short-lived.", "description": "What 70 years of mass military parades reveal about the Chinese Communist Party's rule.", "authors": ["Xun Zhou", "Reader", "Department Of History", "University Of Essex"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wqf4RR0NrZydCSdz2LHPaQ--~B/aD01MjY7dz03NTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_464/e51913c1d8107cc67f71e8c4998315c6", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
