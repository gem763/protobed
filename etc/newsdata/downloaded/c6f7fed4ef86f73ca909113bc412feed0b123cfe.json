MORE\u2019s latest ethanol proposal, announced earlier this month, was designed to boost the product, promising a mechanism for ensuring large refineries add the gallons of the biofuel that smaller refineries were excused from adding to their fuel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut farm and ethanol groups say the\n\nadditional details released Tuesday\n\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were never part of the package they discussed with the White House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being told that we\u2019ll trust that the EPA will treat you better in the future when they\u2019re the very agency that has caused the crisis and the economic hardships we see today. I\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t need to,\u201d said Monte Shaw of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.\n\n\u201cWe had a deal with the president. We stand by that deal with the president. And today we\u2019re calling on the president to step in and get the EPA back online. Don\u2019t let the EPA undermine your policy once again, Mr. President,\u201d he added.\n\nThe formula proposed by the agency for determining how many gallons other refineries would have to blend into their fuels would be based on an average of government projections rather than the actual number of gallons for which small refineries previously received waivers.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be good at math. You don\u2019t have to be a [renewable fuel standard] policy expert. ... Doesn\u2019t it just make common sense that if you\u2019re going to try to account for something that you should, I don\u2019t know, base it on the real numbers?\u201d Shaw said.\n\nThe EPA pushed back against the criticism from farmers, saying its announcement did not depart from what was negotiated by the White House.\n\n\u201cThis proposal, which EPA will be taking comment for 30 days following the public hearing slated for October 30, is the text of the agreement negotiated by President Trump, USDA and EPA that was announced on October 4,\u201d EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said to The Hill by email.\n\nBut there are already signs the proposal is losing political support.

But in August, the EPA issued 31 waivers to refineries, angering farmers who said it would reduce demand for their products.\n\nThe following months led to a tug of war as the White House tried to appease both the fossil fuel industry and those with ties to ethanol.\n\nBut the fossil fuel industry was not supportive of Trump\u2019s ethanol plan, even after new details were released Tuesday.\n\nThe American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers association called the proposal \"a painful affront to U.S. refiners and the manufacturing workers the president promised to support\" and said it does \"nothing to address the real source of what currently ails the biofuel and agriculture industries: the trade war with China. These adjustments would be bad for U.S. manufacturing and bad for consumers, and certainly not a 'win-win' solution.\"\n\nFarm groups have made clear they hope to drastically change the plan before it is finalized.\n\n\u201cNo more \u2018Iowa nice.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s \u2018Iowa pissed,\u2019\u201d said Craig Floss, CEO of the Iowa Corn Growers Association.", "description": "Iowa farmers and ethanol producers are livid over the latest iteration of the Trump administration's ethanol proposal, saying the president has reneged on a deal struck just 11 days before.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/farm_iowa_corn_072018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
