Growing Canadian crude oil production, at a time when pipelines are oversubscribed, forced the Alberta government this year to impose production limits to ease a glut and support prices.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), whose members include Suncor Energy Inc and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, said the decision was disappointing. \u201cThe (project) has already undergone a lengthy, thorough and extensive regulatory review process, including extensive consultation with all stakeholders,\u201d CAPP Chief Executive Tim McMillan said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement, Trans Mountain Corp [TMC.UL] said that all aspects of planning and construction would continue, since the court\u2019s decision does not negate pre-existing approvals.\n\nIt announced last month it was restarting construction to nearly triple Trans Mountain\u2019s flow of crude..\n\n\u201cThe decision of the court is disappointing but perhaps not surprising,\u201d said Gary Mar, CEO of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada.\n\n\u201cUntil this project is actually completed only then will I have some confidence for the energy sector in this country.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Federal Court of Appeal on Wednesday agreed to hear challenges by six indigenous groups of the Canadian government's approval for an expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.", "authors": ["Rod Nickel", "Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426263997&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83242-OCATP"}
