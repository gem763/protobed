I like it when you\u2019re angry\u2019\n\nBorn in Mexico, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, 36, was raised in Kenya. In 2013 she made her feature debut in Steve McQueen\u2019s film 12 Years A Slave, a role that won her an Oscar. She starred in Black Panther, plays Maz Kanata in the Star Wars movies, and is in the forthcoming Little Monsters. This month she will publish Sulwe, a children\u2019s book, and present a Channel 4 documentary, Warrior Women.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed high school in Nairobi: it was before everybody had a camera on their phone. I experimented with fashion and hairstyles that I am glad I don\u2019t have any record of.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nHaving no impact on anybody.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nIndecision.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nI hate passive aggression.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nWhen I was working on the horror movie Us, playing Red, a menacing character. On my first day I was in character and everyone was afraid of me. And then I went to use the rest room and someone walked in on me \u2013 that just took away all the menace.\n\nWhat is your wallpaper?\n\nThe landscape of Wakanda.\n\nWhat would your superpower be?\n\nI want to be like the Lying Cat, a character in Brian K Vaughan\u2019s Saga comic book series. This cat can tell when people are lying; whenever they do, he says, \u201cLying\u201d.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA botanist.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone\u2019s ever said to you?\n\nSomeone said to me they like it when I\u2019m angry. I didn\u2019t like that.\n\nWhat is top of your bucket list?\n\nI want to visit Scotland.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nManicures.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nA lot of money and all the love in the world. They tailor-made their parenting to each one of us. I have five siblings, and they were very good at exposing us to things that we were interested in.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nLike the froth on top of a hot chocolate.\n\nOti Mabuse: \u2018When was I happiest? When I realised I was meant to be a dancer\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat is the worst job you\u2019ve done?\n\nI waited tables for one night at the turn of the century. They were being fussy about how I put the food on the plates, and I couldn\u2019t have cared less.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nWhen I have a to-do list and finish it in the time I intended to.\n\nWhat has been your closest brush with the law?\n\nMy friend and I borrowed a car from another friend, who was a heroin addict, and we were driving it cross country. The police were about to stop us, and we realised we hadn\u2019t checked the car to make sure there were no drugs. We didn\u2019t have any, thank God.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nScary movies.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff.", "description": "The actor on wanting to visit Scotland and being kept awake by scary movies", "authors": ["Rosanna Greenstreet"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b818cb19f1b8eefaab97ffdc6096cf1b1f3b102d/145_336_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=990e03b3ad61eac9ba5e15f5179f2022", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
