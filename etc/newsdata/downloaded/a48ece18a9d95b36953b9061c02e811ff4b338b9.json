The EU member states would need to agree an extension.\n\n\"It looks like there won't be a no-deal. It looks like the European leaders look open to an extension, despite what Juncker said,\" said Rabobank fixed income strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.\n\nTen-year benchmark bond yields rose 2 basis points on the day, after falling on Thursday following a two-day sell-off. The German bond's yield was -0.38%, its highest since late July.\n\nAnalysts largely expect parliament to reject the deal, but the market is \"discounting some kind of normal orderly Brexit, maybe at the end of October,\" said DZ Bank strategist Rene Albrecht.\n\nUniCredit analysts said in a client note they expect 10-year yields to fall about 10 bps if parliament rejects the deal, which would boost demand for safe-haven bonds.\n\nBut UniCredit analysts said yields would rise less than 10 bps with a deal, \"given the continued weak outlook for global growth and the accommodative stances of the Fed and particularly the ECB\".\n\nRabobank's Graham-Taylor said his base case was that the deal won't pass in parliament, leading to a bond market rally, which would ease if an extension is agreed.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, to 6.0% year-on-year, the slowest pace in more than 27 years. However, industrial output rose more than expected in September and retail sales rose in line with expectations.\n\n\"The Chinese data was a bit of a mixed bag ... I wouldn't describe it as shocking data,\" Rabobank's Graham-Taylor said.\n\nThe downbeat data raised the prospect that Chinese policymakers could prepare more measures to boost growth. But analysts and market players said Beijing has little room to ease.\n\nThe European Council confirmed Christine Lagarde's appointment as head of the ECB as of Nov. 1.\n\n(Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli, additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; editing by Larry King)", "description": "Euro zone bond yields resumed their rise on Friday as the British parliament prepared to vote on Saturday for or against an agreement on the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.
