This year marks Exit\u2019s 20th anniversary (4-7 July), and this attractive university city on the Danube is also the 2019 European Youth Capital. It\u2019s good practice for when Novi Sad becomes the first non-EU city to take over as European Capital of Culture in 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to spot the Habsburgs\u2019 legacy in this former corner of the Austro-Hungarian empire \u2013 Baroque pastel-coloured townhouses line Novi Sad\u2019s stately streets and squares, particularly in the pedestrianised centre. With so many caf\u00e9 terraces filling the car-free thoroughfares, inviting you to stop for coffee and pala\u010dinke (Serbian pancakes), it\u2019s no surprise that the pace here is alluringly unhurried.\n\nWhat to do\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGo for an amble\n\nStart in the main square, Trg Slobode, topped and tailed with the impressive neo-Renaissance city hall and the graceful neo-Gothic Church of the Name of Mary. Dive into Zmaj Jovina, one of the main caf\u00e9-filled arteries of the old town and an agreeable place to stop and indulge in some people-watching. When you reach the monumental Secessionist-style Bishop\u2019s Palace, veer right into Dunavska street, which \u2013 like Zmaj Jovina \u2013 offers an appealing mix of caf\u00e9s, shops and restaurants. Carry on to Dunavski Park for a stroll through greenery before reaching the Danube and the hulking Petrovaradin Fortress on the opposite hillside.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The stars of its antiquities section are three Roman helmets made of gold, and the rest of the museum offers glimpses into why the region became home to Hungarians, Croats, Slovaks, Romanians and Ruthenians over the centuries.\n\nFor a crash course in Serbian art in the Vojvodina region, explore the extensive collection at the Gallery of Matica Srpska. Artworks from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as 20th-century modernism, are elegantly displayed in this handsome 19th-century building, along with copies of frescoes from monasteries in nearby Fru\u0161ka Gora.\n\nHead to the beach\n\nTake a dip in the Danube in the \u0160trand, a sandy beach just south of the city centre. It\u2019s a lovely 2km walk there along a wide pedestrian riverside path flanked by a cycle lane and a jogging trail. Once you arrive, it\u2019s only a nominal 50 dinar (40p) charge to get into the beach (and free for kids under seven). At this fantastically family-friendly mini resort you can swim, laze on the sands, check out the many restaurants, caf\u00e9s and food stalls and let the kids romp in the various play areas.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel a bit regal at four-star Hotel Leopold I, set in the Baroque former army barracks within Petrovaradin Fortress, overlooking the Danube. It\u2019s all very Habsburg within, with opulent lounges, bars and a restaurant. You might want to upgrade to the traditionally furnished superior rooms with a river view, as the classic ones can be a bit spartan. Doubles from 10,800 dinars (\u00a381), B&B.\n\nIt\u2019s about a 20-minute walk from the old town, but five-star Prezident Hotel offers a smart, contemporary place to chill out, especially when the summer temperatures kick in. Thanks to the hotel\u2019s large wellness area with indoor and outdoor pools, hot tubs and saunas, this is very achievable. Doubles from 7,382 dinars (\u00a356), B&B.\n\nSet in a 19th-century townhouse right in the old town, three-star Hotel Veliki is in an excellent location just minutes from the main sights. Rooms are simple but come with kitchenettes, and it\u2019s worth upgrading to an apartment with a separate living room. The brick-lined restaurant is a popular place to try Vojvodinan cuisine. Doubles from 6,600 dinars (\u00a350), B&B.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nNovi Sad\u2019s plentiful restaurants lean towards typically meat-heavy Serbian cuisine, although fish lovers can try the Mediterranean-influenced menu at Fish & Zeleni\u0161. Within this endearingly cluttered restaurant, you can feast on grilled trout for less than \u00a36, fried calamari or risotto.\n\nIts nearby sister restaurant, Project 72, succeeds brilliantly at putting new twists on classic Serbian dishes, and is one of the few places where the words \u201csmall plates\u201d doesn\u2019t send you running for cover. While their take on sarmice (small cabbage rolls) and \u0107evapi (meat rissoles) is delicious enough, wait till you\u2019ve tried their savoury ice cream made from ajvar, a spicy red pepper relish. Truly divine.\n\nFor an old-fashioned, traditional Serbian meat blowout, head to Soka\u010de, tucked into a little courtyard a few minutes\u2019 walk from Synagogue Novi Sad (now used for cultural events). Its interior is like stepping into the 19th century, as you try to do justice to huge platters of grilled meats \u2013 \u0107evapi, pork neck and kobasice (piquant sausages) among them.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nWhen you\u2019re walking along Zmaj Jovina, look out for little passages that lead to shaded gardens crammed with bars and restaurants. Wedged in among the restaurants in Passage Four is friendly little Bezec, where a glass of Serbian wine or beer costs about \u00a31.20. On the other side of Zmaj Jovina, look out for the Rakija Bar sign over another passage filled with colourful street art and lively bars.\n\nNovi Sad\u2019s buzziest night-time spot is the collection of bars and clubs along Laza Tele\u010dkog, off Zmaj Jovina. Head to PUBeraj, on a little side street called Mite Ru\u017ei\u0107a, where there\u2019s a very inviting garden out back.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nNovi Sad has an impressive number of independent retailers, including the beautifully crafted leather handbags on sale at the Manual Company on Zmaj Jovina.\n\nOutdoor food markets are all over the city, and one of the most central is the Fish Market on Trg Republike just north of Dunavski Park. Once the fish stalls pack up mid morning, the other stalls selling fresh local produce carry on for most of the day.\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting the Petrovaradin Fortress across the Danube, pop into Werkstat Art & Craft Concept Store at \u0160trosmajerova 10. Among quirky souvenirs you\u2019ll find some pretty handmade jewellery.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nLooming over the Danube\u2019s right bank is Petrovaradin Fortress, built by the Austrians from 1692 to 1780 to ward off further attacks by the Turks. At one time the vast network of underground galleries was used as a prison, but you can now tour them with a guide. Above ground is the Novi Sad Museum, chronicling the city\u2019s history, and the fortress\u2019 extensive grounds are the setting for the Exit Festival.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nSerbian dinars.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nSerbian.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to add a 10 per cent tip to restaurant bills.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nAn hour ahead of the UK.\n\nFlight time from the UK?\n\nTwo hours and 40 minutes: Air Serbia flies direct from London Heathrow twice daily while Wizz Air flies once a day direct from London Luton.\n\nPublic transport\n\nNovi Sad\u2019s centre is small enough to get around on foot, although there are buses. The train line between the city and Belgrade, Serbia\u2019s capital, is closed while it\u2019s being upgraded, but buses connect the two cities.\n\nBest view\n\nCross the Danube to the Clock Tower at Petrovaradin Fortress, where the wide terrace offers sweeping views of the city and the river. One look at the clock face will reveal why it\u2019s nicknamed the Drunken Clock \u2013 its hands are the wrong way round and it never quite tells the right time.\n\nInsider tip\n\nIt\u2019s just a 20-minute bus ride to visit Sremski Karlovci, a Danube winemaking town that\u2019s one of the prettiest in Serbia.\n\nnovisad.travel/en", "description": "Serbia\u2019s second city has a pleasingly laid-back air about it, although visitors to Novi Sad\u2019s massive Exit Festival\u00a0might never see this relaxed side.
