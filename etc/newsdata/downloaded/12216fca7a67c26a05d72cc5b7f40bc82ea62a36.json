Its wide, sweeping yellow soft-sand beach is the main draw, and the pier that slices down its centre offers a wonderful combination of classic seaside arcades and a modern adventure complex, complete with a zipline that lands on the sand and an indoor climbing centre.\n\nDirectly behind the seafront is the Lower Gardens, where a bandstand provides a jolly score to a summer\u2019s day and a huge helium balloon takes passengers soaring above the town for glorious views of the Dorset coast. East of the main beach is the town\u2019s top surf spot \u2013 Boscombe. Here you\u2019ll find Bournemouth\u2019s hippy types catching waves, or practising yoga on the beach before sipping flat whites at Urban Reef on the promenade.\n\nThe most sought-after rooms in Bournemouth are on the east and west cliffs that back the main stretch of sand, where sea views will cost you a pretty penny. Cheaper hotels can be found in the Boscombe area, which is also much quieter, while the town centre is the best option if you want after dark entertainment in clubs, bars and restaurants.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.
