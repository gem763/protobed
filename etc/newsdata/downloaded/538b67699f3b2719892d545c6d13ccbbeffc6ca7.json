Josh Matavesi\n\nGatland told how Davies Jnr reacted when he knew he would play.\n\n\u2018I said to James \u2018Well done\u2019 and he replied \u2018You\u2019ve finally seen the light have you!?\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018But then he said \u2018I\u2019m only joking\u2019.\n\n\u2018I loved that. I thought it was brilliant. It\u2019s a great response. I love a bit of banter like that and I have no problem with comments like that.\n\n\u2018It just says to me that players believe in their own ability. They want to be in the squad and they think they\u2019re good enough to be in the starting side.\n\n\u2018I thought that was a really good response.\u2019\n\nDavies is one of two changes to the starting XV between the Australia win and this next Fiji game on Wednesday - with Ross Moriarty rotated in for Aaron Wainwright. Prop Rhys Carre comes onto the bench instead of Nicky Smith too.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been really happy with Justin Tipuric\u2019s form but it\u2019s an opportunity to look at someone else, just in case, for any reason, he (Tipuric) does pick up an injury,\u2019 added Gatland.\n\n\u2018It will show us whether James can fit into that spot or someone like Josh Navidi, we know he can play seven.\n\nVictory against Fiji would send Warren Gatland's side through to the quarter-finals\n\n\u2018They\u2019re two guys that are very hungry for an opportunity.\u2019\n\nDavies is no stranger to the Fijians, having played against Leone Nakarawa, Semi Kunatani, Viliame Mata and Jos Tuisova for the Great Britain Sevens team that were hammered by the Pacific Islanders in the Olympic final of 2016.\n\n\u2018They gave us a tuning in the sevens in that final,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018Just look at the players they\u2019ve got, so talented.\n\n\u2018You give them time and space and everyone from 1-15 is a massive threat. We\u2019ve got thing in place to try and stop that and it\u2019s just about implementing the game plan now.\u2019\n\nCaptain Alun Wyn Jones plays again for Wales - and having lost to Fiji back in 2007, which knocked Wales out of the pool stage before Gatland was in charge, he is wary of the Islanders.\n\n\u2018If you look at the leagues they play in across the world, their players usually focus around the most exciting aspects in those leagues,\u2019 he said \u2018We know their offload ability and how dangerous they can be and you couple that with some interesting set-piece plays. We have to be on our guard.\n\n\u2018With regards to where we are we\u2019re very aware we\u2019ve only done half a job. We\u2019re halfway through the pool stages with two games down and two to go. We\u2019ve had two great starts but potentially taken our foot off the gas in the latter parts of those two games. We want an 80-minute performance in defence.\n\n\u2018Time is increasingly finite at this stage of the campaign, but hopefully we can put the product on the park.\u2019", "description": "Joker in the pack James Davies told Warren Gatland it was high time he was handed a start at seven after he was picked for Wales' World Cup team to face Fiji.
