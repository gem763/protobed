He argued the subpoena put him in a legal bind, saying that if he testified, he could unlawfully reveal confidential information, but if he refused, he would unlawfully defy Congress.\n\nIn light of that request, his lawyers informed lawmakers he would not be appearing before members of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees. Should the judge decide in favor of the House subpoena, Mr. Kupperman will testify, his lawyers vowed.\n\n\u201cIt is President Trump, and every President before him for at least the last half a century, who have asserted testimonial immunity for their closest confidential advisors,\u201d Mr. Kupperman\u2019s lawyers wrote in a letter.\n\nAdam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, brushed off that argument, saying it has \u201cno basis in law.\u201d\n\n\u201cA private citizen cannot sue the Congress to try and avoid coming in when they\u2019re served with a lawful subpoena,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Samuel Dewey, a lawyer at McDermott Will and Emery who used to lead Congressional investigations, told The Washington Times he believes the opposite is true \u2014 that Democrats won\u2019t have a contempt case against Mr. Kupperman because of executive privilege.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an odd notion that seems to be going around that when a witness doesn\u2019t appear on the schedule set by the committee that is automatically contempt,\u201d Mr. Dewey said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely wrong.\u201d\n\nHe argued that rather than jumping to contempt, Democrats need to properly overrule executive privilege by holding a hearing and vote to do so.\n\nThe impeachment investigation is centered on allegations that the president tried to subvert typical channels of foreign policy and pressure Ukrainian leaders into opening investigations for his personal political gain in 2020.\n\nMr. Schiff also slammed Republican leaders for continuing to defend the president.\n\n\u201cWhere is their duty to this institution?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is their duty to the Constitution? Where is their respect for the rule of law? This will not be our last president.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have defended witnesses that have resisted Congressional subpoenas, arguing it\u2019s an unfair process at its foundation.\n\nDespite the hang-up, Mr. Schiff said the investigation will continue as planned and won\u2019t be slowed down by bitter legal battles. He warned that if folks continued to not cooperate, they would only build a \u201cpowerful case\u201d of obstruction against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow the White House to delay our investigation.\u201d\n\nMr. Dewey said Mr. Kupperman\u2019s strategy of going to the courts to decide his fate is \u201cunprecedented\u201d and poses a significant legal question. However, it\u2019s unclear if any more potential witnesses will try to do the same.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry continues at breakneck speed. Democrats have lined up a packed schedule for the next two weeks, including a deposition with Timothy Morrison, who allegedly told William Taylor, a top diplomat to Ukraine, about military aid being contingent on Ukraine opening up investigations for the president.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced a resolution urging the House to take a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry and give more due process to the president and House Republicans.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
