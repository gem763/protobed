The former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and the former business secretary Greg Clark were among them. Along with other Tory MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, they had spent their summer holidays drawing up a bill they believed would force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit if he could not strike a new deal with the EU by mid-October.\n\nJohnson had insisted before and since becoming prime minister that he would never ask the EU for another postponement and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, \u201cdo or die\u201d. To limit the amount of parliamentary time the rebels would have to pass the bill, the prime minister had already announced he would shut parliament down for five weeks from next week ahead of a new Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. But the cross-party alliance opposed to no deal had moved fast in response, and accelerated their plans. As they chatted before the meeting, they were confident they had both the numbers to get the bill on the statute book and the time to do so before parliament was closed.\n\nOutside in Whitehall, and down the road in Parliament Square, a constant din of protest and counter-protest rang out from Remainers and Leavers alike. It was parliament\u2019s first day back after the long July and August recess \u2013 and the controversial prorogation announcement. Police had separated people on different sides of the Brexit divide as best they could but still arguments broke out between them on the pavement. Remainers chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d while Leavers carried banners saying \u201cTraitor Parliament\u201d and \u201cBoris. No Deal is Ideal\u201d. Opposite the entrance to the Commons one of the protesters, Dr John Dinnen, said he had woken up at 2am so worried about what Brexit would mean for peace on the island of Ireland, where he was born, that he had decided to get a train from Hereford to protest about a possible no deal. \u201cI feel very strongly about it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the No 10 meeting got under way, the former Tory ministers \u2013 members of the so-called Gaukeward Squad \u2013 asked Johnson what proposals he had to break the deadlock with Brussels and secure a new agreement to stop the UK crashing out in less than two months\u2019 time. If he really had such a plan, and it proved acceptable to the EU and parliament, they made clear that their efforts to force him to go to Brussels to ask for another delay would be unnecessary and everyone would be happy.\n\n\u201cHe had a folder on the desk with him and pointed at it, suggesting the plans were inside,\u201d said one source at the meeting. The MPs then inquired whether the folder\u2019s contents had been presented to EU leaders. \u201cHis response was that the EU would only really begin negotiating in earnest when it was sure the UK was serious about no deal,\u201d said another source. \u201cAnd the PM was clear the EU was not yet sure that we were serious about no deal so nothing had been sent to them yet.\u201d\n\nThe message Johnson wanted to convey was that the MPs\u2019 attempts to block no deal were taking the heat off Brussels. During an hour of discussions, Clark asked for some specific details on particular issues and Johnson said someone from his office would get back to him. Later that day, Clark received a phone call from Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, which failed to provide answers. Instead Clark found himself on the end of a foul-mouthed tirade.\n\nAccording to sources aware of the exchange, Cummings bawled at him, saying: \u201cWhen are you MPs going to realise that we are leaving on 31 October?\u201d before adding: \u201cWe are going to fucking purge you.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson speaking in the House of Commons for the first time on Tuesday.

Reporting on the G7 summit in Biarritz, he struck a different tone about the Brexit talks. \u201cIt is simply not true to say we are not making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cI returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions.\u201d This ran contrary not only to the impression he had given to rebel MPs earlier, but also to a report that day in the Daily Telegraph which had quoted Cummings as having admitted in a private meeting that negotiations with the EU were \u201ca sham\u201d.\n\nAs Johnson spoke, the Tory MP Phillip Lee, a Remainer, crossed the floor of the house to join the Liberal Democrats on the opposition benches. In an instant Johnson had lost his majority; his ability to govern was draining away. Lee and the rebels could see that the Prime Minister was putting out one set of messages in private and another in public. \u201cThe only conclusion to be drawn was that he was actually planning for No Deal,\u201d said one of the rebels. Lee wrote in his resignation letter that Brexit had transformed the Conservative party into a \u201cnarrow faction\u201d that had \u201cincreasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism\u201d.\n\nLater, during a debate that evening on the rebel plan to take control of parliamentary business, the leader of the Commons, Jacob-Rees Mogg, reclined on the government frontbench. The image went viral within minutes. He was accused of being \u201ccontemptuous of this house\u201d by the Green MP Caroline Lucas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg relaxing on the front benches rapidly went viral. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen the result of the vote on the Tory rebel plan was announced, the opposition benches erupted while Tory Remainers tried to control their glee. The government had lost by 328 to 301 votes. Twenty-one Conservative MPs had defied their party by voting to allow debate on a bill that would force their own prime minister to ask the EU for an extension \u2013 which he had promised over and over again never to do.\n\nAs MPs left the chamber, the purge Cummings had threatened began. All rebel MPs, including the father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, and Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, had the whip withdrawn, and were told they would not be allowed to stand as Conservatives at the next election. The veteran Tory MP Roger Gale said Johnson was \u201cin danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and rumours spread that cabinet ministers, including Amber Rudd, were seething and considering how long they could remain in the government.\n\nIt was clear by the evening that part one of the Johnson/Cummings masterplan - to use prorogation coupled with threats - had not only failed spectacularly but had backfired. One of those who were purged, the former foreign office minister Alistair Burt says: \u201cI have never seen a government strategy so misjudged, nor fail so speedily, as that devised in Downing Street since late July.\u201d\n\nAll trust is gone ... and the PM only has one way out Read more\n\nThe treatment of grandees such as Clarke and Soames had upset Tory MPs of all Brexit persuasions, even some of the most committed Leavers, such as Sir Edward Leigh, who voiced his disquiet at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. The rebels said the behaviour of No 10 was swelling their numbers, not reducing them so had been utterly counter-productive as well as deeply divisive.\n\nOn the Tory benches on Wednesday \u2013 a day No 10 had set aside for Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review, with its many promises to increase funding of public services \u2013 purged MPs rose one after another to decry the gradual disintegration of a once-tolerant and internationalist Conservative party.\n\nThere was defiance and dark humour. Soames was emotional and scathing in turns, saying he was sad his long career as a Conservative MP was ending in this way, before noting that Johnson\u2019s \u201cserial disloyalty\u201d in the past \u201chad been such an inspiration to many of us\u201d. Burt asked \u201cif we are being purged now, who is next?\u201d and vowed that the anti-EU obsessions his party had developed \u201cmay have curtailed my future but it will not rob me of what I believe. I will walk out of here looking up at the sky, not at my shoes.\u201d\n\nThat evening\u2019s first vote on the \u201cBenn bill\u201d passed at 7pm by 327 and 299. Barring problems in the Lords it was heading on to the statute book.\n\nOn only the second day of parliamentary business under Johnson\u2019s premiership he had suffered two defeats and lost his majority. Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, observed that \u201cthis must be the shortest-lived honeymoon in parliamentary history\u201d.\n\nIncredibly, some Conservatives went further, predicting that Johnson was cornered and could be finished as PM. He had promised never to extend the Brexit deadline but had failed to stop a new law being passed that was about to force him to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say this, and I hardly dare, but I think it could be checkmate,\u201d said one of the leading Tory rebels.\n\nHe was right to be cautious. Johnson, Cummings, and No 10\u2019s head of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, might not have succeeded yet, but they had another scheme up their sleeves which they believed would still scupper the rebel plans.\n\nAt 7.51pm on Wednesday, Johnson rose in the Commons to move a motion \u201cthat there shall be an early general election\u201d on 15 October. If parliament were to vote in favour in sufficient numbers, and the Tories were to win the election with a big enough majority, Johnson could then repeal the Benn bill and avoid having to ask for an extension. The pressure, it seemed, was on the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nJohnson told MPs it would be unthinkable for the Labour party leader to refuse a chance to go to the country. \u201cHe has demanded an election for two years while blocking Brexit. He said only two days ago that he would support an election...is he now going to say the public cannot be allowed an election to decide which of us sorts out this mess?\u201d Labour and the other opposition parties, including the SNP, had, however, agreed their lines. They would back a general election \u2013 but not on Johnson\u2019s terms and not on 15 October.\n\nInstead they would vote against the motion and say an election should be called when the Benn bill had received royal assent or, better still, when Johnson had actually asked the EU for an extension. Corbyn responded to the election call with mockery. \u201cThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen, because what the Prime Minister is offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d\n\nTo force an election, Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs to back him. But Labour MPs abstained en masse. The result when it came at 9.21pm was 298 in favour and 56 against. The election ploy had failed, Johnson had lost again, and everyone wondered what on earth he could do next. In the early hours of the next day \u2013 Thursday \u2013 exhausted peers who were opposed to the Benn bill gave up their attempts at filibustering in the House of Lords and the last hurdle in the way of the Benn bill had been cleared. It is expected to gain royal assent early this week.\n\nThe headlines in the Tory-supporting papers tore into Corbyn. The Daily Mail declared: \u201cCorbyn chickens out of an election\u201d. But it was the prime minister who was in far deeper trouble. And things were to get worse. Shortly after 11pm, the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo, a Remainer, resigned from the cabinet, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnson speaking in West Yorkshire on Thursday; he was criticised for using police cadets for political purposes. Photograph: Reuters\n\nOn a visit to Morley, in West Yorkshire, the prime minister was harangued in front of TV cameras by residents, with one accusing him of \u201cplaying games\u201d when he \u201cshould be in Brussels negotiating\u201d, and another telling him: \u201cPlease leave my town\u201d. On the same trip north he gave speech in Wakefield, with rows of police cadets lined up behind, declaring that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. The decision to use police cadets for political purposes was widely criticised as senior Tories, including some in the Cabinet, called for a change of strategy. At a dinner that night, the former Conservative prime minister John Major called on Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of Cummings and reinstate the MPs he had suspended, without whom \u201cwe will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect\u201d.\n\nThis weekend, Johnson and his advisers suffered another blow: Amber Rudd quit as work and pensions secretary and resigned the Tory whip. She cited the same concerns that Gauke\u2019s rebels had raised, that she no longer believed Johnson wanted to get a deal with the EU. His decision to withdraw the whip from the 21 rebels was \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amber Rudd resigned as work and pensions secretary and quit the Tory whip on Saturday. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThey are desperate to find ways to trigger a general election in which they can attack Labour and the other opposition parties for blocking the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Polls this weekend, including the latest Opinium survey for the Observer, showing a 10-point lead for the Conservatives, will encourage them to hang on and fight.\n\nNo 10 insists that the prime minister will neither resign nor ask for an extension to Brexit. But doing neither would mean Johnson being in contempt of court and having to quit, say lawyers.\n\nThere are suggestions that he will try on Monday to call a vote of no confidence in his own government in an attempt to force a general election, and ask Tory MPs to back that motion. But would the speaker, John Bercow, allow such a move that was clearly aimed at achieving a purpose other than that stated in the motion itself? Another idea floated by sources close to Johnson yesterday was that he would try to force the EU to expel the UK by refusing to nominate a commissioner, a ploy Downing Street seems to think would bring the EU to its knees \u2013 but which Brussels insists would not work.\n\nAfter a week of such drama culminating in Rudd\u2019s resignation, MPs have no idea what will unfold next. \u201cWe just have to wait and see what the latest genius plans are from No 10,\u201d said a senior Labour figure. \u201cIf they are as disastrous as those they tried over the last few days, I don\u2019t see how he can survive.\n\n\u201cBut what do I know? What does anyone know?\u201d", "description": "As defeat followed defeat, the Brexit masterplan of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings came undone, torn apart by Tory rebellion and cross-party collaboration", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d70e7635c1a2a453d1503c701f220b5eb57f3e00/0_0_2456_1473/master/2456.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=947542d3db7dfa75366951a4cfadfdd2", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
