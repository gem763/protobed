The lawsuit later added an additional eight plaintiffs, all of whom worked at different divisions within Disney and are seeking lost wages and benefits, among other remedies.\n\nIn their amended lawsuit, lawyers for the 10 women sought class-action status \u201cbecause Disney\u2019s pay practices negatively affect their female co-workers throughout the state.\u201d Attorney for Disney argue that the court should not grant class-action status because the women are not truly representative of a class of company employees, such as \u201ccashiers or store managers,\u201d who were allegedly receiving lower pay than their male counterparts.\n\n\"The Walt Disney Company described in Plaintiffs' Complaint is not The Walt Disney Company that exists in fact and law,\" Disney said in a filing first obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. \"The Disney Companies categorically deny that they pay any female employee less than her similarly situated male coworkers and will vigorously defend themselves against each Plaintiff's individual claims. But that is all this case is \u2014 an assortment of individual claims, based on highly individualized allegations.\"\n\nA court hearing on whether the suit will receive class-action status is scheduled for Dec. 11. The lawsuit accuses Disney of violating the California Equal Pay Act.\n\nStocks in this Article DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY $130.26 -0.63 (-0.48%)\n\nDisney said in statements last April that the lawsuit was \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit\u2019s uninformed generalized allegations about Disney\u2019s policies and practices are baseless. Disney maintains robust pay equity practices and policies. Even before California\u2019s Fair Pay Act, Disney created a specialized team of compensation professionals and lawyers to analyze and address the company\u2019s pay equity practices,\u201d the company said at the time.\n\nAndrus Anderson, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, announced the expanded lawsuit in September. The lawyers alleged that one of the women, Nancy Dolan, earned roughly $30,000 than \u201cthe average senior manager at Disney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe growing number of women employees stepping forward shows that unequal compensation for women seems to be engrained in Disney\u2019s culture,\u201d said pay gap attorney Lori E. Andrus. \u201cDisney needs to take a long hard look at how it\u2019s compensating its women employees. It is only fair that they be given equal pay for equal work.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "In their amended lawsuit, lawyers for the 10 women sought class-action status \u201cbecause Disney\u2019s pay practices negatively affect their female co-workers throughout the state.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP-Disney.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
