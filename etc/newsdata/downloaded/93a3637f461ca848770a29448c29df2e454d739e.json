Show Hide At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment. The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.\n\nWTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.\n\nSome no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.\n\nThe director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has told Prospect magazine that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d. Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy. Martin Belam\n\nIn a bullish performance, Johnson said repeatedly that the public are weary of Brexit and just want to get it done \u2013 the slogan of this year\u2019s autumn conference.\n\nHe said there was still a chance of reaching a deal with the EU but that efforts were not helped by the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for a Brexit extension if he has not struck a deal by 19 October.\n\nHe said: \u201cObviously the chances of a deal or no deal depend very much on the common sense of our friends and partners. It has not been helped by the surrender act.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a good chance [of getting a deal] and we\u2019re working incredibly hard. I\u2019ve been having conversations ... we will continue to work tomorrow and in the course of the next few days \u2026 to see if we can get this thing over the line. And there\u2019s a good chance.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was still possible to leave on 31 October without a deal, he replied: \u201cOf course we can.\u201d\n\nAsked about suggestions that the government could use EU law to supersede the Benn Act or use contingency powers, he said it was a hypothetical scenario that he would not discuss.\n\nAsked directly if he had spoken to any other EU heads of state and requested they veto an extension, including the rightwing Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, he said: \u201cI am certainly not now going into the discussions I\u2019m having with other EU heads of state about the negotiations because they are interesting, but they are also delicate.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said it was clear that \u201cother EU countries do not want this thing to keep dragging on\u201d.\n\nDespite depicting himself as the man who can deliver Brexit, he ruled out quitting should he be forced into a delay. \u201cNo \u2026 I\u2019ve undertaken to lead my party and the country at a difficult time \u2026 and I\u2019m going to continue to do that. I believe it\u2019s my responsibility to do that.\u201d\n\nHe said he could not discuss whether he had apologised to the Queen after the supreme court found the prorogation of parliament had been unlawful.\n\nAfter a week in which he was criticised for his use of language around Brexit and his perceived dismissiveness of MPs\u2019 complaints, Johnson remained unapologetic.\n\nHe said there was a \u201ccloud of indignation\u201d around phrases such as \u201csurrender bill\u201d, which he claimed was masking the legislation\u2019s true aim \u2013 to keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely.\n\n\u201cMilitary metaphors are old, standard, parliamentary terms,\u201d he said, adding that they had been used for centuries and should continue to be used.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot use a metaphor like surrender, to describe the surrender act \u2026 you are diminishing parliamentary debate,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the abuse female had MPs had received was deplorable and that everyone should act more calmly in politics. Asked if that included him, he replied: \u201cI think I\u2019ve been the model of restraint.\u201d\n\nHe was not asked during the interview about a report on Sunday that he inappropriately squeezed the thigh of the Sunday Times journalist Charlotte Edwardes during a private lunch almost 20 years ago when she was a contributor to the Spectator, which he edited.\n\nEdwardes said another woman at the same lunch said he had done the same to her.\n\nHe faced a number of questions about his relationship with Acruri, an entrepreneur he is said to have had a close friendship with and who received public money for her business when Johnson was mayor of London. She also attended official trade trips.\n\nThe prime minister has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigates complaints of misconduct connected to police in England and Wales. As mayor, Johnson was also head of the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime.\n\nHe insisted there was \u201cno interest to declare\u201d amid claims about his association with the former American model turned tech businesswoman.\n\nAsked by Marr if he declared an interest relating to his links with Arcuri when he was mayor, Johnson replied: \u201cEverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety.\u201d", "description": "PM says UK can still leave with no deal and fails to deny asking EU nations to block extension", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Kim Leadbeater", "Catherine Anderson", "Sean Farrell", "Antoinette Sandbach"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4557b1c774d8ad0cd892932bfa1221314916b32c/0_155_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22da60ed8cbe195ba1a568a08c5c9fc4", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
