Three-month bill yields fell on the comments, while U.S. stocks pared losses and the dollar was higher.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year to shelter the U.S. economy from weak global growth and trade-policy uncertainty. Traders in federal funds futures are betting that the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting from the current target range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.\n\nNo Preset Path\n\nPowell was non-committal on what the Fed\u2019s next move would be.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, policy is not on a preset course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next FOMC meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.\u201d\n\nHe said the actions that the Fed has already taken \u201care providing support for the outlook,\u201d which remains favorable but faces risks, principally from global developments such as trade and Brexit.\n\nBut he added, \u201cwe will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 per cent objective.\u201d\n\nThe economy has recently shown signs of slowing as weakness overseas has spread to the U.S. and moved from domestic manufacturing industries to services.\n\nThe job market has also downshifted, even as unemployment has fallen to a half-century low of 3.5 per cent. Nonfarm payrolls grew by an average of 157,000 per month in the third quarter, compared with gains above 200,000 earlier in the expansion.\n\nPowell said that work done by the Fed mining private-sector data suggested the most recent job gains may ultimately be revised lower, but that the pace would still be above the level needed to hold unemployment steady.\n\nMoney markets were roiled last month as a combination of corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury debt purchases temporarily sent short-term interest rates skyrocketing.\n\nThe Fed announced last week that it will extend through October the ad hoc liquidity lifeline that it\u2019s been offering to U.S. funding markets since then.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range,\u201d Powell said.\n\n\u201cAs we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point, we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves,\u201d he added. \u201cThat time is now upon us.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Purchases will made up of Treasury bills, stresses buying should not be seen as return of crisis-era quantitative easing programs", "authors": ["Rich Miller", "Steve Matthews", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/powell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
