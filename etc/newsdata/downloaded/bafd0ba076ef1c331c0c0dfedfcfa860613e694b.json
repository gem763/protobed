That\u2019s why I said our relationship wasn\u2019t stable.\u2019\n\nIn 2009, it emerged that Katie\u2019s then-husband Peter Andre wanted to adopt Harvey but Dwight was furious and wrote in his book that he wanted to \u2018throttle\u2019 the Mysterious Girl singer.\n\nBut he later told Burley in the interview: \u2018I thought he was very disrespectful at the time. I don\u2019t hate the guy because I don\u2019t know him.\u2019\n\nFast forward to 2017 and Katie made her feelings on Dwight clear and claimed he hadn\u2019t seen his on in 10 years, tweeting: \u2018Why don\u2019t you fly to West Sussex Dwight. The door is always open. It\u2019s been ten years Harvey has been waiting #d**k.\u2019\n\nThen in 2018, the My Crazy Life star posted a throwback photo of Dwight happily laying on a bed with baby Harvey sleeping beside him.\n\nIn the caption, Katie said: \u2018Harv as a baby just found these pics. I am so proud of the person he has become. For any of my followers bringing a child up with complex needs I admire you its not easy but it is totally worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To who has never been there for him just remember it\u2019s never too late. The door is always open.\u2019\n\nAnd now, Katie has once again reached out to Dwight to get in touch with his son and threatened to drop the teen off at his doorstep.\n\nIn a video on her YouTube channel, Katie said: \u2018What I would like to do is turn up to his dad\u2019s place \u2013 Dwight Yorke\u2019s \u2013 ring on the doorbell and be there with Harvey, for him to see Harvey.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I would like to do and I will do that. I think Dwight should start entering Harvey\u2019s life, it\u2019s been years. How long has it been? Harvey was four when he last saw him.\n\n\u2018I would love Dwight to come into contact with Harvey, and just stand there, how can you not want to know Harv? He\u2019s so funny.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk have reached out to Dwight Yorke\u2019s rep for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
