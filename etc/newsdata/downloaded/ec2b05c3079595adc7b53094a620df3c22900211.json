And he plans to aim his campaign\u2019s trebuchet at yet another state he lost by only a few votes. In 2016, he lost New Hampshire by a mere 3,000 votes, and there are indications that some if not all of those ballots were cast by ineligible voters. As the Washington Times reports, \u201cMore than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle.\u201d\n\nSince then, Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill into law meant to make voter fraud more difficult. Trump could well win the Granite State this time, and that will knock another hole in the increasingly unstable ediface. Another state the Trump campaign plans to target is Nevada, which he lost by only two points in 2016. By winning all the states he won in 2016 plus Minnesota, Nevada, and New Hampshire, Trump will win re-election and reduce the fabled blue wall to rubble. Can you see any of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic opponents stopping the wall\u2019s demolition with pie-in the-sky promises while the economy continues to grow and create jobs?", "description": "", "authors": ["David Catron", "Spectator.Org"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
