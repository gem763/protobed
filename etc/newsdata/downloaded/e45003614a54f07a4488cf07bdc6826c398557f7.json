The data says \u2018no\u2019 In more than 40 episodes spanning 75 years, equity and bond fund investors have defied predictions that they would panic and spark crises. Yet banking regulators won\u2019t let go of their \u201crun\u201d scenario. Why?\n\nWhen central bankers and other regulators concerned with financial stability warn of potential risks from regulated open-end funds, they invoke the same scenario: a \u201crun.\u201d\n\nDrawing from their banking experience, they envision fund investors queuing up en masse to redeem and escape the market turmoil. In their scenario, the redemptions in turn set off a cascade of securities sales by funds, driving markets down further and potentially triggering a crisis.\n\nIn late August, for example, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the US Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium that funds offering daily redemption are \u201cparticularly flighty,\u201d and that \u201cunder stress, investment funds may need to fire-sell assets, magnifying market adjustments and triggering further redemptions \u2014 a vicious feedback loop.\u201d\n\nThere are at least two problems with this scenario.\n\nFirst, equity and bond fund investors have not run in the past. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) has examined more than 40 episodes of market stress in Europe, Canada, and in the United States, in equity and fixed-income markets, dating back to 1944. In none of these instances did equity or bond fund investors redeem en masse and trigger \u201cfire sales\u201d of funds\u2019 portfolio securities. In fact, in many episodes, fund investors bought more shares than they sold.\n\nSecond, equity and bond fund investors aren\u2019t likely to run in the future, either. The demographics of fund investors and the structure of fund investing \u2014 regulations, taxes and fund management \u2014 both explain and reinforce the proven behavior of fund investors. Those factors also suggest there\u2019s little reason to think that behavior will change, absent radical government action.\n\nIn the face of this considerable and consistent historical data, claims that investors are \u201cflighty\u201d ought to be backed by evidence, not conjecture or speculation.\n\nYes, next time might be different. We can never say never. But in the face of this considerable and consistent historical data, claims that investors are \u201cflighty\u201d ought to be backed by evidence, not conjecture or speculation. These assertions \u2014 contradicted by historical data \u2014 certainly can\u2019t be used to justify imposing various schemes of bank-oriented prudential regulation on funds and their investors, as some central bankers propose.\n\nClaims that fund investors panic and flee in bad markets \u2014 and in turn make those markets worse \u2014 date back to the 1930s. Yet time and again, investors have defied those predictions and reacted calmly, as Figure 1 below details.\n\nTake the global financial crisis, for example. Markets tumbled around the world: stocks in both Europe and the US lost more than half of their value. Yet investors in equity UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) redeemed only 2.5 percent of their assets; US equity mutual funds had estimated outflows of 4.1 percent; and Canadian equity funds had outflows of 2.4 percent. The largest outflow \u2014 12.9 percent from bond UCITS \u2014 occurred after some governments extended guarantees on bank deposits and other instruments, which drew money out of bond UCITS. What\u2019s more, despite this turbulence, these modest withdrawals weren\u2019t accompanied by funds\u2019 \u201cfire sales.\u201d\n\nThis behavior may puzzle some academics and most bank regulators, but it\u2019s consistent with the nature of fund investment.\n\nEuropean and American fund investors represent patient capital. In the US, 95 percent of fund assets are held by individuals, most of whom are saving for retirement. For UCITS, institutional holdings are higher, but they\u2019re dominated by insurers and pension funds, which share a long-term perspective. On both sides of the Atlantic, tax laws, fund regulations, and other factors reinforce the idea that funds are for patient investors \u2014 and discourage \u201cflighty\u201d redemptions.\n\nThe \u201drun\u201d scenario also suggests that funds will be massive sellers of portfolio securities, adding more downward pressure on troubled markets. But that argument, too, fails in the face of historical data.\n\nEuropean and American fund investors represent patient capital \u2026 On both sides of the Atlantic, tax laws, fund regulations, and other factors reinforce the idea that funds are for patient investors.\n\nFigure 2 looks at the market activity of US mutual funds focused on high-yield bonds \u2014 one portion of the bond market thought to face liquidity challenges \u2014 during five market episodes. These funds operated on both sides of the market, as buyers of bonds as well as sellers, even when they had net redemptions. If sales by some funds exerted downward pressure on prices, that was offset at least in part by buying by other funds that saw opportunities. The mistaken view of one-way markets simply doesn\u2019t hold.\n\nICI has provided this evidence to regulators repeatedly in the past decade. Unfortunately, bank-oriented policymakers don\u2019t seem to heed it. One rare acknowledgement came in the US Federal Reserve Board Financial Stability Report last May, which noted that \u201cwidespread redemptions on mutual funds other than money market funds have not materialized during past episodes of stress.\u201d Yet the Fed quickly backtracked, claiming that \u201ca sizable wave of such redemptions during a stress event could depress bond and loan prices.\u201d\n\nYes, it could \u2014 except that those events \u201chave not materialized,\u201d and the evidence says they\u2019re not likely to.\n\nIn most intellectual debates, the side that has 40-plus empirical examples spanning 75 years across a range of markets, plus a coherent explanation that fits the data, would not be on the defensive against conjecture and speculation. Or, as former ICI Chief Economist Brian Reid wrote, \u201cIt seems to us \u2026 that the research challenge in economics is to explain what actually happens, as demonstrated by empirical data.\u201d It\u2019s not to chase \u201chypotheses about how investors might react to market conditions.\u201d\n\nThat would be the start of a great discussion.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "In more than 40 episodes spanning 75 years, equity and bond fund investors have defied predictions that they would panic and spark crises.
