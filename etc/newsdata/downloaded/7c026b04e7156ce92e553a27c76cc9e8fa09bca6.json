When a teacher expressed concerns about the way colleagues were treating the male teacher, the then-principal approached the target of the bullying, but dropped the matter after he claimed to be all right.\n\nAnother teacher reported the bullying to Nio in June. She confirmed that the male teacher had been subjected to abusive behaviors such as being hit on the bottom, but did not take the matter to the education board.\n\nThe education board says it became aware of the bullying in September after receiving complaints from family members of the male teacher.\n\nAside from harassing colleagues, the four teachers -- three men and a woman -- are also suspected of having made abusive remarks to children and using physical violence such as yanking a chair out from under a student to cause a fall.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "One of four teachers accused of bullying their colleagues at a western Japan elementary school also encouraged pupils to defy authority and create chaos in class, the principal of the school said Wednesday, citing one of the bullying victims.
