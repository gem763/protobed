However, a number of Twitter users took screenshots of the image before its disappearance.\n\nLedo Pizza did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The chain has also not responded to people on Twitter asking about the original tweet and its deletion.\n\nBrands have struggled to respond appropriately on social media when attempting to commemorate the events of September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2013, AT&T apologized after tweeting an image of a Blackberry Z10 taking a photo of the two columns of light at Ground Zero. A number of other brands have been mocked for tone-deaf 9/11 tweets over the past 18 years, with many accounts now avoiding tweeting in remembrance altogether.", "description": "Ledo Pizza appears to have tweeted and deleted a photo of a pizza decorated with olives and pepperoni to look like the American flag on September 11.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d790ff82e22af00844abb82-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
