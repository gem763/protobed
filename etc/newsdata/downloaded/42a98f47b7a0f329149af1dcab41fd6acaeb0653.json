Fans packed the street outside the car park just to see him, and journalists packed the opposite pavement just to see them. The sense of excitement and expectation was palpable \u2013 and it has been justified. Liverpool have undergone a remarkable transformation since.\n\nLiverpool went into that fixture 10th in the Premier League table; they go into Sunday\u2019s game at Old Trafford as league leaders and European champions. Of Klopp\u2019s 18-man match-day squad four years ago, three \u2013 James Milner, Adam Lallana and Divock Origi \u2013are still at the club. There has been a radical overhaul of personnel and playing style.\n\nManchester United job is not too big for me, says Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r Read more\n\nThe same cannot be said of Manchester United, who won 3-0 away at Everton that day. Seven of Louis van Gaal\u2019s match-day squad remain, plus Chris Smalling on loan at Roma.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about personnel at United. There is still the same disjointedness, the same dysfunction, the same lack of pace and invention in midfield. At least back then, it could be argued they were reaching towards a style, hauling themselves, however sluggishly, through Van Gaal\u2019s process. But other than a focus on youth \u2013 which is less a tactical philosophy than an economic model, and at times, it feels, a means of deferring judgment, a pre-emptive excuse \u2013 it\u2019s far from clear what is Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s preferred playing style.\n\nThere is a reluctance at Old Trafford to impose an approach on a manager, a feeling he should be free to determine his own philosophy, which could explain why the club are still to appoint a sporting director. That becomes problematic, though, when the manager appears to have little plan other than transferring the ball rapidly from back to front. If there is a detailed focus on pressing shape and semi\u2011automated passing sequences \u2013 such as are practised by Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 there is little evidence of it on the pitch.\n\nEven Solskj\u00e6r seems to have lost faith, balefully acknowledging before the dismal defeat at Newcastle: \u201cWe\u2019re not in the 90s any more.\u201d Yet his whole shtick had been based on Fergie nostalgia. It wasn\u2019t fans or pundits who endlessly invoked the spirit of Barcelona or took the players to train at the Cliff. The world has moved on and while it\u2019s probably as well Solskj\u00e6r has belatedly realised that there is little sense that anything lies beneath.\n\nManchester United should have been careful what they wished for | Eni Aluko Read more\n\nAt St James\u2019 Park, he looked ashen, face and hair slowly turning to the same sickly grey. It seems Solskj\u00e6r will endure in the job for a few weeks yet, if only because the dismissal of a fourth manager in five and a half years would be such an obvious indication of failure that it might begin to take the shine off United\u2019s admittedly remarkable commercial growth.\n\nIt is hard, though, to see the end being long-deferred. The performance at Newcastle was historically bad, the sort of game that often marks the point of no return for a manager. Frank O\u2019Farrell was sacked three days after a similarly awful display at Crystal Palace in December 1972 and Alex Ferguson survived the 5-1 defeat at Manchester City in September 1989 only because of his extraordinary resilience and self-belief.\n\nBut to focus on the manager is perhaps to miss the wider point. Doing so has perhaps been United\u2019s problem since Ferguson retired in 2013. The English game in general has always lionised the boss, perhaps because at the time football became a mass-market event with the first broadcast of Match of the Day in 1964, it was blessed by so many forceful leaders, each with their own style and quirks: Matt Busby, Bill Shankly and Don Revie, and soon Brian Clough, Tommy Docherty and Malcolm Allison. Technocratic detail seemed less important than having a messiah in the dugout.\n\nUnited, having had two such figures in Busby and Ferguson (three if you include Docherty, who had just won the 1977 FA Cup with a vibrant young side when he was sacked for a relationship with the physio\u2019s wife), are perhaps more susceptible to that myth than most, constantly looking for the next saviour.\n\nThe temptation must be for United\u2019s board to look at Liverpool and think of what might have been if only they had appointed Klopp.\n\nThe German is, without question, a hugely charismatic figure who inspires players with his personality. He probably would have fitted quite comfortably into the great-man playground of English football in the 60s. He arrived at Liverpool with a clear idea of how he wanted his team to play and while constantly refining the model has shaped his squad in that image. But he has not done it alone. There has also been significant support from the technical staff headed by Michael Edwards. It\u2019s a similar structure United are now scrambling to put in place.\n\nManchester United\u2019s recruitment has been dysfunctional, admits Ed Woodward Read more\n\nUnited, perhaps, were guilty of underestimating the extent to which recruitment had been centred on Ferguson, his network of contacts and his personal touch. Although it is not how Van Gaal would see it, there is a feeling at the club that he was given too much leeway in circumventing the recruitment process that was being put in place, and the effects of that are still being felt. But however sophisticated the new recruitment model is \u2013 and given it has delivered the club Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Fred, while allowing Solskj\u00e6r to begin the season without attacking cover, it is manifestly no panacea \u2013 that cannot disguise the fact that in the six years since Ferguson retired, United have spent nearly \u00a3900m and gone backwards.\n\nThe shift in the balance of the rivalry has been abrupt. United led Liverpool by seven places and six points after those games at White Hart Lane and Goodison four years ago. By Sunday evening, Liverpool could be 16 points and more than 10 places above United. While Liverpool have made rapid progress, United have decayed: that\u2019s the difference having a proper plan can make.", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, having leapt several steps of the managerial ladder, does not have a preferred playing style and it shows", "authors": ["Jonathan Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bcaf406b91ae13fb4f6b19c407e5d1ed9a4977f/0_212_4370_2622/master/4370.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3a476987e1d841f52484c0da3c5c0240", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
