Combined, these lenders own 42% of the $21,516 billion U.S. national debt recorded at the end of September 2018.\n\nThe second largest category is central banks, which for the U.S. means the Federal Reserve, and for the foreign category, refers to \"foreign official\" institutions. Together, the world's central banks account for $6,708 billion of all money owed by the U.S. government to its creditors, or 31% of the total public debt outstanding, with the Federal Reserve accounting for 12.5% of that amount.\n\nThe remaining categories we've broken out are covered by the U.S. government's \"intragovernmental holdings\" of the U.S. national debt, which includes the trust funds for Social Security and for Federal Hospital Insurance, as well as federal government operated pension funds for its civil service and military employees. These make up the \"Big 4\" holders of the U.S. national debt within the U.S. government, and with all other U.S. government holdings as of the end of the 2018 fiscal year, add up to $5,755 billion.\n\nThis latter category has begun to shrink because Social Security is now running an operating deficit, taking in less money than it spends, which means it has to cash in the U.S. debt securities it holds to make up the difference for paying out retirement pension benefits at promised levels to retired Americans.", "description": "Who loans money to the U.S. government?We've developed the following .09/02/2019 3:08:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Political", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/361/197877ea-b718-4881-95e7-ce2c7d779423.png"}
