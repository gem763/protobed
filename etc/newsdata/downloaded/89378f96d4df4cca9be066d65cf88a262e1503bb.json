To take a dream vacation? To grab a quick getaway? Go in the fall.\n\nThere are three big reasons for that:\n\n1. Airfare is cheap \u2014 very cheap\n\nThis year, in some cases, it\u2019s even a little cheaper than had been anticipated. For example, back in July, I touted a round-trip fall flight to Rome for $450, a very good bargain. By late last week, the price had dropped to an amazing $301.\n\nDon't miss out: Airfare to Europe is so darn cheap right now, you\u2019ll kick yourself if you don\u2019t go\n\nHere are some more deals, all round-trip prices for travel in October or November. As always, prices can change without notice. They can also vary depending on the days of the week you fly; a search tool focusing on fall months can help you zero in on the best deals.\n\nDomestic fall fares\n\nChicago to New Orleans, $70\n\nLos Angeles to Philadelphia, $178\n\nNew York to Charleston, $117\n\nSan Francisco to Las Vegas, $81\n\nEurope fall fares\n\nBoston to Rome, $260\n\nBoston to Paris, $339\n\nLos Angeles to London, $332\n\nLos Angeles to Prague, $521\n\nNew York to Paris, $296\n\nNew York to Madrid, $317\n\nAll these fares are cheap for a reason: Summer is over. Families aren\u2019t flying, and neither are most of the rest of us, thanks to work obligations or upcoming commitments for holiday travel. But, this just might be the year to skip a Thanksgiving trip to go someplace else you and wallet will really be thankful for.\n\nRemember, the days surrounding Thanksgiving will be expensive to fly domestically so travel before or after this period and always compare fares.\n\nDon't dawdle: It's time to start shopping for Thanksgiving, Christmas flights\n\nSouthwest mega fare sale: Winter flights from $49 one way\n\n2. The weather is great\n\nAutumn brings out the best in many destinations: If you want to go skiing in the Alps or Tahoe in late November or early December, you can often do that, or enjoy fall foliage in New England in elsewhere, or relax on a beach in Florida or Hawaii.\n\nFall is a great time to enjoy lunch in an outdoor caf\u00e9 in Paris or New York, and both cities have plenty of museums and theaters to visit when temperatures drop later in the day.\n\n3. The crowds are smaller\n\nFall's reduced crowd levels don't mean you shouldn\u2019t go online to reserve tickets to iconic attractions, but it does mean you're far more likely to get the time slots you want.

These are the scariest theme park thrills at Disney and Universal\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go online to reserve tickets to iconic attractions, but it does mean you're far more likely to get the time slots you want.\n\nOne last reason to vacation in fall: Unlike summer, you won\u2019t be competing for vacation days with everyone else in the office, meaning you have a much better shot of getting the time off you want.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/02/airfare-3-reasons-why-fall-best-time-fly/3840188002/", "description": "Fall is the best time for a dream vacation, quick getaway or any flight since airfare is cheap, the weather's great and the summer crowds are gone.", "authors": ["Rick Seaney", "Ceo Of Farecompare.Com", "Published A.M.
