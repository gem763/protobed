No quotation of the aforementioned article must therefore be considered as a faithful transcription of the Holy Father\u2019s words,\u201d the Vatican statement read.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican has issued a stronger statement to refute claims that Pope Francis has said that Jesus Christ is not God.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
