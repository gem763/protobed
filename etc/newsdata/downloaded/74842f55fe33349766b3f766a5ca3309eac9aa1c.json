Los Angeles became the first team in MLB history to score that many runs in one postseason inning with two outs and two strikes.\n\nThe Nationals mustered two more runs in the bottom of the sixth but couldn\u2019t generate any more offense late in the game. Martin tacked on a two-run homer in the ninth to seal the victory.\n\nThe Dodgers can advance to the NL Championship Series for the fourth straight year by closing the best-of-five series in Game 4 at Washington on Monday. Los Angeles will send Rich Hill to the mound against Nationals ace Max Scherzer.", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 The Los Angeles Dodgers fell into an early hole but scored eight unanswered runs to defeat the Washington Nationals 10-4 on Sunday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
