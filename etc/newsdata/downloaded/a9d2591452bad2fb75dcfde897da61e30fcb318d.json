Thomas Hargrove, the founder of the Murder Accountability Project, a nonprofit that compiles data on homicide, has examined how many unsolved murders are linked by DNA evidence. He believes that at least 2 percent of murders are committed by serial offenders\u2014translating to about 2,100 unidentified serial killers. Michael Arntfield, a retired police detective and the author of 12 books on serial murder, agrees that the FBI\u2019s projections are off (he blames patchy data, among other things) but thinks the number of active serial killers is more like 3,000 or 4,000.\n\nIf such estimates are right, why aren\u2019t more killers getting caught? Take Samuel Little. He isn\u2019t a household name, yet the California inmate\u2019s confessed death toll, across 14 states and four decades, appears to be triple Bundy\u2019s. Since 2012, police have linked him to at least 60 homicides, and he claims to have committed 33 more. According to Arntfield, killers like Little have benefited from the falling clearance rate, which he in turn attributes to a handful of factors: increased expertise (killers have studied other murderers\u2019 mistakes and know how to fool cops, for example by planting false evidence), constrained resources (thanks to stagnant salaries, detectives in some areas may be less qualified than their predecessors), growing social isolation (which can make potential victims more vulnerable), and greater geographic mobility (which can make dots harder to connect).\n\nOne illustration of the last point can be found in the trucking industry, which has drawn scrutiny from law-enforcement officials. As an FBI press release put it in 2016, \u201cIf there is such a thing as an ideal profession for a serial killer, it may well be as a long-haul truck driver.\u201d Truckers appeared on the bureau\u2019s radar more than a decade ago, when an investigation revealed that women were being murdered along the I-40 corridor. Since then, the FBI\u2019s Highway Serial Killings Initiative has investigated the murders of more than 750 victims found near highways, and identified nearly 450 potential suspects, a disproportionate number of them truck drivers. \u201cThe victims in these cases are primarily women who are living high-risk, transient lifestyles,\u201d the FBI has said. \u201cThey\u2019re frequently picked up at truck stops or service stations.\u201d Mike Aamodt, the founder of Radford University\u2019s Serial Killer Information Center, says truckers are well positioned to evade detection. \u201cThe more locations you\u2019re operating in,\u201d he added, \u201cthe more difficult it is for law enforcement to see a link.\u201d\n\nOf course, would-be homicidal maniacs lurk in all kinds of jobs. Bundy was a law student. Samuel Little was a boxer and an ambulance attendant. In his book Murder in Plain English, Arntfield breaks down the top serial-killer professions, and finds that truckers are joined by police and military personnel, forestry workers, hotel porters, and warehouse managers, among others. In each case, the problem isn\u2019t so much the people who fill the job, but the job itself. The key question, Aamodt told me, is whether a given vocation\u2019s duties hinder or enable killing on the side: \u201cThe gas-station attendant has no opportunity. The long-haul trucker has lots of opportunity.\u201d\n\nThis article appears in the October 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cAre Serial Killers More Common Than We Think?\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
