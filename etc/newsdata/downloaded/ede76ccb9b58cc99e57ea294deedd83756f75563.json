The Government selects the most promising for mental and physical aptitude tests.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cIf someone really doesn\u2019t want to do it \u2013 on grounds of religion and so forth \u2013 they can be exempted.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s just because they don\u2019t want to do it, the Government could theoretically force them to do it anyway.\u201d\n\nHer report adds: \u201cAcceptance to the programme brings with it the prestige of having been selected over the rest of the year group and the armed forces have the complete cohort for selection, which gives them access to a far wider talent pool than an all-\u00advolunteer system.\u201d\n\nThe focus could be on recruiting teens with advanced computer skills to units working on cyber-threats, as well as pushing youngsters into the infantry.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIt is expected 5% to 10% of 18-year-olds would be selected for service.\n\nBut Ms Braw admitted: \u201cGiven the importance of individual rights in society and the fact that two generations have not been asked to contribute to national security, the concept of service would likely encounter a certain degree of bafflement and opposition.\u201d\n\nNATO Parliamentary Assembly President Madeleine Moon, a Labour MP who is on the Commons Defence Committee, welcomed the study.\n\nShe said: \u201cThis paper represents a solution to the disconnected relationship between defence and our general public.\n\n\"It would install within future generations an understanding of the threats but also deepen the understanding that the defence of our islands is now the responsibility of all of us.\u201d", "description": "The focus could be on recruiting teens with advanced computer skills to tackle cyber threats", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707502.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Female-working-on-a-laptop-and-holding-a-wireless-mouse-on-a-wooden-desk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
