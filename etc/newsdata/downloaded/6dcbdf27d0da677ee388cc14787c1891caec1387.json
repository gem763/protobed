She was suspended for bullying.", "language": "en", "text": "Aela Mansmann was careful not to name any names. \u201cThere\u2019s a rapist in our school and you know who it is,\u201d she wrote on yellow sticky notes, leaving them on bathroom walls at her coastal Maine high school. The 15-year-old felt that administrators hadn\u2019t been doing enough to respond to allegations of sexual assault, and she hoped her small act of protest would start a conversation.\n\nInstead, her school suspended her, saying that the anonymous notes amounted to bullying.\n\n\u201cI definitely am ashamed to say I go to Cape Elizabeth High School with this being their reaction,\u201d Mansmann told WGME on Monday, as dozens of students walked out of class to protest her punishment.\n\nThough school officials say they are merely abiding by their own anti-bullying policies, Mansmann and her parents have argued that the suspension is a violation of the teenager\u2019s right to free speech. The students who gathered outside the high school on Monday agreed, questioning how a note that didn\u2019t include any names or identifying details could be considered bullying. Holding signs that read \u201cI choose to believe survivors\u201d and \u201cRape culture has got to go,\u201d they said they wanted Mansmann and two other students who were suspended for helping to post the sticky notes to have their records expunged.\n\nThough only a sophomore, Mansmann has already made a name for herself as an activist, winning awards for her advocacy around sexual harassment and assault, and helping to lead a teen summit on combating sexual violence. Recently, the 15-year-old told the Portland Press Herald, she grew frustrated after talking with students at Cape Elizabeth High School who felt they had been ignored by school administrators after coming forward with allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe public high school, which has roughly 600 students and is located just south of Portland, Maine, conducted seven investigations into allegations of sexual harassment or assault during the previous school year, the paper reported. In four of those cases, officials concluded that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that a violation of Title IX occurred, and took action. But in recent months, some students have said that they feel administrators brushed their concerns under the rug.\n\n\u201cOn a day-to-day level we don\u2019t feel believed,\u201d Mansmann told WCSH. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel supported.\u201d\n\nWhile district officials say they are doing everything possible to make the school safe, such as updating their policies on sexual harassment and assault, the sophomore felt they weren\u2019t going far enough. So, she decided to take matters into her own hands.\n\nOn Sept. 16, she and several other students decorated two girls\u2019 bathrooms with handwritten sticky notes, warning of a rapist on campus. Mansmann has said that the intention was to draw attention to several different incidents where students were allegedly sexual assaulted, though it\u2019s not clear if the notes were intended to call out one specific perpetrator. (Officials deny that there is a rapist enrolled at the school.)\n\nFrom the start, Mansmann admitted that she was responsible for the anonymous notes. Her mother, Shael Norris, told the Press Herald that school officials assured her that the teenager wouldn\u2019t be punished. Then, on Friday morning, the paper published an extensive story on students\u2019 concerns about the handling of sexual assault cases, which quoted Mansmann and mentioned the sticky notes.\n\n\u201cCape Elizabeth High School is not special, sexual assault happens everywhere,\u201d the 15-year-old wrote on Facebook, sharing the article to her timeline. \u201cBut just like every other school, we have work to do.\u201d\n\nLater that day, she was yanked out of class and informed that she was being suspended for three days. \u201cI was told someone made a complaint that I was bullying them,\u201d Mansmann told the Press Herald. \u201cSo I thought, why is this person self-identifying as the (alleged) rapist?\u201d\n\nThese are the sticky notes sophomore Aela Mansmann posted. She says she doesn\u2019t understand how it\u2019s bullying if she didn\u2019t write the accusers name. She will be suspended for 3 days next week. She hopes this will start an important conversation @newscentermaine pic.twitter.com/eQExV6uhcL \u2014 Roslyn Flaherty (@roslyn_flaherty) October 4, 2019\n\nCape Elizabeth Schools define bullying broadly, noting that it can include a range of behaviors such as \u201ccreating an intimidating or hostile educational environment\u201d and \u201cinterfering with the student\u2019s academic performance.\u201d A Friday statement from the school district said that officials \u201chave never disciplined a student for advocating for their peers or their views on cultural, social and political matters,\u201d but are legally obligated to take action \u201cwhen a student\u2019s speech bullies another student [ \u2026] even if that same student has also spoken out on a matter of public concern.\u201d\n\nThough barred from commenting on Mansmann\u2019s case due to privacy laws, school officials \u201care confident that the matter was exhaustively investigated and that we took the action that law and policy required,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nStudents who took part in the walkout on Monday said that two other girls were also suspended for hanging the anonymous notes. In an interview with WCSH, Donna Wolfrom, the superintendent for Cape Elizabeth Schools, said that the sticky notes had \u201ccaused a lot of confusion,\u201d and were not the proper way for students to voice their frustrations.\n\n\u201cIt had adverse effects on other students,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there could have been a better way to do it.\u201d\n\nMansmann\u2019s parents have appealed her suspension. Her mother, who co-founded a national sexual assault prevention group named SafeBAE, told the Press Herald that before handing down the punishment, school officials pressured her daughter to name the other students who were involved, and the teenager refused.\n\n\u201cThey wanted her to name everyone who told her about an assault, but she\u2019d didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that,\u201d Norris said.\n\nRoughly 50 students walked out of class on Monday morning to protest the district\u2019s decision, the paper reported. Mansmann, who is allowed to attend school while her suspension is being appealed, joined them.\n\n\u201cIt makes me angry that I\u2019m being punished for bullying and a rapist isn\u2019t being punished for raping people,\u201d she told WCSH.", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a rapist in our school and you know who it is,\u201d Aela Mansmann wrote on a sticky note that she left in the girls' bathroom.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
