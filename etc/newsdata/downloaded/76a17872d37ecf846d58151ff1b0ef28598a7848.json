We don\u2019t look at the bookies, we aren\u2019t concerned. Our expectation is to get better every day,\u201d he told ITV.\n\n\u201cWe have another week in the competition, the prospect to work hard and see where we can take our game and get better.\n\n\u201cWe had great tactical discipline. You try and play at their game, you come off second best. We stuck to our game really well.\n\n\u201cI thought the discipline of our players was outstanding in attack and defence.\u201d\n\nOn his forwards, he added: \u201cThey played really well, Steve Borthwick and Neal Hatley do a fantastic job with them, well drilled, tactically aware.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s hero of their 2003 World Cup success, Jonny Wilkinson, said the modern-day players were \u201csuperheroes\u201d.\n\nEngland\u00b4s Maro Itoje and Tom Curry, right, were called `superheroes\u00b4 (David Davies/PA)\n\n\u201cYou look at the back-row guys, Curry and Underhill, their impact, it\u2019s immense,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at New Zealand and call them superheroes, but you have to do the same thing for our boys and give them credit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a result of immense talent and training, Eddie Jones has created an incredible environment in which these guys can do what they have done. They are on a par with these New Zealand superheroes.\u201d\n\nWinning captain Owen Farrell told ITV: \u201cIt\u2019s a World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, as big as it gets. We feel like we prepared well and we started well.\n\n\u201cIn all these big games, teams get physical and we were ready to go at it from the off.\u201d\n\nOn the final, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant to get there, brilliant to be a part of. We will enjoy this and then make sure we prepare.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup-winning coach from 2005 Sir Clive Woodward said: \u201cThat was totally complete. They strangled the All Blacks to death, not just the first two minutes, but the whole game. The physicality, 1-15, was fantastic. It was huge and totally deserved. They absolutely smashed them.\u201d", "description": "Jones led his side to a impressive 19-7 semi-final win against the reigning champions.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/wire-20213494-1572086351-78_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
