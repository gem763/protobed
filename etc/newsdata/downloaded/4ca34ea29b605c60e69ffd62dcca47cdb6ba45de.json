How grown up in his school uniform.\"\n\nDad Jeremy, meanwhile, has struck out at accusations that he hadn't been on dad duty and was \"neglecting\" his son.\n\nThe former Mr Ireland doesn't see Caben anymore after he was found guilty of assaulting Stephanie in a cocaine-fulled rage when they were together.\n\nHe told the Mail Online that he's had a proper crack at turning his life around, but despite his best efforts the rift with Stephanie cant be healed.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe said: \"Anyone that had half a brain cell needs to understand the reason I am not part of Caben's life is because not every situation can be fixed.\"\n\nJeremy continued: \"I protect my son as much as I can. It's not neglecting, it's protecting. I'm a very loving father. This is better for Caben.\"\n\nHe's now expecting a baby girl with girlfriend Katie McCreath, due in a few months time.\n\nHe added: \"My priority is my baby girl because it's in my control - I have rights over that. My main focus is my girl.\n\n\"I can't speak about it much for legal reasons, but Steph is doing a great job. She's doing really well and I know she's a good mum.\"", "description": "Stephanie shared a heartwearming post about Caben moving up to pre-school after dad Jeremy denied 'neglecting' his boy", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742663.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Stephanie-Davies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
