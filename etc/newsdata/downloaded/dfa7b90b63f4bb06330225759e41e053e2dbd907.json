The system, variously referred to as StabiliTrak (GM), Vehicle Skid Control (Toyota) or similar names, is especially common on sport utility vehicles, which have shown a propensity for rollovers in the past.\n\nThe system works by applying braking pressure to individual wheels of a car as the computer detects that the driver is losing control. Even if the driver is braking to regain control, the ESC system can apply incremental pressure to help the process.\n\nThe new regulation would take effect in the 2009 model year.", "description": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announces a proposal for all passenger cars and light trucks to be fitted with electronic stability control systems.", "authors": ["Kathleen Schalch"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400"}
