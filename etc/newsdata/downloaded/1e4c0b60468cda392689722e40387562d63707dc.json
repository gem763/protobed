The Canadian record is a benchmark that I wanted to beat last year, so I'm excited to have improved my time to get there,\" said Weidemann.\n\n\"Cindy Klassen is someone that I really looked up to as a young skater, so to beat her record is very special and means a lot to me.\"\n\nWeidemann shared the podium with Ottawa's Ivanie Blondin and Valerie Maltais of Saguenay, Que.\n\nIn the men's 10,000-metre event, Calgary's Ted-Jan Bloemen won in 12:54.92. Graeme Fish of Moose Jaw, Sask., and Toronto's Jordan Belchos earned the silver and bronze medals respectively.\n\nBloemen recently became a father.\n\n\"Every day I get home and see my daughter's pretty face and it gives me such a different perspective. It doesn't matter if you're having a good day or a bad day, from that point forward it's a good day,\" said Bloemen.\n\n\"So it was always going to be a good day today, but this win makes it even better.\"\n\nGilmore Junio and Kaylin Irvine, both from Calgary, won their respective 500-metre events.\n\nJunio's time of 34.44 placed him ahead of Laurent Dubreuil of Levis, Que., and Alex Boisvert-Lacroix of Sherbrooke, Que. On the women's side, Irvine won in 37.43 was followed by Marsha Hudey of White City, Sask., and Winnipeg's Heather McLean.", "description": "Ottawa's Isabelle Weidemann made Canadian long-track speed skating history on Friday.
