It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.\n\nThe case stems from the EU court\u2019s 2014 ruling that people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. That decision forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.\n\nOne year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just those appearing on European country sites like google.fr.\n\nNow, the EU court said that such application to territories outside the EU was not legal. It said it was \u201cnot apparent\u201d from the EU legal text \u201cthat it would have intended to impose on an operator, such as Google, a de-referencing obligation which also concerns the national versions of its search engine that do not correspond to the member states.\u201d\n\nThose who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the website to ones outside the EU \u2013 by switching from google.fr to google.com for example \u2013 to find the information that must be removed within the EU.\n\nSince 2014, Google has received more than 845,000 requests to remove more than 3 million web addresses from its results. Around 45 per cent of \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests have been successful.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Google will not have to extend the controversial \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules beyond Europe, following a landmark ruling by the EU\u2019s top court.
