Technology: Passing an 8th-Grade Science Test", "language": "en", "text": "The world\u2019s top research labs are rapidly improving a machine\u2019s ability to understand and respond to natural language. Machines are getting better at analyzing documents, finding information, answering questions and even generating language of their own.\n\nAristo was built solely for multiple-choice tests. It took standard exams written for students in New York, though the Allen Institute removed all questions that included pictures and diagrams. Answering questions like that would have required additional skills that combine language understanding and logic with so-called computer vision.\n\nSome test questions, like this one from the eighth-grade exam, required little more than information retrieval:\n\nA group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function is called: (1) an organ (2) an organism (3) a system (4) a cell\n\nBut others, like this question from the same exam, required logic:\n\nWhich change would most likely cause a decrease in the number of squirrels living in an area? (1) a decrease in the number of predators (2) a decrease in competition between the squirrels (3) an increase in available food (4) an increase in the number of forest fires\n\nResearchers at the Allen Institute started work on Aristo \u2014 they wanted to build a \u201cdigital Aristotle\u201d \u2014 in 2013, just after the lab was founded by the Seattle billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. They saw standardized science tests as a more meaningful alternative to typical A.I. benchmarks, which relied on games like chess and backgammon or tasks created solely for machines.\n\nA science test isn\u2019t something that can be mastered just by learning rules. It requires making connections using logic. An increase in forest fires, for example, could kill squirrels or decrease the food supply needed for them to thrive and reproduce.", "description": "Researchers at the Allen Institute have hit an artificial-intelligence milestone: a machine that is ready for high school science.
