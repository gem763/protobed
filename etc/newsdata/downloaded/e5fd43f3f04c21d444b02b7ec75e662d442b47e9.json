Photo: Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\nNatalie Portman does the crash-and-burn thing yet again in Lucy in the Sky, which was inspired by the astronaut Lisa Nowak\u2019s fabled drive from Houston to Orlando to assault and/or kidnap her astronaut lover and/or her astronaut lover\u2019s astronaut lover. It\u2019s confusing because some of the facts are the same but many of them aren\u2019t, so life and art blur. (Unlike her real-life counterpart, our heroine doesn\u2019t pee into a diaper \u2014 I know you\u2019re disappointed.) The principal innovation by the director, Noah Hawley, and the writers, Brian C. Brown and Elliott DiGuiseppi, is linking much of the protagonist\u2019s madness to the time she spent above the Earth, on a space shuttle. The changes in her brain might be chemical (loss of oxytocin, dopamine), but more likely they\u2019re existential. The first shot is a tight close-up of her face (she\u2019s called Lucy Cola) on a space walk and in a state of rapture, and Hawley flashes back to that moment again and again and again. And again. The movie barely has a present tense for all that flashing back, as Lucy enters a sort of extraterrestrial fugue state. The idea is: How ya gonna keep \u2018em down on the farm once they\u2019ve seen infinity?\n\nDid I mention the flashbacks? Hawley, having begun in TV\u2019s Legion to delineate an arty middle ground between schizophrenia and extrasensory perception, takes his scrambled syntax to the next level. He even plays with the dimensions of the screen, skipping from boxy to visor slit to full frame and back. Jump cuts are the norm, not the exception, and now and then the image blurs into the muzzy-abstract. Countdowns recur on the soundtrack. I\u2019m of two minds about all this capital-A Art. Hawley\u2019s techniques call too much attention to themselves, but I have to tip my cap to such a bold attempt to induce in the audience his heroine\u2019s inner flux and fragmentation. The double-entendre title tells you to expect a trip, and you get one.\n\nPortman, as we\u2019ve seen in Black Swan and Vox Lux and Annihilation, seems to gravitate toward losing her mind onscreen, though she always does so in the context of her characters\u2019 physical discipline. Raised by a perfectionistic mother (Ellen Burstyn) who tells her that women have to be better \u2014 that they\u2019re expected to clean up the men\u2019s messes \u2014 Lucy constantly tests herself, hitting the track every day and pushing herself to beat a record for fixing a panel on the space shuttle, the training done in the deep end of a NASA swimming pool with the astronauts in full space regalia. In the most bizarre and startling sequence, Lucy\u2019s helmet fills with pool water but she won\u2019t return to the surface; she completes the exercise while literally drowning. (Cue more flashbacks, more hallucinations.)\n\nPortman\u2019s determination extends to her accent, which takes getting used to \u2014 though not as much as in Jackie. Her southern drawl falls somewhere between Holly Hunter and Elly May Clampett, and in a peculiar way, its unnaturalness works for the performance. Inquiring after Lucy\u2019s mental health, a psychiatrist cites the astronaut Michael Collins, who flew a space capsule while his two colleagues walked on the moon and wrote, \u201cI am truly alone.\u201d Did Lucy feel that corrosive isolation? \u201cAh\u2019m fahn.\u201d (Okay, you think, but fahn is not fine.) \u201cBest two weeks of mah lahf.\u201d (Okay, but her lahf\u2019s not much of a life.) At home with her husband (Dan Stevens), a NASA PR guy whose mustache removes any possibility he\u2019ll be seen as a romantic figure, Lucy stares at the moon and wonders how people can lose their sense of connection to Earth\u2019s rotation: \u201cWe\u2019re movin\u2019 and we forgit. Ah mean, how is that possible?\u201d I love this performance. Portman is tip-top physically and primed to go astronomically mental.\n\nJon Hamm plays her astronaut seducer as a callow lush, which means we never fully relate to Lucy\u2019s growing obsession. Lucy seems stuck on him not just because he\u2019s handsome but because he, too, has been to space, and their lovemaking is connected to Lucy floating above the Earth. What she\u2019s experiencing is not sexual ecstasy: It\u2019s a heavenly homecoming. That part of Lucy in the Sky is particularly strained, and so is the use of Lucy\u2019s niece (Pearl Amanda Dickson), whom, for some reason, she yanks along for the climactic, diaperless ride. But even when we don\u2019t know what the hell Lucy is doing, Portman makes her certainty a blast. \u201cI\u2019m fahne,\u201d she says again. \u201cAll systems go.\u201d They\u2019re going, going, gone.", "description": "Even when we don\u2019t know what the hell is going on in Noah Hawley\u2019s astronaut epic \u201cLucy in the Sky,\u201d Natalie Portman is a blast.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/03/19/19-natalie-portman-lucy-in-the-sky.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
