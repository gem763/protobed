She Still Isn\u2019t President.", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump has been a financial windfall for a number of political organizations that identify closely with his brand. And few have benefited more in the Trump era than the legal-advocacy group Judicial Watch.\n\nNewly released financial records show contributions to Judicial Watch nearly doubled from 2015 to 2018. Last year, the group took in nearly $72 million. At the end of the year, it reported sitting on net assets of $110 million.\n\nThat\u2019s an incredible war chest for a political nonprofit, a level usually enjoyed only by the most prestigious and established organizations. Contributions to Judicial Watch last year were only about $8 million shy of those to the Heritage Foundation, for decades the conservative movement\u2019s flagship think tank.", "description": "Judicial Watch has raked in record financial support during the Trump era\u2014much of it not from the investigative work the group touts, but direct-mail campaigns pleading for money.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568346938/190912-Markay-Hillary-tease_hgonal", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
