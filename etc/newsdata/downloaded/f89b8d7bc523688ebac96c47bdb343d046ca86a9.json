(NYSE: MRK)'s Keytruda and chemotherapy.\n\nSitravatinib in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY)'s Opdivo is being evaluated in a Phase 3 study for this cancer type.\n\nThe combo is also being evaluated in midstage trials as a neoadjuvant therapy for bladder cancer as well as renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, and head-and-neck cancer.\n\nNeoadjuvant therapies are treatments administered before primary cancer treatment \u2014 such as surgery \u2014 to enhance the outcome of the primary treatment.\n\nMirati is also studying sitravatinib in combination with Beigene Ltd (NASDAQ: BGNE)'s tislelizumab, an investigational humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for solid tumors such as NSCLC; RCC; hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC; gastric; ovarian; and others.\n\nMuch of the recent excitement surrounding Mirati surrounds MRTX849, a KRAS G12C inhibitor being developed for NSCLC, pancreatic and colorectal cancer, or CRC.\n\nThe KRAS gene makes a protein, KRAS, which plays a role in cell signalling that controls growth and proliferation.\n\nThe mutated KRAS gene is found in some forms of cancer such as NSCLC and CRC. The KRAS G12C mutation is present in about 14% of NSCLC patients, 5% of CRC patients and 2% of pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nThe initial data for MRTX849 due in the fourth quarter should come in favorably, Citigtoup's Yigal Nochomovitz said in a note.\n\nmrtx-pipeline.png More\n\nSource: Mirati\n\nMarket Opportunity\n\nWith the sitravatinib-Opdivo combination, Mirati is targeting a lucrative market opportunity pegged at $2.8 billion in 2017. The KRAS G12C+ tumors present a $7-billion market opportunity, according to the company.\n\nThe breakdown is: $4.9 billion in NSCLC, $2.2 billion in CRC and $400 million in pancreatic cancer.\n\nSee also: Nektar Hit With Double Downgrade From Goldman: 'Significant Challenges In Rebuilding Confidence'\n\nThe Financials\n\nGiven its limited revenue from research, collaboration and license agreements, Mirati has been reporting losses since its inception. Its accumulated losses since 1995 total $559 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Mirati Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: MRTX ), a thinly traded, smid-cap oncology biotech, is on investors' radars ahead of upcoming conference presentations and data readouts.
