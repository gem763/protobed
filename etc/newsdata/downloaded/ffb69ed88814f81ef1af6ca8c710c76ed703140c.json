The economy grew 6.6 percent in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe national economy maintained overall stability in the first three quarters,\u201d said NBS spokesman Mao Shengyong.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must be aware that given the complicated and severe economic conditions both at home and abroad, the slowing global economic growth, and increasing external instabilities and uncertainties, the economy is under mounting downward pressure.\u201d\n\nServices and high-tech manufacturing were the key areas of growth, while employment was \u201cgenerally stable\u201d, he added.\n\n\u2013 Propping up economy \u2013\n\nBeijing has stepped up support for the economy with major tax and rate cuts and has scrapped foreign investment restrictions in its stock market.\n\nOn Wednesday the central bank said it was pumping 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) into the financial system through its medium-term lending facility to banks, which is designed to maintain liquidity.\n\nBut the efforts have not been enough to offset the blow from softening demand at home.\n\nThe trade conflict and weak domestic demand prompted the International Monetary Fund to lower its 2019 growth forecast for China to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent on Tuesday.\n\nThe long-running trade war with the US has also chipped away at the Chinese economy.\n\nThis week, Beijing posted weaker-than-expected import and export figures for September after Washington imposed new tariffs that month.\n\nAnd there were mixed signals for the economy in September.\n\nIndustrial output rose 5.8 percent, from 4.4 percent in August, led by a surge in demand for solar panels and electric vehicles, according to the NBS.\n\nBut fixed-asset investment slid to 5.4 percent on-year in January-September, from 5.5 percent in January-August, as the government warned against risky borrowing to build roads and bridges that could artificially pump up GDP in the short run.\n\nChina\u2019s army of consumers were slowly starting to open their wallets again, with retail sales edging up 7.8 percent on-year in September, compared with 7.5 percent in August.\n\n\u201cDespite a stronger September, pressure on economic activity should intensify in the coming months,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a note.\n\nHe said he expects infrastructure spending to decline as China tries to rein in toxic debt and added that the recent boom in property development \u201clooks set to unwind\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe expect monetary policy to be loosened before long in response, but it will take time for this to put a floor beneath economic growth,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 Let\u2019s make a deal \u2013\n\nA \u201cphase one\u201d deal announced by US President Donald Trump last Friday after he met China\u2019s top negotiator Liu He in Washington offered a temporary reprieve from further tariff hikes.\n\nNBS spokesman Mao said the mini-deal was \u201cgood sign\u201d for global markets.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the global economy and global trade are increasingly moving towards reducing protectionism and\u2026 freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal, however, did not roll back any of the stinging tariffs already imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars in trade between the economic powers, nor did it address another round of import taxes planned for December.\n\n\u201cA limited agreement will not resolve the underlying areas of disagreement between the two sides as long-term divergence in US and China national interest remains across trade, technology, investment and geopolitics,\u201d said Michael Taylor, a managing director for Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday that its negotiators have \u201caccelerated efforts\u201d to hammer out the details of this mini-deal, and the two sides were aiming for an \u201cearly agreement\u201d.\n\nTrump had said Wednesday that he hopes to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Chile next month \u2014 but Gao declined to offer details on whether the text would be ready before the mid-November deadline.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 China\u2019s economy expanded at its slowest rate in nearly three decades in the third quarter, hit by cooling domestic demand and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/f9645e_china-economy-has-hit-by-cooling-domestic-demand-long-running-trade-dispute-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
