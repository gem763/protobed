For comparison, the average African buffalo weighs between 500kg and 900kg. At slaughter, some of the pigs can sell for more than 10 000 yuan (R21 000), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi province where Pang Cong, the farm\u2019s owner, lives.\n\nWhile Pang\u2019s pigs may be an extreme example of the lengths farmers are going to fill China\u2019s swelling pork shortage problem, the idea that bigger is better has been spreading across the country, home to the world\u2019s most voracious consumers of the meat.\n\nHigh pork prices in the north-eastern province of Jilin is prompting farmers to raise pigs to reach an average weight of 175 kilograms to 200 kilograms, higher than the normal weight of 125 kilograms. They want to raise them \u201cas big as possible,\u201dsaid Zhao Hailin, a hog farmer in the region.\n\nThe trend isn\u2019t limited to small farms either. Major protein producers in China, including Wens Foodstuffs Group, the country\u2019s top pig breeder, Cofco Meat Holdings and Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group say they are trying to increase the average weight of their pigs. Big farms are focusing on boosting the heft by at least 14%, said Lin Guofa, a senior analyst with consulting firm Bric Agriculture Group.\n\nThe average weight of pigs at slaughter at some large-scale farms has climbed to as much as 140 kilograms, compared with about 110 kilograms normally, Lin said. That could boost profits by more than 30%, he said.\n\nThe large swine are being bred during a desperate time for China. With African swine fever decimating the nation\u2019s hog herd - in half, by some estimates - prices of pork have soared to record levels, leading the government to urge farmers to boost production to temper inflation. Wholesale pork prices in China have surged more than 70% this year.\n\nGo Big\n\nChinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua warned that the supply situation will be \u201cextremely severe\u201d through to the first half of 2020. China will face a pork shortage of 10 million tons this year, more than what\u2019s available in global trade, meaning it needs to increase production domestically, he said.\n\nDuring a recent visit to major livestock provinces of Shandong, Hebei and Henan, Hu urged local governments to resume pig production as soon possible, with a target of returning to normal levels next year.\n\nStill, many farmers are wary about restocking swine after being hurt by an earlier outbreak. Also, piglet and breeding sow prices have surged, making it more expensive for backyard farms to afford rebuilding their herds. Increasing the size of pigs they already own may be the next best step.", "description": "In a farm deep in the southern region of China lives a very big pig that\u2019s as heavy as a African buffalo.", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5033/42521195259841358562e98e9f91a4af.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
