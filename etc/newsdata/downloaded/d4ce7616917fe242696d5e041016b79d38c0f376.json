Well, sometimes good pals have to tell harsh truths. On Thursday night, Horata scored a goal that informed Wolves they cannot get away with sloppy mistakes in the Europa League any more than they can in the Premier League. It was a lesson they did not need and a start to the group campaign that they did not want.\n\nRyan Bennett, in particular, would gladly have been spared the lesson but there is no escaping that he inadvertently set up the decisive goal by giving the ball away to Galeno near halfway. The excellent winger raced forward and crossed for Horata, who finished emphatically from the edge of the area. Braga, nifty technicians, were never likely to pardon basic lapses.\n\nMason Greenwood\u2019s goal gives Manchester United win over Astana Read more\n\nWolves had won all six of their qualifying matches to reach the group stage, their European form offering a pleasing contrast to their struggles in the Premier League, where they are second bottom after five matches. They were seldom flaky last season but are now brittle in all competitions. The worry is the extra workload is taking a toll but Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo rejects that theory. Nor would he point the finger at Bennett, which is fair enough, as the defender is far from the only Wolves player to have blundered this season. What matters is how to regain the solidity of last season.\n\n\u201cWe realise the situation we are in,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cThe reality says we are not performing well so we have to analyse and find solutions. We have to come strong on Sunday [against Crystal Palace], we have to react immediately.\u201d\n\nFor a while here Wolves were solid, justifying the manager\u2019s decision to restore Bennett and Wily Boly to the back three, with the fit-again Matt Doherty starting at right wing-back. They had an early warning they would need to be vigilant against Braga, who were quick to make liars of the league table in Portugal, where they are third from bottom. Conor Coady had to make a good block from a shot by Frans\u00e9rgio in the first minute after a dazzling work down the left by Galeno.\n\nBukayo Saka inspires Arsenal to thrilling win at Eintracht Frankfurt Read more\n\nWolves tightened up and gradually took the upper hand. Neves unloaded their first shot in the 10th minute, a dipping effort from 20 yards that dropped over the bar. Six minutes later he deposited a wonderful pass from deep on to the foot of Patrick Cutrone but the striker\u2019s miscontrol meant a clear chance vanished.\n\nCutrone, endearingly energetic, does not get downhearted quickly and he did much better in the 22nd minute when, after excellent work by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, he used strength and skill to flummox Bruno Viana before blasting just over the bar from eight yards.\n\nGaleno then served a reminder of Braga\u2019s threat by embarking on another sortie down the wing \u2013 the left this time \u2013 before wrong-footing Coady, who put an arm across the attacker\u2019s chest in desperation. Fortunately for Wolves, the referee decided that did not explain Galeno\u2019s subsequent fall.\n\nJust before the break Braga had reason to be thankful when Cutrone failed to find the target from 12 yards after classy service by Doherty.\n\nWolves would have opened the scoring in the 54th minute if not for a brilliant reflex save by Matheus, who stuck out a foot to turn away a low shot by Leander Dendoncker.\n\nIn search of more ingenuity against disciplined opponents, Nuno turned to Jo\u00e3o Moutinho with just over half an hour to go. Braga remained pesky on the counterattack, however, and they scored after, alas, another mistake by a Wolves defender.\n\n\u201cThis is another historic victory for Braga and Portuguese football,\u201d said the Braga manager, Ricardo S\u00e1 Pinto. \u201cIt is not every day you win away to a Premier League team and, in my opinion, Wolves are one of the best teams in the Premier League.\u201d\n\nNuno is looking for a way to prove that is still true.", "description": "Ricardo Horta took advantage of a mistake by Ryan Bennett to score the only goal of the game at Molineux in the Europa League", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a1cb06cbf710c1a139ff89166bae3ca78a68a5/99_95_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c21d836f477538796365109713b94718", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
