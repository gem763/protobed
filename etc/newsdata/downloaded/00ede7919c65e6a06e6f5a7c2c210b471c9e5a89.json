Their loved ones were killed during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises.\n\n\u201cWe want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cBut as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d\n\nThe letter calls for Warners to be part of the \u201cgrowing chorus of corporate leaders\u201d who are taking a stand against gun violence by ending political contributions to candidates who vote against gun reform and take money from the NRA as well as actively lobbying for vital change in congress and helping to fund intervention programs.\n\nIn the new film, from The Hangover director Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix takes on the role of Arthur Fleck, a lonely, abused man with mental health issues living in early 80s Gotham. As society continues to reject him, he adopts a new persona which results in violence.\n\nAfter winning the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival, the highest honor usually reserved for arthouse films not in the English language, Joker has been predicted to make over $80m in its opening weekend, a record for the month of October. While many reviews have been positive, other have been cautious. Vanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson wrote that the film could be seen as \u201cirresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologises\u201d while Time\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek criticised its \u201caggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that one person who may be out there \u2013 and who knows if it is just one \u2013 who is on the edge, who is wanting to be a mass shooter, may be encouraged by this movie. And that terrifies me,\u201d Sandy Phillips said to the Hollywood Reporter. Her daughter Jessica Ghawi, was among the 12 people killed in Aurora.\n\nThe cinema where the shooting took place is reportedly not set to show the film but has yet to make a comment. Last week, star Phoenix, who is predicted to receive an Oscar nomination for his performance, briefly walked out of an interview with the Telegraph after he was asked about the film\u2019s potential real world damage. \u201cWhy? Why would you\u2026? No, no,\u201d he said before leaving to discuss with a Warners publicist. He later returned claiming he had not thought about that before.\n\n\u201cThe movie makes statements about a lack of love, childhood trauma, lack of compassion in the world,\u201d director Phillips said to IGN. \u201cI think people can handle that message.\u201d", "description": "Relatives of those killed at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises have written a letter to Warners to express concerns about the violent origins drama", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc05f6becbd46e0e7d7f2bab13df93af29921f9c/0_83_5850_3510/master/5850.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc99b924b892b63639777972b2590d94", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
