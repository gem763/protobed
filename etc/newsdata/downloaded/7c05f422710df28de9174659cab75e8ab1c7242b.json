He was shocking, abysmal,\u2019 he said on punditry duty for ITV after the game.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019ll be the same in another three or four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Some players don\u2019t learn from their mistakes, that\u2019s a big problem and at the highest level you will suffer for it.\u2019\n\nKeane says England, and Rose especially, could have done better for the Czech Republic\u2019s decisive second goal, while he felt the performance as whole was poor.\n\n\u2018I think there was a lot of frustration,\u2019 the Irishman explained.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think England looked right from the start of the game, and that can happen in football. You go away from home, it\u2019s going to be difficult. But they didn\u2019t look right, they didn\u2019t seem sharp.\n\nKeane felt England could have easily stopped the hosts from scoring their winner (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018There was a lot of bickering going on before the end, which is fine, because players are upset, and they\u2019re pointing the finger at each other.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re five minutes away from getting a draw, which is not the end of the world, and there\u2019s almost a bit of arrogance from England.\n\n\u2018Danny Rose was never going to win a header, there was more chance of me winning a header than him.\n\n\u2018And then [Harry] Maguire, for a guy with his experience, you have to smell and sense danger in a football game, and he strolls out. Get up to people! It just summed up the whole night for England.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has torn into Danny Rose for his performance in England\u2019s shock defeat to Czech Republic on Friday night in Prague.
