This resulted in an immediate decline in pesticide-poisoning suicides and helped reduce overall death rates.\n\nA study covering 2006 to 2013 in China found that as overall suicide rates fell, self-poisoning saw the fastest decline. This was attributed to a range of factors including tougher regulations, fewer people working in agriculture, urbanisation and better health and emergency services.\n\nChina is believed to be responsible for the significant global decline in these pesticide-related deaths.\n\nNepal has banned 21 pesticides since 2001 including five this year.\n\nSome of these were banned for general health and environmental reasons, but a few specifically because of their use in suicides, says Dr Dilli Sharma, head of Nepal's Pesticide Management Centre.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "Pesticide self-poisoning is one of the leading causes of suicide in Asia.", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12CB3/production/_108797967_gettyimages-94143575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
