Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images)\n\nMetaphorical wars, drummed-up crises, and the link between statism and one-nation politics\n\n\u2018So, when we talk about existential threats \u2014 the last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around World War II,\u201d then-candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained at a town-hall meeting last fall, making her case for a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d Referencing the way America mobilized for war against the Nazis, she granted that \u201cnone of these things are new ideas\u201d and that World War II provides a \u201cblueprint of doing this before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting aside the temptation to dwell on the question of what a minor existential threat might look like as opposed to a \u201creally major\u201d one, we should find it a remarkable argument in several ways. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has been lionized and vilified as a socialist radical by the Left and the Right respectively (treatment she brilliantly encourages on social media and elsewhere), and yet by her own admission her ideas are not new. And she is right.\n\nSome might object that the U.S. effort to rev up domestic industrial capacity to produce more guns, tanks, and ships in the late 1930s and early 1940s, as impressive as it was, didn\u2019t leave behind a lot of off-the-shelf blueprints for how we might eradicate the fossil-fuel industry in just over a decade. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day. The true significance of her argument is how perfectly it conforms to the central organizing principle of American liberalism, going back a century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I have argued at length elsewhere, such as in my book Liberal Fascism, ever since the philosopher William James gave his lecture \u201cThe Moral Equivalent of War\u201d in 1906, the agenda of 20th-century liberalism has been an exercise in trying to decouple the benefits of war from the bloody bits.\n\nJames, the philosophical godfather of progressivism (along with his disciple John Dewey), gave the lecture at Stanford in 1906. He proposed that war is \u201cthe only force that can discipline a whole community.\u201d As a pacifist, James wanted to find some new way to inculcate toward productive ends the social solidarity and unity of purpose that war provides. \u201cMartial virtues,\u201d James ventured to say, \u201cmust be the enduring cement; intrepidity, contempt of softness, surrender of private interest, obedience to command, must still remain the rock upon which states are built.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis preferred substitute for bloody battle was a war to conquer nature. He suggested the \u201cconscription of the whole youthful population\u201d as part of an \u201carmy enlisted against Nature.\u201d This idea became the intellectual basis for many New Deal endeavors, from the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to the Hoover Dam and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The CCC was run as a literal \u201cforestry army\u201d in which enlistees wore World War I uniforms, woke in barracks to bugle reveille, mustered in formation, marched off to battle the trees, and returned to bed at the call of \u201cTaps.\u201d There\u2019s a certain irony here. The first New Deal was partly understood as a war against nature and the Green New Deal is proposed as a war to restore nature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the more important point is that the New Deal, that great lodestar of the liberal imagination, was itself pitched as \u201cthe moral analogue of war,\u201d in the words of the dean of New Deal historians, William Leuchtenburg. And while James\u2019s ideas helped build the intellectual framework for an entire generation of progressive policymakers, there was a more immediate blueprint available: the First World War. Throughout the 1920s, progressive intellectuals pined for the days of \u201cwar socialism\u201d under Wilson, repeating the mantra \u201cWe planned in war.\u201d But the booming economy of the 1920s and the live memory of wartime rationing didn\u2019t make for a climate conducive to the militarization of society.\n\nThe crash of 1929 improved conditions markedly. Roosevelt served in the Wilson administration and campaigned on a promise to bring the same methods to bear in the war on the Great Depression. When he signed the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933, he said, \u201cThe challenge of this law is whether we can sink selfish interest and present a solid front against a common peril.\u201d Roosevelt specifically invoked the memory of the First World War: \u201cI had part in the great cooperation of 1917 and 1918, and it is my faith that we can count on our industry once more to join in our general purpose to lift this new threat and to do it without taking any advantage of the public trust which has this day been reposed without stint in the good faith and high purpose of American business.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIt is the most important attempt of this kind in history. As in the great crisis of the World War, it puts a whole people to the simple but vital test: \u2018Must we go on in many groping, disorganized, separate units to defeat or shall we move as one great team to victory?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have also chronicled elsewhere how \u2014 under the National Recovery Administration (NRA), run by General Hugh Johnson, the director of the draft in World War I \u2014 the New Deal militarized vast swathes of American society. The Blue Eagle was the insignia of service for businesses in this new moral equivalent of war. \u201cIn war, in the gloom of night attack, soldiers wear a bright badge on their shoulders to be sure their comrades do not fire on comrades,\u201d FDR explained. \u201cOn that principle those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance.\u201d Johnson sought to reorganize the American labor force as vast industrial armies of the kind that intellectuals had imagined since Edward Bellamy\u2019s utopian novel Looking Backward. But he also be\u00adlieved mobilization begins at home: \u201cWhen every American housewife understands that the Blue Eagle on everything that she permits to come into her home is a symbol of its restoration to security, may God have mercy on the man or group of men who attempt to trifle with this bird.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Deal took other World War I blueprints off the shelf. The NRA was modeled on Wilson\u2019s War Industries Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission modified the wartime Capital Issues Committee of the Federal Reserve, the Re\u00adconstruction Finance Corporation was a rehash of the War Finance Corporation. And so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should go without saying that the New Deal has remained the ideological id\u00e9e fixe of American liberalism, and from Truman\u2019s Fair Deal to Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier to Johnson\u2019s Great Society and War on Poverty to Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cNew Foundation\u201d and Cold War\u2013nostalgic rhetoric about \u201cSputnik moments\u201d and \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, American liberalism has been recycling the same motif over and over again, often without realizing it. Even the mantra of the early Obama administration, \u201cA crisis is a terrible thing to waste,\u201d depends on the logic of the moral equivalent of war.\n\nIn 2001, shortly after the terror attacks, Senator Chuck Schumer wrote in the Washington Post that \u201cthe era of a shrinking federal government has come to a close.\u201d This new challenge proved we needed a \u201cnew New Deal.\u201d Last year, when Schumer and Pelosi unveiled their new agenda for the midterms, they called it the \u201cBetter Deal,\u201d though Pelosi tellingly slipped and called it the \u201cNew Deal.\u201d Schumer explained that the phrase was intended as a double entendre referring \u201cto both the New Deal and a better deal than Trump.\u201d\n\nFrom Woodrow Wilson to JFK, liberalism\u2019s attachment to war was organically bound to nationalism, which is why liberal presidents from Wilson to Kennedy found the politics of actual war so congenial to their agendas. Wilson\u2019s propaganda apparatus fueled the flames of nationalism to the point where vigilante beatings and murders of the less than fully patriotic were horrifically common. The quasi-official American Protective League, a nationalist militia that beat protesters and spied on Americans, had an estimated 250,000 members. Thousands of political prisoners were thrown into jail. The German language was effectively banned. FDR was an avowed nationalist. He sold his economic program as a nationalist endeavor. \u201cWe have united all classes in the Nation in a program for the Nation,\u201d he proclaimed in 1936. The goal was to make the nation a \u201cmore American America.\u201d JFK wore his nationalism on his sleeve, most famously when he instructed Americans: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\u201d\n\nFor the first half of the 20th century, liberals kept their hands on statism and nationalism simultaneously, but starting in the 1960s they loosened their grip on nationalism until it ultimately slipped through their fingers. Some of us can recall the way many liberals agonized over wearing flag pins in the wake of the September 11 attacks. While the rubble still smoked, Katha Pollitt wrote her famous essay \u201cPut Out No Flags,\u201d arguing that the American flag \u201cstands for jingoism and vengeance and war.\u201d She concluded, \u201cThe globe, not the flag, is the symbol that\u2019s wanted now.\u201d\n\nThe progressive historian Michael Kazin showed remarkable restraint when he recently lamented in the pages of Dissent that patriotism \u201cis not a popular sentiment on the contemporary left.\u201d Kazin is part of a long line of leftists in good standing who regret this development in progressive thinking. Richard Rorty in his brilliant book Achieving Our Country lamented how the Left had taken a wrong turn in its infatuation with Marxist theory and the cosmopolitanism that informed it. \u201cNational pride,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to countries what self-respect is to individuals, a necessary condition for self-improvement.\u201d\n\nMarxism wasn\u2019t the only, or even the most important, cause of this evolution. Identity politics and the enthronement of diversity as the highest social value made nationalistic appeals seem ever more sectarian. The more radical phase of the civil-rights movement \u2014 which under Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s leadership had been admirably patriotic \u2014 was one obvious driver of these trends. But the increase in immigration from non-European countries beginning in the 1960s, not to mention feminism and other liberationist movements, made traditional patriotic rhetoric seem exclusionary, at least to some. It\u2019s not surprising that many New Deal and Great Society liberals found what Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called \u201cthe disuniting of America\u201d so dismaying. One can credit the sincerity of their patriotic sentiment while acknowledging that their objection to patriotism\u2019s decline stemmed partly from the way identity politics undermines the statist endeavors they valued so highly.\n\nIn 1979, Samuel Beer, the liberal political scientist and former head of Americans for Democratic Action, chastised Democrats for abandoning nationalism. \u201cFranklin Roosevelt\u2019s nationalism was, first, a doctrine of federal centralization,\u201d he reminded readers of The New Republic. \u201cThe principle of federal activism, which some have seen as the principal dividing line in American politics since the 1930s, was introduced by the New Deal. But Roosevelt called not only for the centralization of government, but also for the nationalization of politics.\u201d Now, however, American politics was being \u201cdistracted by a new and destructive pluralism,\u201d Beer\u2019s term for both identity and interest-group politics. \u201cThis new pluralism disorganizes public policy and sets group against group. Its paralyzing and disorienting effects challenge citizens, leaders and above all the president to elicit and affirm a new nationalism that will again put us in mind of what makes us a people and again give direction to our public affairs.\u201d\n\nWhat is remarkable is that despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 having turned their backs on nationalism, liberals gripped statism ever tighter. Barack Obama, who campaigned \u2014 in Berlin! \u2014 as a \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d and dedicated himself to the tearing down of walls wherever he found them, had no access to the language of nationalism when as president he tried to sell the sort of statist campaign historically peddled by nationalists. Instead he emphasized the more anodyne concept of \u201cunity.\u201d \u201cUnity is how we shall overcome,\u201d Obama proclaimed as a candidate. After the killing of Osama bin Laden, President Obama waxed poetic in his State of the Union address about how wonderful it would be if America could be like the military:\n\nAt a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They\u2019re not consumed with personal ambition. They don\u2019t obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach.\n\nObama was particularly intrigued by the idea of using Seal Team Six\u2019s model for America:\n\nAll that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. . . . The mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other \u2014 because you can\u2019t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there\u2019s somebody behind you, watching your back. So it is with America.\n\nThis spartan construction is the apotheosis of the moral equivalent of war, in which the military is no longer an institution designed to protect our freedoms at home but a model for how we should all fall in line to fulfill the ambitions of the state or whichever faction presently controls it. In his second inaugural address, Obama described his purest political vision. In his telling, America was defined by two entities: the government and the individual, working together to accomplish great things. \u201cGovernment,\u201d after all, is the word for the things we do together.\n\nIn fairness to Obama, there were times when he did draw on traditional themes of American patriotism, but many liberals and conservatives alike discounted those remarks precisely because neither thought he really meant them. Both believed they were boilerplate to sell statism.\n\nNow, under President Trump, liberals tend to find any appeals whatsoever to patriotism (save for those conjoined to denunciations of Trump) to be triggering code words for nativism or bigotry and best avoided. Tellingly, even the very ideas of citizenship \u2014 and the rights and privileges that come with them \u2014 are hotly contested, with many Democrats furiously insisting that denying noncitizens welfare, education in public universities, or even the right to vote is bigoted and un-American. \u201cAssimilation\u201d is increasingly a fighting word. No wonder it has become difficult to appeal to Americans as Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Kamala Harris, an early front-runner for the next Democratic presidential nomination, defines unity in the most clinical terms possible. \u201cThe vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,\u201d Harris says often on her book tour. \u201cWhen people are waking up in the middle of the night with the thing that has been weighing on them, . . . they aren\u2019t waking up thinking that thought through the lens of the party.\u201d No, what unites Americans is that when they wake up in the night \u201cit usually has to do with their personal health, about their children, or their parents.\u201d \u201cCan I get a job? Keep a job? Pay the bills by the end of the month? Retire with dignity?\u201d\n\nNote how there is nothing distinctly American about these unifying concerns. They are common to everybody in the industrialized world and in some cases to human beings everywhere. But there\u2019s another commonality here: The solution to these problems is to be found in the state.\n\n\u2018War is the health of the state,\u201d the Progressive Era writer Randolph Bourne famously observed. This aphorism, which comes from an unfinished draft of an essay found after Bourne died, has become more famous than its author in part because it works on so many levels. It has been a rallying cry for doves, pacifists, and isolationists from the anarchist Left to the anarchist Right. But Bourne\u2019s argument deserves closer scrutiny than the bumper-sticker slogan suggests.\n\nBourne offered both a specific indictment of the nationalist frenzy incited by the Wilson administration and an almost timeless philosophical commentary on the relationship between war and statism. Indeed, it\u2019s worth remembering that the state itself is the offspring of war. As Charles Tilly pithily put it, \u201cwar made the state and the state made war.\u201d States came into existence as a defensive \u2014 or offensive \u2014 response to external threats. \u201cWhile there are many historical examples of competitive state formation, no one has ever observed the pristine version, so political philosophers, anthropologists, and archaeologists can only speculate as to how the first state or states arose,\u201d writes Francis Fukuyama in The Origins of Political Order.\n\nBourne distinguishes between three entities: the state, the government, and the country or nation. The state is different from the government in that the government isn\u2019t representative of all the people, even if the government ostensibly works on everyone\u2019s behalf. By way of illustration: The queen of England is the head of state and the symbol of the whole British nation. The prime minister is the head of government and the leader of a particular party, which makes him or her a legitimate target of partisan criticism.\n\n\u201cIn times of peace,\u201d Bourne writes, \u201cwe usually ignore the State in favour of partisan political controversies, or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit of party policies. It is the Government rather than the State with which the politically minded are concerned. The State is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday.\u201d The government is a gloriously grubby thing, for it \u201cis obviously composed of common and unsanctified men, and is thus a legitimate object of criticism and even contempt.\u201d He adds, \u201cIn a republic the Government is obeyed grumblingly, because it has no bedazzlements or sanctities to gild it. If you are a good old-fashioned democrat, you rejoice at this fact, you glory in the plainness of a system where every citizen has become a king.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the nation or country is something different. \u201cOur idea of Country,\u201d Bourne writes, \u201cconcerns itself with the non-political aspects of a people, its ways of living, its personal traits, its literature and art, its characteristic attitudes toward life.\u201d Further on, he adds, \u201cThe Country, as an inescapable group into which we are born, and which makes us its particular kind of a citizen of the world, seems to be a fundamental fact of our consciousness, an irreducible minimum of social feeling.\u201d During peacetime, we express that sense of social solidarity ceremonially with fireworks and days of remembrance sanctified by the state that pay homage to those few historical accomplishments we all take pride in, and then we go about our business.\n\n\u201cWith the shock of war, however, the State comes into its own again,\u201d Bourne writes. The government, that arena where partisans and statesmen alike disagree with one another about the best course of action, with few questioning their patriotism, recedes into the background. Everyone must rally to the state and its cause. \u201cThe moment war is declared,\u201d Bourne writes, \u201cthe mass of the people, through some spiritual alchemy, become convinced that they have willed and executed the deed themselves. . . . The citizen throws off his contempt and indifference to Government, identifies himself with its purposes, revives all his military memories and symbols, and the State once more walks, an august presence, through the imaginations of men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the very phenomenon that William James wanted to hitch to projects other than battle and conquest. Bourne himself had once been a fellow traveler with the Jamesian pragmatists, who passionately embraced World War I in part because they saw it as the best means to realize at home what John Dewey called \u201cthe social possibilities of war.\u201d Dewey ridiculed those who failed to recognize the \u201cimmense impetus to reorganization afforded by this war.\u201d What Dewey wanted was to loosen America\u2019s cultural attachment to limited government and free enterprise in favor of a more advanced form of \u201cdemocracy\u201d that looked very similar to the sort of socialism \u2014 or \u201csocial democracy\u201d \u2014 that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives champion today.\n\nBut Bourne recognized something that James and his disciples did not. For James, war brought out what was best in nations: the decidedly manly martial virtues. Bourne understood that the state, given free rein, will steadily efface those virtues as it strives to make the people conform to its ends. The government is a means to certain limited ends for the people or nation. The state turns the people into a means for its own ends. And it does this by turning them into its dependents. The goal, from Wilson to Obama \u2014 and nearly all of today\u2019s Democratic presidential aspirants \u2014 has always been to get Americans to define their political identity and meaning not in relation to the nation, never mind the local communities where they actually live, but in relation to the state. What\u2019s different today is that they no longer feel the need to sell their project in the language of the nation.\n\nOne of the reasons some conservatives, me included, have been suspicious of the new embrace of nationalism on the right is precisely that nationalism has always been married to statism and centralization. Trump\u2019s nationalist rhetoric (\u201cthe blood of patriots,\u201d \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d etc.), not to mention his relentless attempts to frame immigration as an \u201cinvasion\u201d requiring a military response, has more in common with the nationalism of statists such as Wilson than many of his defenders are willing to acknowledge.\n\nMoreover, given the realities of polarization and partisanship, there\u2019s reason to worry that a robust nationalist program from just one party will exacerbate the problems it is ostensibly aimed at healing \u2014 by making any talk of patriotism and national pride seem like a partisan cause, or even just another form of identity politics. And there is reason to believe that this is not just a matter of appearances. It\u2019s hard to dispute that much of the Trump agenda is sold with a lot of patriotic bunting and talk of one-nation politics but in reality serves a narrower constituency. Whether a post-Trump nationalism can restore a sense of nationhood beyond the president\u2019s shrinking coalition remains to be seen. But even if it can, there\u2019s little reason to believe that the centralizing statism and entitlement-fueled clientelism implicit in one-nation politics will be reversed.\n\nWhat both Bourne and James did not understand is that war is not necessarily the health of the state. Rather, commitment of the people to the state is the source of its power \u2014 in democracies and dictatorships alike. War is the best means of cultivating that commitment. But metaphorical wars and drummed-up crises will do just fine. And, over time, as the virtues James talked about erode, you won\u2019t even need those to sustain commitment. Dependence on the state will be enough, because once you\u2019re dependent on the state, any attempt to reduce it will bring about exactly the sort of existential crisis the state needs to keep doing what it\u2019s doing.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
