Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey suck,\u201d President Trump tweeted Thursday in response to a Fox News poll that found 51 percent of voters backing his impeachment and removal from office. The low-energy insult was directed at Fox News\u2019 pollster, but there\u2019s little doubt that Trump thinks the network sucks too. In several tweets Thursday, he lashed out at the network for not properly praising him and gave a shout-out to One American News, the obsequious right-wing propaganda network that\u2019s been trying to win Trump\u2019s affection for years.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s anger at Fox News is nothing new. He whined about the network earlier this year for giving Democrats air time and he throws a tantrum anytime it veers away from White House\u2013approved messaging. In those moments, he tries to put the network in its place. \u201cFox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d he tweeted in August. Like his message today, Trump is reminding Fox News that, in his eyes, it exists to serve him.\n\nMany of the people on the network see it the same way. The popular opinion hosts who fill up its nighttime block \u2014 Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham \u2014 are among the most reliable pro-Trump figures in media. They also regularly bring on guests such as Rudy Giuliani and Joe diGenova to lick Trump\u2019s boots. Trump\u2019s problem is that not everyone talks like they do. And as the Washington Post reported this week, that\u2019s causing some problems internally, too. The high stakes of the impeachment inquiry has anyone who fails to see Trump as a king labeled a traitor.\n\nAs much as Trump grumbles though, he\u2019s hardly ready to move on from Fox News. His enduring love affair was made clear Thursday morning by Matthew Gertz, Media Matters\u2019 indefatigable chronicler of Trump\u2019s Fox News obsession. In a long thread, Gertz noted each time Trump has tweeted about the network in the last week. At last count, Gertz had logged 81 tweets.\n\nThere was one relevant tweet that didn\u2019t make Gertz\u2019s list though. Trump sent at 9:34 a.m. on Thursday:\n\n\u201cThank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new, consistent and powerful VOICE! See you tonight at the Big Rally in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nFor months, Trump has flirted with One America News, a down-market Fox that\u2019s unfailing pro-Trump, in an attempt to make Fox News jealous. But his obsession with his favorite network continues.", "description": "Fox News \u201cdoesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore,\u201d Trump tweeted, in his latest attack on his favorite network.", "authors": ["Adam K.
