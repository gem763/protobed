(AP) - The pregnancy of a 26-year-old elephant known as Chendra at the Oregon Zoo has ended in miscarriage.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports veterinarians at the zoo grew concerned earlier this month when they noticed a drop in some of the Asian elephant\u2019s reproductive hormones. Last week, more definitive tests showed that she was no longer pregnant, says Bob Lee, who oversees the elephant program at the zoo.\n\nChendra was around eight months along, which would correspond to the first trimester in humans.\n\nThe gestation period for elephants is around 22 months. Chendra came to Oregon in 1999. She was found as a young calf wandering alone near a palm oil plantation in Borneo.\n\nTwenty-five elephants have been born at the Oregon Zoo since 1962.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The pregnancy of a 26-year-old elephant known as Chendra at the Oregon Zoo has ended in miscarriage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
