The son of the late Kimbo Slice needed just 38 seconds for the finish.\n\nFrom the opening bell, Ferguson (4-2 MMA, 4-2 BMMA) was throwing haymakers. When Campbell (3-4 MMA, 0-1 BMMA) shot for a takedown against the fence, Slice stuffed him. In a manner that would make Travis Browne proud Ferguson hammered the side of the temple of Campbell until he slumped over unconscious.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BABY SLICE BACK \ud83d\udea8@kimboslicejr returns to the cage with the 1st round KO to kick off the #Bellator232 main card. pic.twitter.com/mUl5bwCHE3 \u2014 DAZN USA (@DAZN_USA) October 27, 2019\n\nThe victory was Ferguson\u2019s fourth inside the Bellator cage.

At a pre-fight media day Ferguson told MMA Junkie his knee still hasn\u2019t recovered.\n\nAs for Campbell, the promotional newcomer has lost three out of his last four opponents having competed for LFA/Legacy FC and Summit FC among others.\n\nThe 160-pound bout opened up the Bellator 232 main card at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.
