It started when the unnamed boy complained of a stomachache severe enough to warrant a doctor visit.\n\nDoctors then found over 50 lead pellets trapped inside the boy\u2019s appendix\u2014with no explanation for how the pellets got there from the digestive tract.\n\nWOMAN'S CHEST PAIN DIAGNOSED AS SPIRALING ESOPHAGUS: WHAT'S THAT?\n\nHowever, the physicians didn\u2019t suspect this unusual location right away, according to a LiveScience report.\n\nAfter identifying foreign objects inside what looked like the boy\u2019s stomach, doctors flushed his digestive system out\u2014but the objects remained unchanged.\n\nThe doctors then surgically removed the appendix, finding dozens of lead pellets trapped inside.\n\nTEEN ALIVE AND WELL AFTER CAR LANDED ON TOP OF HIM IN MEDICAL MIRACLE\n\nThe high amounts of lead trapped inside the boy\u2019s body led to symptoms of lead poisoning, including uncharacteristic hyperactivity and lead concentrations of over 5 times more than normal.\n\nThe boy\u2019s family regularly ate geese that they killed with shotguns, which could lead to high lead concentrations in itself. However, the boy had swallowed lead pellets while he and his siblings were playing a game with them.\n\nThis case was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, a more common source of lead poisoning occurs when children swallow chipped paint from old houses. The U.S. banned lead-based paint in 1978, but some old houses still have this type of paint on the walls.\n\nOther sources of exposure include canned goods, toys or candy from other countries. These countries may not regulate chemicals and products for the lead as heavily as in the U/S. Adults can also be exposed if they work in heavy metals, home improvement or car repair industries.", "description": "Dozens of lead pellets were trapped in his appendix, but they couldn't figure out why.", "authors": ["Manny Alvarez", "Dr. Manny Alvarez Serves As Fox News Channel'S Senior Managing Health Editor.
