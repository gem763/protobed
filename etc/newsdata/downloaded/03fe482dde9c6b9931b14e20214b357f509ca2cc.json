You're right.\n\n\"We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints.\n\n\"Like you, and everyone else, we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm.\"\n\nBut they called on the media to focus on the \"more urgent story\" of life on earth dying in a sixth mass extinction.\n\nThey said they cannot ignore the call of young people such as Greta Thunberg to \"fight for their already devastated future\", even if it means putting themselves \"in your firing line\".\n\nProtest ban\n\nMeanwhile, police have begun making arrests after Extinction Rebellion activists defied an order banning them from demonstrating anywhere in London.\n\nAbout 500 protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, some of whom covered their mouths with black tape to symbolise the silencing of their protest.\n\nWithin a couple of hours, the protest broke up and large numbers dispersed. Police arrested a small group who were blocking Whitehall, BBC correspondent Andy Moore said.\n\nAmong those arrested were Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley and George Monbiot, the author and Guardian journalist.\n\nAs he was arrested, Mr Monbiot said: \"We have to make a stand against the destruction of our life support systems.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Author George Monbiot was arrested after refusing to move from the road at Whitehall\n\nAn application for a judicial review of the ban was accepted by the High Court, according to an Extinction Rebellion spokesman.\n\nIt means the case can go ahead, with an initial hearing scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe claimants include the Green Party's Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jenny Jones, Labour MPs Clive Lewis and David Drew, and Mr Monbiot.\n\nExtinction Rebellion argues the ban is disproportionate and an unprecedented curtailment of the right to free speech and free assembly.\n\nThe group hopes the High Court will quash the decision to implement the blanket ban.\n\nIt follows the Metropolitan Police announcing new restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act, which required protesters to disperse by 21:00 BST or risk arrest.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the Extinction Rebellion action is now illegal in London.\n\nThe force said it decided to impose the rules after \"continued breaches\" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been arrested since the protests, dubbed the Autumn Uprising, began on October 7.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he was confident the Met's decision was \"entirely lawful\" and \"entirely proportionate\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Dozens of mothers and babies defied the ban to protest outside Google's London HQ\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The mothers wore sashes saying \"their future\" as they cradled their children\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A large group of protesters gathered outside YouTube's offices in London's King's Cross\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a group of mothers and babies defied the restriction, staging a \"feed-in\" outside Google's offices in London's King's Cross, while other activists targeted the nearby offices of YouTube - a Google subsidiary.\n\nThey said they wanted to highlight the company's political donations to organisations that have campaigned against action on climate change.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said concerns had been raised about the police's decision to ban the protests, adding that shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was discussing it with the police.\n\n\"I think it's important to protect the right of free speech, and the right to demonstrate in our society - obviously in a non-violent way,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan had no involvement in the \"operational decision\" by police to remove the protesters.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Mayor of Woodbridge, Green Party member Eamonn O'Nolan, was part of the protest\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Khan said he was \"seeking further information\" about why the ban was necessary, saying he believed \"the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld\".\n\nA government spokesman said the UK was already taking \"world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050\".\n\n\"While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives,\" he added.\n\nWhat are the rules around protests?\n\nPolice have the powers to ban a protest under the Public Order Act 1986, if a senior officer has reasonable belief that it may cause \"serious disruption to the life of the community\".\n\nPolice are also under a duty to balance the task of keeping the streets open with the right freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and freedom of expression, under Article 10. These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them.\n\nHowever, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: \"The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary.\"\n\nBy law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance.\n\nPolice have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions.\n\nA Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.", "description": "Stars urge the media to focus on \"systemic change\" as hundreds of activists defy a ban on protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13DB7/production/_109253318_trafalgar_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
