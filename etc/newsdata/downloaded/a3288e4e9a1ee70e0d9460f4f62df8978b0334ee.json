As a US-brokered ceasefire in Syria\u2019s north-east expired, they struck a deal to evacuate the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish-led militia, from a buffer zone near Turkey\u2019s border. Russian and Turkish troops will begin patrols of that area, giving them joint control. But while Russian diplomatic skill is to be commended, America\u2019s loss may yet prove Russia\u2019s headache.\n\nFew expected such a turn of events in 2015, when Russia launched a military operation in support of Bashar al-Assad. At the time, the Syrian president was at significant risk of losing control of his country to a disparate assortment of forces: US-backed groups including the YPG; Turkish-backed forces; Islamic State; al-Qaida; and others.\n\nRussia had several reasons to back Assad. He was a friend to Moscow, as his father had been before him. The Kremlin was concerned that if he fell, chaos would ensue \u2013 or Isis would fill the void. From a geo-strategic perspective, Russia had long opposed US-backed \u201cregime change\u201d interventions and was disinclined to let one more succeed. It was also keen to build influence in the Middle East and show itself to be a reliable partner. And while its involvement was in direct opposition to US efforts, Moscow likely believed that once it had proven itself a force to be reckoned with, it could establish its relevance to the US and cut some kind of arrangement with the Americans on the future of Syria and fight against Isis, thereby further cementing its great-power status and helping rebuild the two countries\u2019 relationship.\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Syria had a decisive effect, reversing Assad\u2019s slide. Cooperation with the Americans, however, proved elusive. But while Washington didn\u2019t want to carve up influence and share it, a different dynamic nonetheless emerged. Erratic and shrinking US involvement, together with Moscow\u2019s diplomatic skill, has now left Russia in what might seem an enviable position in Syria and in the region as a whole.\n\nAll of this has been on display over the past fortnight, since Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from Syria for the third time in 18 months \u2013 this time combined with a tacit green light for Turkey to move into territory in Syria\u2019s north-east controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG plays a leading role. Russia, for its part, has brokered a tactical arrangement between the YPG and Assad, supported Assad\u2019s troops as they moved toward the border, kept them and Turkish forces at a distance from one another and,now, struck a deal with Ankara.\n\nAs Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow\u2019s lead will likely diminish further\n\nMaintaining good relations with all sides has been at the centre of Moscow\u2019s Middle East strategy. Unlike the US, which has historically divided the region into friends and enemies, Russia has taken a pragmatic approach. Where it has common interests with a country, it pursues them in cooperation. Where it disagrees, it accepts that each party will do what it can to get what it wants, even as they continue to coordinate on other matters. A lack of interest in criticising other countries for human rights violations (Russia itself is credibly accused of targeting civilians in Syria) rounds out a package bound to appeal to many Middle Eastern governments.\n\nAs partner to all and ally to few, Moscow has been able to simultaneously protect the Syrian regime, turn a blind eye to Israeli strikes against Iranian assets, and help Israel and Iran avoid accidental clashes. It is also steadily improving its relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut while Moscow\u2019s current position in the Middle East appears advantageous, it presents challenges. As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow\u2019s lead, already tenuous, will likely diminish further. Russia\u2019s relationship with Ankara does offer some continued leverage over Damascus. So, to an extent, does its pledge to protect the interests and security of the Kurdish community. However, neither Damascus nor Ankara is likely to make any real concessions to the YPG, raising questions of just what Moscow can deliver \u2013 and how long it can maintain good relations with all three parties.\n\nLooking ahead, Russia\u2019s goals are unchanged. It still desires Assad\u2019s control of a stabilised Syria and global acceptance of his continued rule, as well as guaranteeing its own long-term influence in the region. At the same time, it does not want to maintain a substantial military commitment in Syria, although it will likely seek a base or two.\n\nAssad seems well on the way to re-establishing control. But despite the deal with Ankara, stability, and thus Russian withdrawal, will be harder to achieve. Not only is resolution in the north-east far from assured, the northwest, where Idlib remains in jihadist hands, presents an equally complicated Gordian knot. Moreover, the reconstruction that would make peace sustainable requires resources beyond the means of Syria and Russia. International help and support might be more forthcoming if the YPG get a better deal and Idlib is resolved without a bloodbath, but Assad and Moscow will balk at demands for a political transition.\n\nRussia\u2019s impressive juggling act in the Middle East, and in Syria in particular, has left it in a powerful position. But by filling the vacuum left by the US, it has had to take on far more responsibility than it may have expected or sought. To date it has managed well, but with few easy choices ahead and Syria in its current state, this may not be an enviable prize.\n\n\u2022 Olga Oliker directs the Europe and Central Asia programme at International Crisis Group", "description": "Russia\u2019s deal with Turkey is the latest in a smart power-broking strategy that will soon be tested to its limits, writes Olga Oliker of the International Crisis Group", "authors": ["Olga Oliker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16da2f4c204343f0582690dc91c256de4f7ab4d8/0_2_3193_1916/master/3193.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8fcbe4ea0029aa1e12db92fa5f05612c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
