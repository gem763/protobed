But Mr Silver has defended his right to express his opinion.\n\n\"We were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\" Silver said. \"We said there's no chance that's happening. There's no chance we'll even discipline him.\"\n\n\"The values of the NBA - the American values, we are an American business - travel with us wherever we go. And one of those values is free expression.\"\n\nMr Silver said he understood the point of view that the NBA should withdraw from all activities in China, due to authoritarian nature of the regime but said the NBA felt that \"constructive engagement, especially in sports, is very positive\".", "description": "The US basketball league pays the price for comments backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14728/production/_109125738_gettyimages-1033511522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
