(AP) - Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is joining Democratic lawmakers to support a repeal of Michigan\u2019s abortion restrictions and regulations.\n\nThe legislation introduced Tuesday won\u2019t advance in the Republican-led Legislature. But the Democratic governor said it\u2019s important to advocate for the proposed Michigan Reproductive Health Act because residents \u201cvalue a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\n\nThe bills would repeal an unenforced 1931 law that bans virtually all abortions, remove a parental consent requirement and lift a 24-hour waiting period.\n\nThe legislation would reinforce abortion rights at a time states have passed restrictions conservatives hope will lead the Supreme Court to review Roe v. Wade.\n\nMichigan anti-abortion groups are circulating petitions to significantly restrict a common second-trimester procedure and ban abortion as early as six weeks. The Legislature could bypass Whitmer and enact the measures.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gov.
