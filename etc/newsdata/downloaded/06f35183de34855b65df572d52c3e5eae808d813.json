The very air around the area holds the knowledge of what this patch of land staged and witnessed.\n\nThe Partizan Stadium is both the ground where the Busby Babes played their last ever match, and from where they were returning when the Munich air disaster took place, as well as where Sir Matt himself feared the dream that drove that legendary team died.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They knocked Busby\u2019s buoyant side out of the semi-finals of the 1965-66 European Cup, shattering his belief that he would ever lift that great trophy. Busby was left devastated, tears in is eyes, wondering whether it was even worth going on.\n\nIn that, however, Partizan and their stadium should also offer a grandiose reminder as much as memories. They should remind of the value of persistence; of spirit.\n\nUnited and Busby had already displayed this qualities just to get back to Belgrade \u2013 and a European Cup semi-final \u2013 in 1966. It certainly didn\u2019t seem possible amid the tragic wreckage of 1958, when eight of his team died in Munich, or even the dysfunctional club left behind in 1962.\n\nBusby and assistant Jimmy Murphy fought on, though, and gradually put together one of the continent\u2019s great sides. All of that came together in the 1965-66 quarter-final, when a team exhilarated by George Best won 5-1 away at Benfica. It was a night, Charlton said in his autobiography, \u201cwhen our old team hit its highest level of performance\u201d, when they all \u201cunderstood most completely what it was all about\u201d.\n\nMore emotionally, it had been United\u2019s finest display in Europe since the days of the Babes, and that last game away to Red Star Belgrade in 1958. That game was moved to the stadium of their great rivals Partizan for capacity purposes, and saw United move on to another level. They were simply \u201cdazzling\u201d amid the Belgrade cold. Already 2-1 up from the first leg, Busby\u2019s young side roared into a 3-0 lead by the half-hour, with Charlton scoring two goals in two minutes. Red Star\u2019s second-half comeback to make it 3-3 was irrelevant. The impression had been made. The semi-final had been made.\n\nAn aura had been fully restored, and even made greater by Best.\n\nThat could be seen from Partizan\u2019s performance in the first half of the first leg of the semi-final.\n\n\u201cThe Yugoslavs were terrified of us,\u201d Harry Gregg told Eamon Dunphy in his exceptional book, \u2018A Strange Kind of Glory\u2019. \u201cThey\u2019d read of the mighty Manchester United back in all our glory. They were mesmerised by the very name and that\u2019s how they played in the first half.\u201d\n\nThe problem, however, was United\u2019s own performance wasn\u2019t at the level they had reached in the quarter-final.\n\nFor a start, this certainly wasn\u2019t the Best who\u2019d played in the quarter-final. He\u2019d suffered a cartilage injury in the FA Cup sixth-round win over Preston North End that was to subsequently end his season, but Busby couldn\u2019t countenance leaving him out for this biggest of games. The great Scot felt they were on the brink. He\u2019d never felt closer. The same applied to the entire squad.\n\nAnd this was the other problem. If United were not physically the same, with Best struggling, the similarly unfit Denis Law would reveal they were mentally off too.\n\n\u201cThat was definitely the year when we should have won the European Cup,\u201d Law told Joe Lovejoy for his authorised biography of Best. \u201cBut perhaps we were too confident. We thought all we had to do was turn up to get the result we needed. We were wrong, of course.\u201d\n\nThe emotional impact of actually drawing Belgrade should not be understated either. \u201cIt would have been impossible to come up with a match that carried any heavier load of emotion,\u201d Charlton wrote.\n\nBusby, for his part, hid any sense of this on the eve of the game. \u201cManchester United have never played for a draw and we will not start now!\u201d\n\nThey just didn\u2019t really start to play at all. They were dominant\u2026 but flat, illustrated by Best. A bad sixth-minute miss illustrated the folly of starting him. At half-time, substitute Noel Cantwell told teammates that a goal would be a matter of time. Those playing felt otherwise.\n\n\u201cPartizan were a different team in the second half, they\u2019d realised they\u2019d overestimated us and began to play,\u201d Gregg said.\n\nNone realised it more than manager Abdulah Gegic, a tactician who Real Madrid had been looking at. Partizan caught United cold immediately after half-time, with raiding full-back Jusufi setting up Mustafa Hasanagic for the opener. That was the spark, as the Serbians began to lay siege. Within 13 minutes, it was 2-0, as Radoslav Becejac fired past Gregg. Best and Law were barely able to run, as Velibor Vasovic \u2013 who later be prove an influential member of Rinus Michel\u2019s great Ajax team \u2013 ran the game.\n\nPartizan won 2-0 and celebrated as if they were to lift the European Cup. Busby publicly didn\u2019t reveal his disappointment at that point, but he privately feared a great chance had gone.\n\nGregg, for his part, blamed his manager to Dunphy.\n\n\u201cOur team talk was the usual, go out and enjoy yourselves, play it as it comes. That\u2019s what we\u2019d always done. We made no adjustments, which you have to do in the away leg of a European tie.\u201d\n\nWhereas Partizan did. \u201cThey were well drilled, physically and psychologically prepared to defend. They were able to adapt tactics to the needs of that particular situation.\u201d\n\nAnd United struggled to adapt to this situation. They weren\u2019t yet out, and there was still the prospect of a European night at Old Trafford, but there wasn\u2019t the same belief. There wasn\u2019t the same team. Best couldn\u2019t play, and was replaced by youth player Willie Anderson.\n\nNone of it was enough. United did get a late goal through Nobby Stiles, and Partizan did await an onslaught. Gegic abandoned any tactical pretensions and simply roared \u201cdefend for your lives!\u201d\n\nThat translated into some hugely aggressive tactics, that eventually saw Crerand lash out with a punch and get sent off\u2026 but it may not have been needed.\n\nUnited were displaying their own frustration. They couldn\u2019t make the breakthrough. They couldn\u2019t reach \u201cthe top of the mountain\u201d.\n\nAfterwards, there were tears in Busby\u2019s eyes. No one else in the dressing room spoke. Those there said he looked \u201csick\u201d, \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d, \u201cdevastated\u201d.\n\nGregg tried to go to him and say the better team lost but Busby \u201cjust shrugged his shoulders and smiled that resigned smile of his\u201d.\n\n\u201cI felt sorry for him.\u201d\n\nWhen everyone else left, Busby eventually turned to Crerand and lamented: \u201cWe\u2019ll never win the European Cup now.\u201d\n\nCrerand attempted to reassure him, insisting they\u2019d go again, but admitted to Andy Mitten this week he scarcely believed it himself.\n\nBusby didn\u2019t believe he could go again. He said he should retire.\n\n\u201cHe spoke about it,\u201d Wilf McGuinness told Lovejoy. \u201cBut the players didn\u2019t want him to go\u2026 Louis Edwards, the chairman, wasn\u2019t ready for a change then.\u201d\n\nBusby\u2019s wife Jean didn\u2019t think Sir Matt was really ready to give up either. And that was proven by one little moment of fate a few days later, when the great man was on his way to Old Trafford for training.\n\n\u201cI was fed up and everything else, but driving along I stopped at the crossing near the blind school,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere I witnessed seven little children with sticks being led across the road. I just sat in the car and thought, \u2018Matt what problems have you got? You\u2018ve got no problems compared to these poor kids.\u2019 At that moment I thought one more go. Just one more go!\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was enough. Lessons were learned. Strides were made. That final step was made. Busby, and United, persevered.", "description": "As Sir Bobby Charlton walked back up to the Partizan Stadium in 1966, he remembered thinking he was \u201cretracing footsteps that never ceased to haunt us\u201d.
