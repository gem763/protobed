Furthermore, Rand Water will ensure that prior to the commencement of the shutdown, all reservoirs supplying the City will be filled to capacity to ensure water supply during the shutdown period,\" he further explained.\n\nThe city's reservoirs have the capacity to supply water for two days.\n\nHowever, De Jager has still urged residents to use water sparingly during the maintenance period.\n\n\"We appeal to residents to use water sparingly during the shutdown in order to avoid a complete no-water situation and reminds all customers that Level 1 water restrictions are still in place,\" he said.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The City of Johannesburg has urged residents not to panic ahead of 54-hour planned service interruption from Rand Water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8006/61b14f49bf77434da7fb6e5a21571b39.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-21"}
