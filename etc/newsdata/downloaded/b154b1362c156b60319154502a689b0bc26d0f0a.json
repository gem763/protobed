They should be protected while in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is not something that should happen.\n\nKaden died in August, on the second day of the academic year at William T Dwyer High School, pictured (Picture: Google Maps)\n\n\u2018I trusted them.\n\n\u2018This is a nightmare. A nightmare.\u2019\n\nMichelle explained that Kedar\u2019s plan stipulated that his food be cut into chunks, that each bite be washed down with a drink, that he should be offered help using the restroom and not allowed to wander alone.\n\nBut a medical examiner\u2019s report said Kedar began choking on a large piece of food while a health aide was supervising him and another student in the school cafeteria.\n\nIt said that Kedar was eating nuggets when he got up abruptly and walked to a nearby window.\n\nThe report continued: \u2018As he was returning to the table, he appeared in distress \u2026 (he) started gasping and he appeared to be choking.\n\n\u2018He collapsed to the floor, and the health aid called for help.\u2019\n\nFirst aiders performed the Heimlich maneuver on Kedar, and managed to dislodge some food from his throat.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital, and declared dead around an hour after the incident began.\n\nA supervisor who worked solely with Kedar was no longer able to do so from the day of his death.\n\nThat meant another aide was working with both Kedar and another student, despite the teenager\u2019s plan stating he required one on one care.\n\nMichelle Williams is outraged at what she says was neglect that led to her son\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA medical examiner ruled that the tragedy was an accident.\n\nMichelle Williams is now working with a lawyer to determine whether she can file a lawsuit against William T Dwyer High Scool.\n\nA school spokesman declined to comment.", "description": "Kader Williams suffered severe autism, and needed constant supervision as well as food cut into manageable pieces.
