I felt like food was the only thing there for me and never let me down.\n\n\"Before I lost weight, I felt awful about myself. I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and completely trapped in my body. I had given up and just came to terms that this was how my life was supposed to be.\n\n\"I kind of accepted it and pretended to be happy on the outside.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Angela Gerzanics)\n\n\"I decided to make a drastic change and take control of my health. I have two kids who need me - and they need all of me, not just a shell of a mum.\n\n\"They needed me to heal mentally, physically, and emotionally. Of course, I was always there for them, but I knew I could do better as their mum, so I did.\"\n\nSince losing 10st 8lb, Angela's self-confidence has grown emphatically and now she even enjoys running around with her children in the park something she never believed would be possible.\n\nAngela says that her body may never look 'perfect', but she has so much appreciation for what her body has been through, and the added bonus of being able to walk into any shop and know they cater to her size is an added bonus.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Angela Gerzanics)\n\n\"I was a stay at home mum for a few years but then I got a job with great health benefits. I used those medical benefits to have weight loss surgery.\n\nOn August 24, 2016 I had gastric sleeve surgery and it forever changed my life. It was the beginning of my healing,\" said Angela.\n\n\"My diet before weight loss surgery was McDonald's drive thru on my way home from work and everything from the freezer section in the supermarket. The more processed the better, and I was constantly having lots of sweets and sugary drinks.\n\n\"Now when me and my family go grocery shopping, we spend most of our time shopping the fresh produce, meat and dairy. We still consume some packaged foods, but we rarely go to fast food places, but it slips in every now and then.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Angela Gerzanics)\n\n\"Now I do my best to try to only eat whole foods and limit how much processed food I eat. I am far from perfect and sometimes I indulge, but I no longer eat to comfort my feelings, I eat because I want to, because it tastes good, not to suppress my feelings.\n\n\"I drink almost no sugary drinks anymore, mostly sticking to water or black coffee. I make it a point to drink no less than two litres of water a day, whereas before I would be lucky to get that much water in a week.\"\n\nAccording to Angela's Instagram account she now enjoys healthier meals including vegetarian omelettes for breakfast and grilled meats with avocado for an evening meals.\n\nShe also eats large portions of fresh fruit and vegetables daily.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Angela Gerzanics)\n\n\"Losing weight has completely changed my life, not just for myself but for my family. I can work a full shift at work now and take my kids to the park and run around all afternoon with them,\" she said.\n\n\"I can fit on rides and fully enjoy being out with my boys. I'm no longer the mum sitting on the side watching them.\n\n\"I feel so confident now after losing the weight.\n\n\"My body will never be perfect, but it doesn't matter to me. Being able to walk into any shop and buy what I want off the racks is amazing. It's the most freeing feeling ever. I was only able to shop at a few select shops before.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Angela Gerzanics)\n\n\"I finally love my body and my flaws. I have never been so at peace with myself than I am now. I used to be a tight size 32 and now I am a size 12! I can even shop in the teen section for some things.\n\n\"The hardest part for me was the mental battle. I love healthy food, but it was hard to switch my mindset to eat to live, not live to eat. Food controlled me for so long, so it was hard to take back control.\n\n\"People are genuinely shocked at how much weight I've lost. They are so happy for me and I have some great support.\n\n\"People who have known me my whole life still can't believe I was that big. It shocks us all ` myself included - that I lived that way for so long.\"\n\nTo see more visit www.instagram.com/gastric_sleeve_ang", "description": "Angela Gerzanics spent most of her life morbidly obese until she tried a new approach to slim down", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Angela Gerzanics"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554670.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Daily-McDonalds-Weight-Loss.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
