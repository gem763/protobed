We all know that we\u2019re better than our current politics. Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment.\u201d\n\nUnlike some former White House officials and Cabinet secretaries, Mattis has refrained from directly criticizing the president since he left government, although his resignation letter in December 2018 was widely viewed as an admonishment of the president\u2019s foreign policy posture.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Jim Mattis left the Trump administration over his disagreement with the president's order to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\u201cBecause you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,\u201d Mattis wrote to Trump at the time.\n\nIn his essay on Wednesday, Mattis alluded to the eventual fissure in his working relationship with Trump and emphasized his support for the United States\u2019 close strategic relationships with global partners.\n\n\u201cUsing every skill I had learned during my decades as a Marine, I did as well as I could for as long as I could,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cWhen my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nMattis earlier this month rejoined the board of directors of General Dynamics. He first became a member of the government contractor\u2019s board in August 2013 after retiring from the Marine Corps, but was required to resign , divest his stock and recuse himself from all matters involving the company for one year after he was confirmed as Defense secretary in January 2017.", "description": "\u201cUnlike in the past, where we were unified and drew in allies, currently our own commons seems to be breaking apart,\u201d Mattis wrote in an essay.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/60/113945eb40aab5c54d073096ed20/190828-jim-mattis-gty-773.jpg"}
