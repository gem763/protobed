The book, in part, details how Farrow\u2019s investigation into Weinstein was hindered at NBC News, how Weinstein may have pressured NBC executives to kill Farrow\u2019s story by threatening to reveal accusations against former \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer, and also includes a new allegation that Lauer had raped a colleague in 2014 at the Sochi Olympics. (Lauer has denied that the encounter was non-consensual.)\n\n\u201cWeinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior and capable of revealing it,\u201d Farrow writes in the book, according to passages published in The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday. And speaking with sources from NBC and AMI, the publisher for the National Enquirer, Farrow reports in his book that Weinstein was planning on using the Enquirer\u2019s findings on Lauer\u2019s workplace conduct to threaten NBC.\n\nNBC has denied that AMI contacted the network to threaten them over Farrow\u2019s reporting.\n\nAnd in a memo sent to NBC staffers on Wednesday, NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack denied the suggestion that NBC executives knew about the rape accusation and attempted to cover it up, or that the network had also been covering for Weinstein by preventing Farrow from publishing his findings.\n\nAlso Read: NBC News Chief Calls Ex-Anchor Matt Lauer's Conduct 'Reprehensible'\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer\u2019s conduct is absolutely false and offensive,\u201d Lack wrote before reiterating the network\u2019s decision not to run Farrow\u2019s piece because it did not meet NBC\u2019s standards for publication or broadcast.\n\nBut on Thursday during a morning meeting, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim had fielded critical questions from staffers about the extent to which NBC executives were aware of the rape accusation made against Lauer before he was fired. (Lauer was fired by NBC in Nov. 2017 following an internal review of sexual misconduct, the findings of which were released in May 2018.)\n\nWeinstein, meanwhile, faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of first-degree criminal sexual assault, one count of first-degree rape, and one count of third-degree rape. His criminal trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 6, 2020. He pleaded not guilty to his indictment in August.\n\nRead original story Harvey Weinstein Denies Pressuring NBC Over Ronan Farrow Reporting With Matt Lauer Allegations At TheWrap", "description": "Harvey Weinstein has denied pressuring NBC News over Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting into the disgraced movie mogul by threatening to reveal allegations against Matt Lauer.\u201cHarvey says that there is absolutely nothing factual about that account and he never did anything of the sort,\u201d a representative for Weinstein", "authors": ["J.
