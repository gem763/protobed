He didn\u2019t have to fight in the first or second rounds.\n\nWhen Eddie Alvarez withdrew due to injury at ONE Championship 100, Lee (12-3 MMA) stepped in on a week\u2019s notice to take on Saygid Guseyn Arslanaliev (8-1 MMA).\n\nThe event takes place Saturday at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.\n\nDespite showing up late to the party, Lee thinks fans should have no qualms about his entry. If he defeats Arslanaliev on Saturday, he has no issue calling himself the legitimate tournament winner.\n\nIn an interview with MMA Junkie, Lee argued Arslanaliev is the only tournament participant who earned his standing \u2013 with injuries forcing other fighters to be replaced by already-eliminated fighters.\n\n\u201cWith this grand prix, a lot of the fans are getting a bit confused with this,\u201d Lee told MMA Junkie. \u201cOn one hand, it is true that I was not in the grand prix. But every other competitor in the grand prix besides \u2018Dagi\u2019 himself was taken out of the grand prix due to injury or a loss and was able to jump back into the grand prix. So in my opinion, \u2018Dagi\u2019 is the only one who earned his spot to the finals.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lee, Alvarez\u2019s late withdrawal posed some issues for the promotion, which struggled to find a replacement. Despite already holding the ONE title, Lee didn\u2019t hesitate to save the day.\n\n\u201cThey were looking for a last-minute replacement for this fight after Eddie Alvarez got injured, and there was no one that was able to make it to Japan on time due to visa issues or just wasn\u2019t a high-enough contender for that spot,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI was the last person that they called for it. Typically, the champ would not step into the grand prix to fight for his own belt. But I didn\u2019t want to see that fight scrapped from the show and I wanted to make it happen.\u201d\n\nLike Lee, all of Arslanaliev\u2019s ONE victories have ended inside the distance. With 19 combined finishes between him and his opponent, Lee doesn\u2019t see this fight going the distance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting \u2018Dagi\u2019 to come out and do what he does to every single one of his opponents, which is come out fast, hard, and look for a quick finish,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think this matchup is going to make for a very exciting fight because we\u2019re both proven finishers.\n\n\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s no way this fight is going to the judges and I think the fans in Tokyo are in for a great fight.\u201d", "description": "Lightweight champ Christian Lee says fans are getting a bit confused by his tournament entry at ONE Championship 100: Century \u2013 Part 1.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Christian Stein", "Farah Hannoun", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/christian-lee-one-championship-96.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
