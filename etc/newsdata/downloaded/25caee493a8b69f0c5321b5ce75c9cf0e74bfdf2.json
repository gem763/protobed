REUTERS/Christinne Muschi/File Photo\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which ended its 11-day assembly on Friday, said it would weigh long-term options for reducing emissions from international flights that would be presented at its next assembly in 2022.\n\nTransport and Environment, a non-government organization that bills itself as Europe\u2019s leading clean transport advocacy group, said in a statement that the assembly \u201cfailed to take any significant steps to rein in the sector\u2019s emissions.\u201d\n\nBut the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines and other industry, said it was \u201cencouraged that there was clear support from governments meeting at ICAO to develop a UN-backed goal.\u201d\n\nMontreal-based ICAO, which holds an assembly every three years, had set a major climate initiative at its last full gathering in 2016, and aviation leaders were under pressure to do more after overall carbon emissions hit record highs last year.\n\nThis year\u2019s gathering, which began on Sept. 24, took place under the shadow of climate protests led by teenaged Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who drew hundreds of thousands to the streets in Montreal on Sept 27.\n\nCommercial flying accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, but its share of emissions is expected to rise as air travel becomes accessible to more travelers.\n\nICAO\u2019s 193 member countries overwhelmingly backed the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a medium-term plan to help airlines avoid adding to their net emissions from 2020.\n\nUnder CORSIA, which is due take effect in 2021 on a voluntary basis, airlines would purchase carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world if their emissions exceed agreed targets.\n\nBut representatives from China and India, along with Russia, argued that the CORSIA plan and the agency\u2019s separate efforts to come up with a long-term target would create an unfair burden on emerging and developing countries.\n\nChina - once an important early supporter of the 2016 U.N. plan - joined Russia ahead of the assembly in arguing CORSIA unfairly penalizes developing countries because it raises costs.\n\nAirlines have urged ICAO to commit now to setting longer-term goals to reduce emissions at its 2022 assembly.\n\nAnnie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), said \u201ccivil society will be watching to see that all airlines implement CORSIA with integrity.\u201d\n\nThe United States supports CORSIA even though U.S. President Donald Trump intends to pull the country out of a separate international agreement, the Paris climate protection deal that aims to reduce carbon emissions. Under the terms of the pact, that cannot formally happen before Nov. 4, 2020.", "description": "A U.N. agency agreed on Friday to prioritize studying options for a long-term goal to reduce aviation emissions aimed at combating climate change, but made no firm commitments and faced pushback from China and India.", "authors": ["Allison Lampert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437186331&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931PK", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
