Brazil's entire history ran through the Museum.\n\nAfter it burned down, Beatriz H\u00f6rmanseder, a palaeontologist working at the Museum, came up with a unique way to cope with the trauma of its loss. She got a tattoo of the building's facade and set up a project where other students and staff could do the same.\n\nVideo directed and edited by Luciani Gomes and produced by Maryam Maruf for Museum of Lost Objects, a radio and podcast series exploring the personal impact of cultural heritage destruction.", "description": "How staff and students from Brazil's National Museum are coping with the loss of the building after fire destroyed it last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/50E2/production/_108560702_p07m11jf.jpg"}
