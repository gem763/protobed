However, researchers at Kaspersky identified mistakes in the crytopgtaphy of Yatron, allowing them to create the decryptor.\n\nResearchers describe FortuneCrypt as a \"unique\" form of ransomware complied in the Blitz BASIC programming language \u2013 and the first form of file-encrypting malware to be coded in this way.\n\nDespite the relatively simple programming language, FortuneCrypt has been deployed in thousands of attacks that threaten to delete files forever if payment isn't received in 24 hours.\n\nHowever, researchers found that the cryptography of FortuneCrypt is weak, allowing them to build a decryption tool.\n\nIn addition to this, researchers at Emsisoft have released a free decryption tool for WannaCryFake \u2013 a phoney version of WannaCry, the ransomware that came to prominence in the global cyberattack of 2017.\n\nSEE: Ransomware: 11 steps you should take to protect against disaster\n\nVictims of the WannaCryFake find their files encrypted with .WannaCry and are faced with a ransom note demanding a Bitcoin payment in exchange for returning the files. Now those who become infected by WannaCryFake can download the free decryption tool from Emsisoft to get their files back without paying.\n\nResearchers at Emisisoft have also released a free decryption tool for Avest ransomware. Download links to other decryption tools are also available from the No More Ransom decryption portal.\n\nNo More Ransom now offers free decryption tools for over a hundred families of ransomware and, since launching three years ago, the initiative has stopped over $100m from being paid to cyber criminals.\n\nMORE ON CYBER CRIME", "description": "Cybersecurity researchers crack the codes of FortuneCrypt, Yatron, WannaCryFake and Avest ransomware, allowing victims to get their files back without paying cyber criminals.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/bd2481de-d5af-4c10-962c-3f04cc7b22a6/thumbnail/770x578/24fc5a80b9d96304e3571f5ddc9433f6/victim-of-a-ransomware-attack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
