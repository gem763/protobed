REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nMichelle Obama has been urged by fans to run for president. While she\u2019s said no, new findings suggest maybe she should reconsider.\n\nA Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found that if the former first lady were to enter the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary race, she would have the lead among the current candidates.\n\n\u201cIf Michelle Obama were to enter the race, it would change things dramatically,\u201d pollster R. Kelly Myers wrote in the report. \u201cTwenty-six percent of Democrats would vote for her, making her the new front-runner. Under this scenario, Obama (26 percent) would lead Warren (20 percent), (Biden (20 percent) and Sanders (15 percent). She would take away 4 points from Warren, 4 points from Biden and 7 points from Sanders.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s memoir Becoming was released in November 2018 and quickly became one of the best-selling memoirs of all time. Her book tour sold out stadiums and her popularity has been peaking, which has led to calls for her to return to the White House in a more presidential capacity. In an August interview with The National, Obama hardened her resolve about the impossibility of her running for the highest office in the nation saying that there was \u201czero chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to improve this country and build a better world, and I keep doing plenty of them, from working with young people to helping families lead healthier lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office will never be one of them. It\u2019s just not for me.\u201d\n\nShe also told Conan O\u2019Brien back in March that eight years in the White House was \u201cenough. It is enough. It's time for new ideas ... and people who are struggling in ways that, because of the nature of what we've done, we don't do that anymore. We need fresh, real, clear eyes in this stuff.\"\n\nAccording to the Boston Herald, the FPU-Herald poll also found that there has been a 17 point drop in support for President Donald Trump from Republican voters going from 88 percent to 71 percent in just a month\u2019s time. When it comes to the Democratic race in the Granite State primary, the poll noted that it currently has Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden tied for the top spot while Bernie Sanders trails slightly behind.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nKate Middleton\u2019s wardrobe pays homage to Princess Diana in Pakistan\n\nBill requiring prescription for most sunscreens called 'terrible' idea by experts\n\nAlicia Keys opens up about her 'self-worth issues' on 'Red Table Talk': 'I feel I'm not deserving of greatness'\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Michelle Obama has been urged by fans to run for president.
