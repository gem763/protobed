ETH price might correct higher, but it is likely to struggle near $185.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few hours, there was a sharp decline in Ethereum, bitcoin, ripple, and major other cryptocurrencies against the US Dollar. ETH price tumbled below the $200 and $185 support levels. Moreover, there was a close below the $185 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The decline was such that the price crashed close to $150 on the Kraken exchange. A new monthly low was formed near $152 and the price is currently correcting higher.\n\nThere was a break above the $165 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $210 high to $152 swing low. The price is now trading above the $170 level, but there are many hurdles on the upside near the $180 and $182 levels. Moreover, there is a new major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $182 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe trend line coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $210 high to $152 swing low. More importantly, the previous support near the $185 level might once again act as a resistance. Above $185, Ethereum price could recover towards the $200 resistance area and the 100 hourly SMA. Conversely, the price could complete the current correction near the $180 or $185 resistance.\n\nAn initial support on the downside is near the $165 level. If there is a fresh decrease below $165, the price may perhaps retest the $152 low. Any further losses could push the price below the $150 support area in the coming sessions.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly back in a downtrend with a close below $200 and $185. As long as the price is below the $185 and $200 resistances, it remains at a risk of another drop towards the $150 support in the near term.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is about to move back into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently correcting higher from the 10 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $165\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $185", "description": "Ethereum price is back in a downtrend below $185 versus the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin below $10,000.
