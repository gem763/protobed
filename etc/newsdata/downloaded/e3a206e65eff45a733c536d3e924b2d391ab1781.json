Many saw the extradition bill as a glaring example of the Chinese territory's eroding autonomy since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.\n\nThousands of Hong Kong protestors stream past US consulate pushing for more vocal American support in fight against China.

Beijing and the entirely state-controlled media have portrayed the protests as an effort by criminals to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.\n\nProtesters on Sunday urged Washington to pass a bill, known as the Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Act, to support their cause. The bill proposes sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials found to suppress democracy and human rights in the city, and could also affect Hong Kong's preferential trade status with the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. State Department in a travel advisory Friday said Beijing has undertaken a propaganda campaign \"falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.\" It said U.S. citizens and embassy staff have been the target of the propaganda and urged them to exercise increased caution.\n\nProtesters called on U.S. President Donald Trump to 'liberate Hong Kong' during a march on Sunday. (Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters)\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers have spoken out strongly in support of the Hong Kong protesters and voiced concern about the potential for a brutal crackdown by China.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, however, has indicated the U.S. would stay out of a matter he considers between Hong Kong and China. He has said he believes the U.S. trade war with China is making Beijing tread carefully.\n\nSunday's rally followed overnight violent clashes between protesters and police at several metro stations.\n\nProtesters set fire to debris near a metro station that had been shuttered in the crowded Mongkok area but retreated after riot police chased them using pepper spray.\n\nViolent clashes separately took place at a station in Sha Tin new town, where protesters chased police officers into the control room before riot police arrived. Several people were injured and detained.", "description": "Demonstrators in Hong Kong marched to the U.S. Consulate on Sunday, urging U.S. President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" them as they press for more democratic freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275148.1567922971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hongkong-protest.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
