Richie Incognito commits dumb penalty, costs Oakland field goal try", "language": "en", "text": "One of the Oakland Raiders\u2019 resident punks had to fly home from London before Sunday\u2019s game with the Chicago Bears after the NFL suspended Vontaze Burfict for the remainder of the season after a filthy helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis\u2019 Jack Doyle last Sunday.\n\nApparently not wanting to be left out, Oakland\u2019s other well-known punk, Richie Incognito, started his dirty play early against the Bears.\n\nUnnecessary roughness\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOh hey, Richie Incognito did something stupid. Shocking. (Getty Images)\n\nThe Raiders and Bears are playing at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the first NFL game in that new facility.\n\nOakland got the ball first, and made solid progress against the Bears\u2019 defense, which so far has been one of the best in the league.\n\nFacing third-and-10 from the Chicago 28, running back Jalen Richard picked up 7 yards, putting Oakland at the 21 and giving kicker Daniel Carlson a roughly 40-yard field goal. As Richard was taken down by two Bears, Incognito came in a little late, landing on his own teammate but also defensive back Buster Skrine.\n\nAs he was getting up, Incognito used the back of Skrine\u2019s helmet to push off of, mushing Skrine\u2019s face into the turf.\n\nThe unnecessary roughness penalty cost Oakland 15 yards, pushing it out of field-goal range.\n\nThe Raiders punted away the ball.\n\nLater in the first half, Incognito was flagged again with the Raiders once again in field-goal range, this time for a chop block. That time Oakland did recover and scored field goal.\n\nOakland went on to a surprising 24-21 win.\n\nIncognito, who did not play in 2018, was suspended for the first two games of this season for a few disturbing incidents over the previous year, including throwing a weight at a stranger at a workout facility and threatening to shoot up a funeral home after the death of his father.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Apparently not wanting to be left out, Oakland\u2019s other well-known punk, Richie Incognito, started his dirty play early against the Bears.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5L7BGQPRYzmQGRx6kOHq2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzIuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N1ADjhtXXDW6H5AxSoF4oA--~B/aD0yNzA0O3c9Mzk2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/373e43d0-e861-11e9-9faf-732f66878632", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
