But sludge has kept pouring in \u2014 and some of it is coming through Trump-world from foreigners who are trying to buy sway with the president and his advisers.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, were arrested on Thursday and charged with trying to aid Ukrainian and Russian foreign nationals by secretly directing $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC. And they are only the latest in a string of money-men and women connected to Trump \u2014 including possible Middle Eastern donors to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, Mar-a-Lago neighbor Cindy Yang, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and imprisoned former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort \u2014 who have come under scrutiny since 2016 over funneling foreign money into American politics.\n\nThe string of allegations reveal gaping holes in America\u2019s defenses against foreign influence in its politics and elections, stretching far beyond the inadequate cybersecurity that Russian hackers exploited in 2016. These weaknesses are codified in U.S. campaign finance law, which legislators have refused to update in recent years despite persistent warnings from watchdogs and regulators about their vulnerability to foreign abuse.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dangerous trend,\u201d said Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, who likened American elections to a blowout college party \u2014 and American laws to the cavalier bouncers a boisterous fraternity might employ.\n\n\u201cWe have a great big money party and foreigners are going to want to participate,\u201d Painter continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a big party on a college campus but saying students under 21 can\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nDemocrats blame Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 like his private ask of Ukraine and public goading of China to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family \u2014 for why more foreigners feel inclined to be involved in elections, while Republicans continued to defend the president. But people in both parties aisle are troubled by the uptick in foreigners trying to illegally spend their way into American politics.\n\n\u201cThis is something that I believe is an increasing issue,\u201d said one Republican election lawyer, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about issues relating to his work. \u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with foreign money, pretty much everyone agrees that it\u2019s not allowed. You\u2019re dealing with nefarious actors who are intentionally circumventing the law.\u201d\n\nProbes examining Trump\u2019s fundraising date back to his 2016 campaign, a time when those raising money for the president were hungry for donors to help propel his insurgent bid for office.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been probing whether a pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, and the fund that raised money for Trump\u2019s inauguration accepted donations from American shell contributors serving as conduits for foreign money \u2014 called \u201cstraw donors\u201d \u2014 while Trump associate Tom Barrack was fundraising for the groups. The donations may have come from countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to a report in The New York Times.\n\nAccording to the indictment released Thursday, Parnas and Fruman allegedly created another straw donor, a fake company called Global Energy Producers LLC, that they used to donate to pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and another committee.\n\nThe donations helped Parnas and Fruman \u201cgain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with other politicians,\u201d while they worked to advance their own business goals and that of at least one Ukranian government official they were working on behalf of.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman (center) in federal court Thursday.
