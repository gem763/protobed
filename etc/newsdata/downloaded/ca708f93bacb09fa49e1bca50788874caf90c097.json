She\u2019s willing to scrimp a bit more the month before a holiday, for instance for a train trip to Croatia. Not only has this turned her into \u201ca bit of a train geek\u201d, it also taps into a worldwide movement for slower travel. This involves seeing the journey itself as a key part of the experience, where the traveller is forced to be aware of the distance and transitions between locations.\n\nAccording to Kemp, 10:10 decided to focus on leisure rather than business travel because of the growth of leisure travel (which currently makes up the majority of international travel). Sixteen employers have signed up to Climate Perks so far, including a credit union and an architecture firm, and organisations in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. In exchange for pledging to allot at least two low-carbon travel days per employee per year, the companies are given a benefits policy document they\u2019re free to adjust, as well as accreditation and a brand boost.\n\nCould this trend spread?\n\nGlen, the HR and office manager looking forward to skiing in France next year, acknowledges that this might not appeal to a company narrowly focused on the bottom line. \u201cIf people aren\u2019t working, then that\u2019s billable time that we wouldn\u2019t be getting.
