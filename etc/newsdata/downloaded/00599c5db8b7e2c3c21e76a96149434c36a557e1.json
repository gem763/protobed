Sign up here.\n\nThe European Central Bank cut interest rates further below zero and will start open-ended bond purchases after President Mario Draghi overcame critics of his stimulus policies to make a final run at reflating the euro-area economy.\n\nThe Governing Council reduced the deposit rate to minus 0.5% from minus 0.4%, and will buy debt at 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month starting Nov. 1. Banks will get exemptions from the negative rate for some of their deposits after an outcry from lenders about the squeeze on profitability. Draghi will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt.\n\nFollow Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in our live blog\n\nEuropean government bonds rallied on the announcement, led by a surge in Italian securities that sent 10-year yields to a record low, and credit spreads tightened. The dovish policy shift weighed on the euro, which weakened against its major counterparts, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose to its highest level since July.\n\nThe ECB also changed its guidance on interest rates to say they\u2019ll stay at present or lower levels until the outlook for inflation \u201crobustly\u201d converges to its goal of just below 2%. It previously expected borrowing costs to stay unchanged until mid-2020. It also scrapped a 10-basis point rate premium previously attached to its long-term loan program.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the ECB is \u201cacting quickly\u201d while the Federal Reserve \u201csits, and sits, and sits.\u201d He has previously cited loose ECB policy in his calls for the Fed to cut rates aggressively.\n\nThe Fed is likely to lower borrowing costs next week for the second time this year, as central banks around the world ease to combat the spreading weakness.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s announcement of a new stimulus package is a remarkable turn of events, just nine months after it signaled it was done with ever-looser policy. Now inflation is running at barely half the goal, and the manufacturing sector is in a contraction that risks spreading to the rest of the economy.\n\nHours before the decision, industrial-production figures showed the third quarter off to a weak start with euro-zone output dropping 0.4% in July, more than expected. The decline was led by Germany, which is on the verge of a recession as a global slowdown in trade caused by the U.S.-China standoff and the uncertainties surrounding Brexit hurts its exporters.\n\nThe approval of such broad measures is a win for Draghi in his penultimate meeting before he steps down next month. Governors from core economies including Germany and the Netherlands pushed back against the resumption of quantitative easing, saying it should be a last resort in case the outlook worsens.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say...\n\n\u201cThe overall ambition of the package is broadly in line with the Bloomberg Economics forecast. Asset purchases are smaller than the 45 billion a month we expected, though the open ended nature -- rather than the 12 months we expected -- and the tie-in to inflation dynamics means it could end up being very substantial.\u201d-- Jamie Rush and David Powell. See their ECB REACT\n\nStill, there are doubts the ECB\u2019s latest measures will prove as effective as hoped. Longer-term bond yields have already fallen sharply because of the economic slowdown, and another round of debt purchases might not exert much more downward pressure.\n\nAcademics have questioned the effectiveness of negative rates, with a recent study published by the University of Bath finding they decreased lending. The fact that the latest rate cut is accompanied by exemptions to soften the impact on banks will fuel those concerns. Lenders say they\u2019re forced to absorb most of the cost of negative rates, a charge on their overnight deposits at the central bank, because they can\u2019t easily be passed onto ordinary customers.\n\nSuch doubts over the remaining firepower of central banks have put the spotlight on fiscal stimulus. Draghi and his successor, Christine Lagarde, have both repeatedly called on governments to do more to bolster the economy.\n\n(Updates with markets, Trump tweet starting in third paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Jeannette Neumann, Zoe Schneeweiss, Aaron Eglitis, Iain Rogers and Brian Swint.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Yuko Takeo in Tokyo at ytakeo2@bloomberg.net;Piotr Skolimowski in Frankfurt at pskolimowski@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Gordon at pgordon6@bloomberg.net, Fergal O'Brien\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
