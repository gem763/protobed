But there is cause for hope with South Africa\u2019s 2020 agricultural performance. On 30 August 2019, the South African Weather Service released further evidence which reinforces this view. The agency noted that the central and eastern parts of South Africa could receive above-normal rainfall between November 2019 and January 20201. The weather outlook for the north-western regions of the country is unclear at this point, but we think there could be normal showers. It is quite rare to find a season where the north-eastern parts of South Africa experience above-normal rainfall while the western areas are dry, hence we are optimistic that the overall summer crop growing areas could receive sufficient rains in 2019/20 production season.\n\nThe planting season is due to start around mid-October in the eastern parts of South Africa, as shown in Figure 1. But we think there could be one-or-two-weeks delays in plantings in some areas that have lower soil moisture until the anticipated rainfall starts in November. Summer crop plantings in the north-western areas should commence on time, not only because of anticipated showers but generally improved soil moisture due to late 2019 summer rainfall and cool winter which preserved moisture in some areas.\n\nIn 2018/19 production season, most summer crop harvests fell by double-digit because of drier weather conditions at the start of the season. To zoom in on major crops in 2018/19 production season, maize, and production are respectively down by 12% y/y, 21% y/y and 24% y/y, to 11.02 million tonnes, 1.17 million tonnes and 680 940 tonnes. Assuming good weather conditions, there could be a notable upswing from these levels. For example, the International Grains Council\u2019s preliminary estimates for South Africa\u2019s 2019/20 maize production are 12.8 million tonnes, which would be 16% higher than the current season and slightly above the five-year average production of 12.3 million tonnes.\n\nThis would be a welcome development, not only by the summer crop farmers but also livestock farmers and agribusinesses. The livestock sector could benefit through potentially lower prices when the harvest increases. At the end of August 2019, South Africa\u2019s and prices were respectively up by 15% and 22% from the corresponding period last year because of the lower harvests in the 2018/19 production season. The agribusinesses could benefit in various ways, from improved grain volumes for storage and through lower prices in entities that use maize and other summer crops.\n\nThe optimistic outlook doesn\u2019t only lie rely on the potential recovery of summer crop production, but also winter crops and the horticultural sector. The Western Cape, which is amongst the key horticulture-producing provinces in the country, received good moisture in the past few weeks which improved soil moisture and water levels in dams. Going forward, the province is set to receive additional rainfall, all of which is conducive for the horticulture harvest of 2020, which would ultimately boost South Africa\u2019s agricultural economic fortunes. Over the coming weeks and months, we will closely monitor the weather developments as the optimistic picture we\u2019ve painted here depends on good rainfall.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Wandile Sihlobo covering: US Soybeans Futures, Sunflower Seed Futures, White Maize Futures, Yellow Maize Futures.
