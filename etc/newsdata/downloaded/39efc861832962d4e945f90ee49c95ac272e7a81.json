We are calling on everybody in the society to discuss it. Deadlines are something else,\u201d Magashule told City Press on the sidelines of the Students\u2019 Representative Council elections campaign at the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria on Wednesday.\n\nHe said in a meeting with the top six last Monday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni was encouraged to engage with alliance partners, including trade union federation Cosatu and the SA Communist Party (SACP).\n\n\u201cI am sure people will be given more time. The ANC will discuss the matter at the end of the month. So the deadline of September 15 will not be possible,\u201d said Magashule.\n\nHowever, Mboweni said on Friday that the return date of September 15 remained unchanged because \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d.\n\nMboweni said \u201csomething positive\u201d was unfolding, adding that \u201cthere is massive support from business, other formations, many economists, opinion makers and individuals both at home and abroad\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe key issue is to listen, analyse, question and integrate that which is internally consistent and improves the content and form of the Economic Strategy\u201d.\n\nHe said the country could not \u201cfiddle\u201d whilst we face massive challenges. \u201cSpeed, but not haste as they say. Forward forever, backwards never. The momentum of ideas must go on. Inertia must not set in\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cpremature\u201d release of the turnaround plan by the Treasury had left many in the ANC and its alliance partners fuming, with some saying that he should have consulted more widely, and others saying that Mboweni should have let President Cyril Ramaphosa own the document.\n\nThe SACP said it had not yet held a meeting with Mboweni.\n\n\u201cTo the extent he was encouraged to engage with ANC alliance partners we will listen to him and tell him where we stand, come from and want to go to,\u201d said party spokesperson Alex Mashilo.\n\nMashilo said that on August 19 the SACP held a bilateral meeting with Cosatu, as well as with the ANC separately.\n\nIt was agreed that an alliance process on the economic situation would be initiated. It would start by convening the Alliance Political Council to discuss, among other things, the \u201cserious economic situation we face and agree on a policy on the way forward\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe agreed alliance process remains a primary process organisationally and there is no substitute for it, even if it is important to encourage engagement through other processes and these should be mutually supportive rather than exclusionary.\u201d\n\nThe SACP held its augmented central committee meeting this weekend and resolved that Mboweni\u2019s economic paper violated the manner in which alliance partners were expected to consult each other, News24 reported.\n\nSACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said the SACP had not outright rejected the economic paper, but rejected some of its \u201cproposals and suggestions\u201d.\n\nCosatu first deputy president Mike Shingange said the trade union Federation had not met Mboweni and \u201cwe don\u2019t know when he intends to meet us, but we don\u2019t mind him it\u2019s the ANC we want to meet\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs for the deadline we will make our inputs once the document is presented at Nedlac. We don\u2019t want to input, we don\u2019t know it\u2019s authority as well as it\u2019s standing\u201d.", "description": "ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the deadline \u2013 next Sunday \u2013 set by Treasury to receive submissions on its 77-page economic turnaround strategy document will not be binding on ANC structures and members.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9302/9ab1d5daa9dd462ab65a0a83eab41bd9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
