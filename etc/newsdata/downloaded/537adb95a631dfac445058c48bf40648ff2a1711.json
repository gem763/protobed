With your co-operation, it also became about certain hardships and griefs in your current situation that you want us to understand.\n\nFor some, that has proved provocative to say the least.\n\nThey point out that none of your hardships \u2014 yes, even childhood bereavement and family estrangement \u2014 look particularly overwhelming next to the poverty, loss, maimings and uncertainties of life for millions on the African continent.\n\nThey wonder, too, why it didn't occur to either of you that airing your feelings may have distracted and detracted from theirs.\n\nSurely the fact that so many in those communities you visited literally dance in the face of so many challenges should have given you pause for thought.\n\nAs might the fact that, back home, many of those watching are themselves victims of loss and uncertainty, soldiering on without applause or complaint.\n\nMany also consider that a life cushioned by taxpayers is a fair swap for the privacy you crave and feel is being abused.\n\nYour critics will tell you that royals should put up with whatever comes their way, like the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the magnificently tough Princess Anne. There is a case for saying that if you're a royal you should 'never complain, never explain'; that is, carry on, smile when you're on duty and treat prying lenses and impertinent writers with a contemptuous shrug.\n\nYour critics will tell you that royals should put up with whatever comes their way, like the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh (pictured with prince Charles and Camilla in 2013) and the magnificently tough Princess Anne\n\nHowever, you have both made it clear that the pain of being looked at all the time is genuinely stressful. I do get that.\n\nNo half-normal people, apart from the most narcissistic celebrities, enjoy being stared at by millions of eyeballs and judged for every wardrobe change or slip of the tongue.\n\nAnd yes, I accept that the additional stress may have tainted the joys of marriage and motherhood. No new mother is 100 per cent confident.\n\nSo I cheered when presenter Tom Bradby asked you, Meghan: 'Can you manage it, can you continue . . . and what happens if you can't?' and you replied: 'It's not enough to just survive something. That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive and feel happy. I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried.'\n\nThen, disappointingly, you added that such an attitude 'is probably really damaging'.\n\nYou said you hadn't expected things to be easy, but you had expected them to be 'fair'.\n\nBut, Meghan, life isn't fair! Cancer and road accidents, disability, lightning strikes, flash floods, inheriting fat legs \u2014 none of it's fair.\n\nThat's why the British invented the stiff upper lip: not just for other people's sakes but because it does make you feel better.\n\nIt was not only the pressure of the scrutiny you are under, Harry, that ran through this documentary, but your deeper sorrow about losing a parent. How could it not, when you were filmed walking in your mother Diana's footsteps through an Angolan minefield?\n\nBut, Meghan, life isn't fair! Cancer and road accidents, disability, lightning strikes, flash floods, inheriting fat legs \u2014 none of it's fair, writes Libby Purves (pictured)\n\nI really wish, though, that Bradby hadn't introduced the dangerous idea of 'a wound that festers' when speaking of the impact of her death.\n\nWhen you agreed, Harry, I winced. Because if there is one thing I know from my own greatest loss \u2014 of a son \u2014 it's that you can't allow festering to happen. So in all humility and friendship, let me pass on a useful metaphor to you both.\n\nA friend whose wife was murdered told me that he was helped in his grief by remembering that in the trenches of World War I, most men died not of their wounds, but of the dirt that got into them and caused infection.\n\nWhenever emotions such as resentment, unfairness or self-pity crept into his thoughts, he'd say to himself: 'Clean wound!'\n\nI have used that clean-wound metaphor often. If some detail \u2014 like the click of a camera shutter, for you Harry, \u2014 reminds you of some awfulness, you face it down. You don't let it win.\n\nKeep the wound clean. Keep the good memories fresh. Private pain \u2014 or, as we often label it, 'poor mental health' \u2014 is real. Especially in grief. But we can control it.\n\nTwelve years ago, Harry, you made a speech at a memorial service to mark the tenth anniversary of your mother's death. It was perfect.\n\n'She made us and so many other people happy,' you said. 'May this be the way that she is remembered.'\n\nNot in resentment, not in fear and not as a 'festering wound'.\n\nIf the stiff upper lip fails you, you both have other things on which to rely. For one of you, it's the resilience of Army training and Army humour. For the other, a can-do American pioneer toughness. Work on those.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLibby.", "description": "Let me start by saying that there was much to admire in Sunday night's ITV documentary about your African tour (pictured) and the causes you support there.", "authors": ["Libpurves For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/22/20008142-0-image-a-83_1571691700593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
