We\u2019ll always be brothers.\n\n\"We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\n\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy.\n\n\"But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.\n\n\"Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nAn insider told the Times that that the brothers have spoken since the show aired on ITV on Sunday.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThey said: \"It's not surprising that in any family where you reach a new chapter, that takes a little time to settle back in and figure out your new routine and your new relationship as it is growing, going forward\n\n\"They have been in touch - as family members would.\n\n'It would be very difficult for anybody to watch that and not feel compassion for them. Whatever is going on is taking a personal toll on them. That, of course, would cause concern.\"\n\nMeghan also spoke of her struggles during the documentary , admitting that she's \"not OK\".\n\n(Image: UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nIn a one-to-one interview Meghan is asked about the \"true pressures of life in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both\".\n\nShe replies: \"Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you\u2019re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn \u2013 you know.\n\n\"And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it\u2019s, well\u2026\"\n\nShe then cuts to thank Tom for checking how she is doing.\n\n\"And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nFollowing up on her answer, Tom asks: \"And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\"\n\nMeghan pauses before replying simply: \"Yes\".", "description": "Prince Harry spoke about his relationship with brother Prince William during his documentary with wife Meghan Markle, admitting they have \"bad days\"", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty Images", "Itv", "Uk Press Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20071920.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Royal-Family-Attends-The-Commonwealth-Observance-Day-Service.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
