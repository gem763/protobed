(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Brad Pitt is on a panel with NASA officials, he\u2019s the one with the questions.\n\n\u201cIf we were going to make a trip to Mars, we would have to take off from the moon, because of the lack of gravity?\u201d he hesitantly asked spacesuit engineer Lindsay Aitchison Monday afternoon, as part of a Washington Post Live event centered on Pitt\u2019s latest film, \u201cAd Astra.\u201d Joining them were the writer-director, James Gray; lunar scientist Sarah Noble; and panel moderator Ann Hornaday, chief film critic at The Post.\n\nAitchison\u2019s affirmative response (\u201cIt\u2019s helpful\u201d), coupled with a distilled scientific explanation, was characteristic of much of her and Noble\u2019s responses to Pitt\u2019s earnest questions. He was soon outdone by an inquisitive Gray, who explained his granular knowledge of Neil Armstrong\u2019s talk-show appearances by joking, \u201cI don\u2019t get out much.\u201d\n\nGray\u2019s commitment to portraying space with accuracy over allure is obvious throughout \u201cAd Astra.\u201d The sci-fi thriller, set for a Friday release, takes place in the near future and centers on Maj. Roy McBride (Pitt), a skilled but emotionally worn astronaut recruited to determine and shut down the source of unbridled energy causing destructive power surges throughout the solar system. The source is believed to be near Neptune, which also happens to be the last known location of the Lima Project, a decades-old effort to discover extraterrestrial life commandeered by Roy\u2019s father (Tommy Lee Jones).\n\nRoy had long presumed his father to be dead, and the revelation that he might not be \u2014 and that the Lima Project might be causing the surges \u2014 leads Roy to embark on two journeys: the literal one to Neptune, and an equally harrowing exploration of solitude.\n\n\n\nPitt stares into the abyss in \u201cAd Astra.\u201d (Twentieth Century Fox)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other film that actually\u201d meditates on that topic, Pitt said. \u201cWe\u2019re usually dealing with benevolent aliens who are going to impart some wisdom, or they\u2019re going to destroy us and we have to stand up and fight. But this question of, what if we\u2019re actually alone? . . . What does that mean? Are we missing something?\u201d\n\nGiven that Pitt is largely seen on-screen alone, the film often forgoes interpersonal conversations as a means of establishing Roy\u2019s head space throughout the journey and favors voice-overs pulled from the daily psychological evaluations Roy must complete. (During the panel, Hornaday drew a parallel between this method and the narrative technique Francis Ford Coppola employed in \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we were after, in a sense,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWe have to look so far out that way to recognize that our interiority is what\u2019s really astounding.\u201d\n\nThough Pitt joked that he is the sort of actor who doesn't do much research beforehand, he and Gray frequently wondered how much \"Ad Astra\" got right. (The scientists seemed to skirt around this answer.) Nonetheless, the men conversed with Aitchison and Noble about the current state of NASA's lunar exploration \u2014 Noble said she hopes the moon will become a commercial destination within her lifetime \u2014 and tried on spacesuit gloves that Aitchison brought with her.\n\nPitt followed the panel\u2019s formal conclusion with a couple more questions of his own.\n\nThe first: Isn\u2019t it true that NASA is working on a rover that \u201cwill launch next year to Mars, that will collect samples, and then, they\u2019re working on the return of those samples to pave the way for the return of humans?\u201d Noble responded, \u201cVery good, yes!\u201d\n\nThe second: \u201cWho was more believable, Clooney or Pitt?\u201d\n\nAitchison and Noble laughed, and Pitt concluded, \u201cIt was Damon.\u201d", "description": "The actor chatted with NASA officials about exploration, both fictional and real, alongside director James Gray at a Washington Post Live event.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
