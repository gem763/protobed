He denies all accusations of non-consensual sex.\n\nThe trial will occur amid the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which was fueled by dozens of allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to say he was not guilty of committing sins,\u201d she said. However, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a rapist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think in many ways there are good things about #MeToo,\u201d the lawyer said. However, the empowerment movement \u201callows the court of public opinion to take over the narrative\u201d in a way that can\u2019t be corrected or challenged, which can result in the accused being \u201cstripped of your rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about making sure those issues don\u2019t cloud our ability to pick a fair jury,\u201d she said.\n\nNo matter happens at trial, she said, Weinstein \u201cwill pay the biggest price there is,\u201d because his life is ruined.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein said on Tuesday that her client is not without sin - but he's also not \"a rapist.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/sexual_misconduct_weinstein_64640_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
