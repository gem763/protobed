He was given nutritional shots and his tongue was normal within a month (pictured)\n\nThe patient was seen by doctors in Singapore who detailed the case in New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHis blood condition had caused atrophic glossitis, or inflammation of the tongue, which leads to changes in colour and texture of the muscle.\n\nIt is more commonly caused by acidic food and drink, spicy foods, or allergies - but vitamin deficiencies can trigger it.\n\nBlood tests revealed the patient's levels of vitamin B12 were very low, which can also lead to weakness and fatigue. It is not clear if the man had any other symptoms.\n\nWHAT IS PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA? Pernicious anaemia is when the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach, preventing the body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat. It this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK. Others are: Diet: Vitamin B12\u00ad is found only in foods that are animal based, therefore people who do not eat animal products are at risk of becoming deficient in B12. Those who exclude meat from their diet but do eat fish and dairy will be much less at risk of developing a deficiency.\n\nB12\u00ad is found only in foods that are animal based, therefore people who do not eat animal products are at risk of becoming deficient in B12. Those who exclude meat from their diet but do eat fish and dairy will be much less at risk of developing a deficiency. Medicine: Some medicines, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much vitamins B12 and B9 the body absorbs. Symptoms include extreme tiredness, a lack of energy, pins and needles (paraesthesia), a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers, muscle weakness, disturbed vision, psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion or problems with memory, understanding and judgement. Some of these problems happen if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate but do not have anaemia. Source: NHS\n\nThe patient's pernicious anaemia caused his immune system to kill proteins in the stomach which absorb the vitamin.\n\nHe was given an injection of the vitamin and, within one month, his tongue was back to normal.\n\nThe man will continue to have the B12 shots every month, the doctors said.\n\nPernicious anaemia affects just 0.1 per cent of the population, the NHS says.\n\nVitamin B12 is essential for the formulation of red blood cells, which transport oxygen around the body.\n\nTherefore, without it, red blood cells counts drop and a wide range of symptoms appear.\n\nGenerally, a deficiency in vitamin B12 can present as a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers or muscle weakness, according to the NHS.\n\nRed blood cells contain a protein called called myoglobin, which contributes to health muscles, including the tongue.\n\nSometimes pernicious anaemia is due to a diet lacking vitamin B12, which is found in meat, eggs and dairy products. Therefore, vegans are most at risk.\n\nVitamin B12 and B9 deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around one in 10 people aged 75 or over and one in 20 aged 65 to 74.\n\nPernicious anaemia represents up to 50 per cent of the causes of vitamin B12 deficiency in adults.", "description": "The unnamed 64-year-old was seen by doctors in Singapore.
