If it's a fashion startup, one token can be equal to one dress or a yearly license of a software in case of a hi-tech startup. You even can issue tokens of yourself and a token holder will be able to buy an hour of your work with the token. You can \u201ctokenize\u201d everything.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between cryptocurrency coins and tokens?\n\nThis is a difficult part. The easiest answer: tokens are not a currency. You don\u2019t need to create a Blockchain to issue tokens, which is a must-have for a cryptocurrency, but you use an existing one (usually Ethereum, which was originally created as a platform for smart contracts and evolved to be a currency).\n\nA coin is a money equivalent, something that defines value and serves as a value transfer.\n\nA token is a symbol of a contract, the value does not depend on mining, gold price or any dynamic market criteria. A friend of mine once gave me a note saying that he will always make me a coffee on demand. He still does it, after 10 years, it was a heck good token!\n\nWhat is a token contract and how does it work?\n\nOk, a token is not a coin, got it. But still, something should regulate it\u2019s transaction, value etc? How does that work? You do need a platform for it. Let\u2019s take Etherium as an example, since its one of the most popular platforms for smart tokens.\n\nHere is the full contract cycle:\n\nTokens creation: a company writes the basic rules (tokens amount, token value, special conditions). Once created the platform will serve as a very smart notary for all the future transactions, making sure all the conditions are carried out. Tokens acquisition: when somebody wants to buy a token, the process is really similar to buying a coke in a vending machine. You approach a machine, drop the coin and push the button \u201ccoke\u201d (choose the token you want to buy). The machine checks if there are \u201ccokes\u201d in stock and if you are eligible to buy it. If everything is fine- you get your drink (or token in our case). The machine says \u201chave a nice day\u201d and updates the stock info (one coke less now). Token transaction: In case you have a coke, you can just pass it to your friend. For money or for free. In tokens reality, you have your token wallet which is supported by the same platform that issued the token. You can transfer your token using the wallet. And again, a virtual notary, powered by a smart contract, will make sure you do it according to the rules. Moreover, all the wallets activity is constantly recorded and being updated.\n\nIs all this free? Nope. Somebody needs to pay for the notary, vending machine technician and coke delivery. In the token world \u2013 the operation processing called \u201cgas.\u201d So, each time you ask to buy or sell tokens, there will be some \u201cgas\u201d spent and you will pay its fee.\n\nNote: the fee is not static. It depends on a number of transactions awaiting. You can define the max cap you are willing to pay for your gas. If the token cost is, say, $10 and the gas fee is $20 is not a great deal, isn\u2019t it? So, you can say that you pay no more than $2 for your gas, click \u201csubmit\u201d and find something else to do meanwhile. The system will serve the highest gas bids first and eventually yours when your time will come. There is a chance, you will wait for a long time (if others are willing to pay more than you). But you always can rise the gas cap.\n\nTypes of tokens\n\nLet\u2019s see the most common types of tokens.\n\nToken \u2013 token (Utility tokens), the most popular type\n\nRemember amusements parks from the childhood? Roller coasters, carousels, hot dogs and cotton candy? At the entrance, you\u2019ve got tokens to buy food and enter the attractions.\n\nSo, let\u2019s pretend that a company is an amusement park and with the tokens, you can buy different services just as you do with carousels and hot dogs.\n\nNow, to make the analogy perfect, let\u2019s say that you can buy lots of tokens before the park is officially opened, or when it\u2019s just opened. If the park becomes popular, its tokens will be much more expensive. Like $10 for a hot dog. But a smart child who bought the tokens before the opening will still enjoy his meal for $1.\n\nThis is basically the idea behind issuing and buying tokens. But if in the amusement park you buy the tokens at the entrance, where do you get a cryptocurrency token?\n\nThe answer is ICO \u2013 Initial Coin Offering.\n\nToken \u2013 stock (Equity tokens)\n\nIn this case, ICO is completely equal to IPO. Usually, token-stocks are issued when a startup does not require a crypto-technology.\n\nIn this case, token holders will get dividend or fixed commission. They also will be able to take part is the company decisions. All this honor for supporting the project in the beginning of its life.\n\nToken \u2013 credit\n\nThis is a loan; a holder gives to a startup. It\u2019s another way to rise money. For example, you invest X to get X + 10 percent.\n\nToken \u2013 combo\n\nIf you are not completely confused, you will be now: sometimes a token can belong to more than one type. For example, tokens Sia and Digix are both tokens and stocks. And Steemit has all the three types of tokens (Steem, Steem Dollars (SBD) and Steem Power (a denomination of VESTS).\n\nHow do you trade tokens?\n\nThis part is pretty similar to coins. You have to register on an exchange for buying and selling tokens.\n\nThe transaction conditions can be really complicated: the contract can include multiple rules like \u201cyou can sell it only before a specified date\u201d or \u201cafter some date but only for a certain vendor.\u201d So, when investing in tokens, you should read the \u201csmall letters\u201d really thoroughly.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Check out our beginners guide on ICO Tokens to learn what is ICO token and is it an ICO token or coin.
