He did so not without controversy however as his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc was clearly angry he had lost his lead to the German through the team\u2019s pitstop strategy. Mercedes too suffered with their calls, Lewis Hamilton managing only fourth behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Valtteri Bottas was fifth for Mercedes and Alexander Albon sixth for Red Bull.\n\nSebastian Vettel wins Singapore GP, Hamilton finishes fourth \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nWith overtaking hard at Marina Bay the race was dictated by strategy and tyre wear as a series of safety cars interrupted the running and from which Vettel ultimately emerged on top. Ferrari were the quickest on track this weekend and having track position advantage, first with Leclerc and then with Vettel, did not relinquish it.\n\nFor the German the key moment came when he was pitted before Leclerc, who was leading, and with the undercut on fresh rubber took his place. Leclerc was not happy but Vettel closed out the win well under pressure without giving his teammate a chance to come at him.\n\nMercedes, looking for an alternative strategy for Hamilton, took a gamble by leaving their driver out long through the stops but it failed and he fell from second on track to fourth, from which he could not fight back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charles Leclerc (left) was aggrieved after finishing second.

It will come as a great relief to the German, who has not won a race since the Belgian Grand Prix over 12 months ago. He enjoys the challenge on the streets of Singapore and now with five wins, one more than Hamilton, is the race\u2019s most successful driver.\n\nThe victory also marks a potential turning point for Ferrari in proving their car can work successfully through the high-downforce circuits at which it has struggled all season.\n\nSpectacle of Singapore offers F1\u2019s best chance of attracting a new audience | Giles Richards Read more\n\nMercedes and Hamilton had come into the race expecting to be strong through the slow corners of Marina Bay. However the upgrades Ferrari brought to the nose, front wing, floor, diffuser and rear wing of their car came together this weekend remarkably well. They found the grip they had been lacking all season and with it the balance that allowed their drivers to attack the corners. Allied with their straightline speed advantage Ferrari had the superior package here.\n\nHamilton now leads Bottas by 65 points, with Verstappen and Leclerc tied on 31 points behind the Finn. Vettel is six points further back in fifth.\n\nThe leaders made it cleanly through turn one in grid order but Vettel harried Hamilton through the first lap. The British driver defended doggedly and held his second place as Leclerc immediately opened a gap in front.\n\nHaving held his place Hamilton moved up on Leclerc, with the three leaders within two seconds. By lap four Hamilton was within DRS range of Leclerc but there was no attack, with the pace painfully slow as drivers looked to minimise tyre wear on a heavy fuel load. Leclerc was controlling the pace and his rivals could only follow and wait.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nLeclerc finally blinked on lap 15, stepping up the pace and opening a gap. Hamilton followed him as they prepared for their stops, which were decisive. Hamilton was on his tail and as Leclerc pitted on lap 20 Mercedes opted to do the opposite to Ferrari. Hamilton stayed out while Leclerc emerged behind Vettel, who had pitted a lap earlier and undercut his teammate. Leclerc was aggrieved that as leader the stops had not gone in his favour.\n\nHamilton remained on track and was leading, while Mercedes were looking to Leclerc and Vettel hitting midfield traffic and losing time. They did so on lap 25 but Mercedes\u2019 gamble had failed. Hamilton\u2019s tyres had gone, he pitted on lap 26 and came out behind Verstappen, effectively in fourth.\n\nVettel was in control at the halfway stage, carving his way back to the front through the longer-running midfield cars and enjoying a five-second lead on his teammate. Three safety cars were subsequently called through incidents but Vettel maintained his cool and his lead after each one. He managed it to the flag as the order behind him remained, completing Ferrari\u2019s first one-two since Hungary in 2017.\n\nLando Norris was in seventh for McLaren, in front of the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly. Nico H\u00fclkenberg was in ninth for Renault and Antonio Giovinazzi 10th for Alfa Romeo.", "description": "Sebastian Vettel tooks victory in Singapore with Charles Leclerc second and Max Verstappen third", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7e449921b2213fe0e88a0d6434815547d9a169c/0_297_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03d68daabd0dee16b57e7a86fdbb2c56", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
