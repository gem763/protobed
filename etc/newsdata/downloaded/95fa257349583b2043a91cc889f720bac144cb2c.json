Her allies say no change is needed and have raised questions about who will pay if the move goes through, and have not ruled out a lawsuit to recover damages.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTaro Shirato and Hiroshi Yamada, members of Koike\u2019s political party in the metropolitan legislature, told a news conference Tuesday that moving the marathon would cost at least $34 billion yen, about $310 million.\n\nThe IOC said it\u2019s making the change, thinking first of athletes\u2019 safety from Tokyo\u2019s blistering summer heat.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Koike is one of Japan\u2019s most influential politicians and just a few years ago was viewed as a potential candidate for prime minister. And she\u2019s miffed about not being consulted.\n\n\u201cAlthough they (IOC) talk about so-called athletes first, this can only be perceived as IOC first,\u201d Shirato said through an interpreter.\n\n\u201cYou get the sense that no considerations have been made for the athletes,\u201d Shirato added, \u201cor the spectators who had already bought their tickets and who were looking forward to these events, or the potential spectators who will be cheering on the streets, and also to the people involved in the operation.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect the IOC to budge. It has inspectors in Tokyo this week looking at preparations with the Olympics opening in just under nine months on July 24.\n\nIOC member John Coates heads the team and is an ally to President Thomas Bach. He has said repeatedly the IOC does not intend to change its plans, and has told that to Koike.\n\nThe IOC fears worldwide television audiences might see a repeat of the recent world track and field championships in Doha, Qatar, where 28 of 68 starters failed to finish the women\u2019s marathon and 18 of 73 men failed to complete the course.\n\nThe races started at midnight in Doha with TV showing runners collapsing on the course. The scenes apparently shocked IOC President Thomas Bach.\n\nYamada acknowledged the heat posed a risk. He said Tokyo has proposed moving the start to 5 a.m., which is mid-summer sunrise in Tokyo. Last week city officials also floated the idea of a 3 a.m. start.\n\nEstimates suggest the temperature would be 27C (81F) at 5 a.m., and would be 25.4C (78F) in Sapporo for a 7 a.m. start. The starting temperature in Doha for the women\u2019s marathon was 32.7C (91F).\n\nYamada described the starting temperatures in Tokyo and Sapporo \u201con a par.\n\n\u201cWe do recognize and understand that the heat is a very important factor, but we do not believe that at this moment it represents an overly excessive risk.\u201d\n\nTokyo\u2019s soaring costs are also a major issue.\n\nA government audit report last year said Tokyo was spending about $25 billion to organize the Olympics, all of which is public money except for $5.6 billion from a privately financed operating budget.\n\nTokyo said in its bid in 2013 that the Olympic would cost $7.3 billion.\n\nYamada was asked who would pay for the increased costs.\n\n\u201cIn the event this is changed to Sapporo, then I believe the citizens of Tokyo will not be convinced they need to pay. What I can say is that the Tokyo Metropolitan Government should not be the one to pay.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Tokyo government might sue for damages, Yamada hedged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very difficult to respond to, but I believe in terms of discussions we need to clarify the legal context.\u201d\n\nTokyo\u2019s organizing committee president Toshiro Mori, a former Japanese prime minister, seems to have sided with the IOC and not with Koike. He suggested a few days ago that it was a done deal.\n\n\u201cCan we say no to the plan that the IOC and International Association of Athletics Federations already supported?\u201d Mori said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of good or bad, but we just have to accept it.\u201d\n\nHe also said cost was a major issue in moving the marathon.\n\n\u201cOur overall cost has become a humongous amount, so it would cause us pain if the cost is added to our bill,\u201d Mori said. \u201cSo I mentioned that to Mr. Coates, and he said he will look into it. We won\u2019t be able to pay if it\u2019s a significant damage to our finances. I have reminded him of that.\u201d\n\nAP", "description": "Tokyo city officials are in a public feud with the International Olympic Committee over IOC plans \u2014 made without consulting the city or local organizers \u2014 to move next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympic\u00a0marathons 800 kilometers (500 miles) north to Sapporo to avoid the capital\u2019s summer heat.
