But he dropped the Leicester man to the bench for the quarter-final win over Australia, against whom Jones said he had been \u201cspectacular\u201d after coming on during the second half.\n\nManu Tuilagi moves to outside centre while the pack is the same as against Australia, with the only other change being on the bench where Mark Wilson replaces Lewis Ludlam as back row cover.\n\nJonny May has recovered from a hamstring strain to start on the left wing, with Anthony Watson on the right and Elliot Daly at fullback.\n\nExplaining his flyhalf switch, Jones said: \u201cWhenever you play against New Zealand your work off the ball is going to be massively important. They like to move the ball around, they are very good on transition and George\u2019s work-rate off the ball has been absolutely exceptional.\u201d\n\nDropping Ford last week was seen as a way to stiffen the midfield to counter the physical threat of Australia centre Samu Kerevi. New Zealand midfield of Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue brings a different, more technical and mobile threat, which Jones is confident Ford can handle.\n\nHaving him and Farrell back in harness, as they were for most of the World Cup warm-ups and pool games, gives more attacking options, with the likelihood that Ford will give way for Slade in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe are up against a team with strengths all over the field,\u201d said Ford. \u201cWe are going to have to be alive in every moment of the game.\n\n\u201cBut where else would we rather be than playing in the semi-final of (a) World Cup against New Zealand?. If we can\u2019t embrace that and have the mindset to really attack that, then we shouldn\u2019t be in the position we\u2019re in. It\u2019s a pressurised game but we enjoy the pressure, we want to embrace it and I think we will do.\u201d\n\nJones said the experience many of his players have had of beating New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions would be beneficial.\n\n\u201cIt has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semi-final won\u2019t faze them.\u201d\n\nThere were 16 England players originally selected for that tour, where the series was drawn 1-1 after a win each and a draw in the final test, 13 of whom are in the current World Cup squad.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand are a great team... like any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d\n\nEngland have beaten New Zealand only once in their last 16 meetings, though the last game between them was a close one as the All Blacks came from 15-0 down to win 16-15 at Twickenham a year ago.\n\nThey last reached the final in 2007, losing to South Africa, while New Zealand are seeking a third successive title and have not lost a World Cup game since the 2007 quarter-finals.", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones has reverted to his twin playmaker approach by recalling George Ford at flyhalf and shifting Owen Farrell to centre for Saturday's World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, dropping Henry Slade to the bench.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444417933&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0IV", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
