Well then there you go,\u201d a bewildered Hasan retorted.\n\nMbete was joined by former ANC Members of Parliament Makhosi Khoza and Andrew Feinstein on the panel.\n\nThe former deputy president and ANC chairperson was asked by Hasan about South Africa being rated as the most unequal country in the world by the World Bank, to which she emphatically responded that the World Bank was \u201cnot God\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I wonder whether it\u2019s not an exaggeration. I really think we need to see both good and bad. The World Bank is not God.\u201d\n\nSouth Africans took to social media and referred to Mbete as \u201cembarrassing\u201d, with some questioning who sanctioned her to be on the show to begin with.\n\nFormer Speaker of national assembly, Baleka Mbete embarrassing herself in ALJAZEERA regarding Marikana.???? pic.twitter.com/rZUrCupeJD \u2014 Slotarnet Dube (@slotarnet) October 21, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIf dodging questions and lacking accountability was a person.\n\nWatch Baleka Mbete's interview on @AlJazeera_World \u2014 A??rica (@OnlyTed_) October 21, 2019\n\nWatch the full interview here:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Former National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete Mbete, who was being interviewed by Head to Head host Mehdi Hasan on the state of South Africa, seemed to deflect questions.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8579/e46df12ecdec42e3872fc11009389251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
