The new law is potentially subject to a confirmatory referendum as it makes changes to the Italian constitution.\n\n\"It's done! Promise kept\" a blog post from Five Star said after the vote in the lower house on Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, Five Star said the bill - which was supported by almost all parties - would save the country \u20ac1bn (\u00a3897m) over 10 years.\n\n\"It's the day we've been awaiting forever,\" Cabinet Secretary Riccardo Fraccaro said, according to Ansa.\n\n\"After almost 30 years of broken promises, the cut in MPs and senators is a reality. A new political season is starting, now the citizens are at the centre.\"\n\nThe news agency AGI (in Italian) calculated that as an MP costs \u20ac230,000 per year and a senator \u20ac249,600, the cuts in the lower house would save \u20ac52.9m annually and those in the senate \u20ac28.7m.\n\nThe new law should come into effect after the next elections which are due in 2023.\n\nA governing coalition between Five Star and the far-right League party broke down in August. Last month Five Star entered into a new coalition with the centre-left PD and made the new law a condition of its alliance.\n\nThe government's other main objective is to pass a budget to block a rise in VAT (sales tax), which is set to kick in on 1 January if the government fails to reach its debt-reduction target.", "description": "The ruling Five Star party says cutting the number of MPs and senators will save \u20ac1bn over 10 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/179A3/production/_109157669_057165675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
