The FTC\u2019s $5 billion civil penalty against Facebook for violations of an earlier FTC order is record-breaking and history-making. In addition, the settlement requires Facebook to implement changes to its privacy practices, its corporate structure, and the role of CEO Mark Zuckerberg that are seismic in scope. Simply put, when it comes to the business of consumer privacy, it\u2019s no longer business as usual at Facebook.\n\nWhy the FTC sued Facebook in 2012\n\nIn 2012, the FTC charged Facebook with eight separate privacy-related violations, including that the company made deceptive claims about consumers\u2019 ability to control the privacy of their personal data. One specific count alleged that Facebook allowed users to choose settings that supposedly limited access to their information just to \u201cfriends\u201d without adequate disclosures that another setting allowed that same information to be shared with the developers of apps those friends used. Put another way, suppose Consumer A restricted access to friends and designated Consumer B as a friend. If Consumer B used a particular app on Facebook \u2013 let\u2019s say a game \u2013 the game developer could access information about Consumer A, including data designated as private. That was all going on behind the scenes without a clear disclosure to Consumer A and in flagrant disregard of that person\u2019s privacy choices.\n\nTo settle that case, Facebook agreed to an order that, among other things: 1) prohibited Facebook from making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers\u2019 information, 2) prohibited Facebook from misrepresenting the extent to which it shares personal data, and 3) required Facebook to implement a reasonable privacy program.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Facebook flouted that order in multiple ways, and today\u2019s settlement holds them accountable for putting profits over their privacy promises.\n\nHow Facebook violated the 2012 FTC order and the FTC Act\n\nUnder the 2012 order, Facebook must honor consumers\u2019 privacy choices or face an order enforcement action, which can result in substantial civil penalties not legally available to the FTC in an initial lawsuit. The FTC alleges that since agreeing to that settlement, Facebook repeatedly misrepresented the extent to which users could control the privacy of their data.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to read the new complaint for details, but here are a few examples of how the FTC alleges Facebook violated the order. After agreeing to the 2012 settlement, Facebook launched services with feel-good names like \u201cPrivacy Shortcuts\u201d and \u201cPrivacy Checkup\u201d that claimed to help users manage their settings and limit who had access to their data. Concerned about their privacy, many consumers used those new tools to limit access just to friends.\n\nBut according to the FTC, even if people chose the most restrictive settings those tools allowed, Facebook made consumers\u2019 personal data accessible to companies that developed apps used by consumers\u2019 friends. To name just a few categories, that included the news and books they were reading, their relationship details, their religious and political views, their work history, their photos, and the videos they watched. Facebook did offer a setting to ensure users\u2019 privacy preferences would be honored, but it was hidden away in a place people were unlikely to look. And it wasn\u2019t directly accessible from the very tools the company touted as the way for consumers to \u201creview and edit the privacy of key pieces of information.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, at the 2014 F8 conference \u2013 a gathering of companies that build products and services around Facebook \u2013 Facebook announced that it was no longer allowing third-party developers to collect data about the friends of app users. However, Facebook was separately telling developers with existing apps on the platform that they could continue to collect friends\u2019 personal data for another year. And even after that period elapsed, Facebook continued to provide certain developers with access to friend data for years to come. The FTC says it took Facebook until at least June 2018 to stop providing access to this data to certain third-party apps.\n\nAnother way the FTC says Facebook violated the order was by failing to adequately assess and address privacy risks posed by third-party developers. Other than getting developers to click an \u201cI agree\u201d terms-and-conditions box when registering an app with the Facebook Platform, Facebook didn\u2019t screen developers or their apps before giving them access to massive amounts of data that users had designated as private. Of course, in the wrong hands, information like that can grease the wheels for identity thieves and fraudsters. One particularly troubling charge is that when Facebook learned that app developers were violating Facebook\u2019s terms, Facebook\u2019s enforcement action was often influenced by how much advertising money the app developer spent with Facebook. Just how much user data was improperly disclosed? Facebook\u2019s poor recordkeeping makes that difficult to determine.\n\nAccording to the complaint, another way Facebook misrepresented the extent to which users could control the privacy of their data related to a form of technology that raises particular concerns for many consumers: facial recognition. In an April 2018 update to its Data Policy, Facebook represented to consumers, \u201cFace recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.\u201d The complaint alleges that this statement was deceptive to tens of millions of users who have Facebook\u2019s facial recognition setting, \u201cTag Suggestions,\u201d because that setting was turned on by default and the updated Data Policy suggested that users would need to opt-in to having facial recognition enabled for their accounts.\n\nIn addition, the complaint charges Facebook with a new violation of the FTC Act. You know how Facebook asks users for their mobile phone number to help secure their accounts or reset their passwords? According to the complaint, Facebook didn\u2019t tell people it also used that phone number to serve them with ads.\n\nIt boils down to this. In the face of consumers\u2019 intent to limit information-sharing to a select few, Facebook ignored them and shared it broadly. Facebook did that despite its privacy promises, despite consumers\u2019 efforts to protect their privacy, and despite the terms of the 2012 order. Why? To further Facebook\u2019s financial interests.\n\nHow the new order will change Facebook\u2019s approach to consumer privacy\n\nThe $5 billion civil penalty is the largest ever imposed on a company anywhere for violating consumers\u2019 privacy. What\u2019s more, the penalty \u2013 which, by law, goes to the U.S. Treasury (not the FTC) \u2013 is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation. It\u2019s designed to make all companies \u2013 not just Facebook \u2013 sit up, take notice, and rethink their practices.\n\nCould the FTC have won a bigger civil penalty by going to court? Probably not. Judges tend to evaluate financial remedies in comparison with cases that have gone before it. That\u2019s why we think the financial settlement is in the public interest. It has the added benefit of establishing a new benchmark when the FTC challenges privacy violations in the future.\n\nThe order imposes additional requirements to address Facebook\u2019s illegal conduct. For example, Facebook must implement a stringent program to monitor third-party developers and terminate access to any developer that doesn\u2019t follow the rules. In addition, Facebook can\u2019t use for advertising purposes the phone numbers it obtained specifically for security. When it comes to facial recognition technology, the order requires Facebook to give clear notice of how it uses that information and it must get consumers\u2019 express consent before putting that data to a materially different use. Facebook also will have to encrypt passwords and can\u2019t ask people for their passwords to other services, and must report any privacy incident to the FTC within 30 days. On top of everything Facebook will have to do to protect consumers\u2019 privacy, it also has to implement a comprehensive data security program. Another important consideration: These new accountability provisions don\u2019t just apply to Facebook. They also apply to companies Facebook controls, like Instagram, WhatsApp, and other Facebook-owned affiliates that it shares consumers\u2019 information with between now and 2039.\n\nBut don\u2019t let a focus on the record-setting financial and conduct remedies distract from just how monumental a change the order imposes on Facebook\u2019s privacy ecosystem and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s job description. The order explains in detail a new system of independent control, multi-layer accountability, and personal responsibility over Facebook\u2019s practices, and substantially limits Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s unfettered say in privacy decisions. In fact, for the next 20 years, anytime Facebook makes a privacy decision, multiple independent watchdogs will be looking over its shoulder. You\u2019ll want to read the order in depth, but here are some highlights of ways that business is about to change at Facebook.\n\nWho will oversee privacy at Facebook? An Independent Privacy Committee. Facebook\u2019s Board of Directors will name a new subgroup that will serve as an Independent Privacy Committee. Facebook officers and employees \u2013 including Mr. Zuckerberg \u2013 are disqualified from membership. The Committee will be briefed about all material privacy risks and issues at the company, and has approval-and-removal authority over a new cadre of designated compliance officers and a third-party assessor that will not answer to Facebook. (More about them in a moment.)\n\nWho will carry out Facebook\u2019s day-to-day privacy program? Designated compliance officers. Expert compliance officers, who must be approved by the Independent Privacy Committee, will implement and maintain Facebook\u2019s privacy program. The compliance officers will be responsible for documenting every material privacy decision in detail. They\u2019ll provide that documentation quarterly to the third-party assessor and CEO Zuckerberg. They also will have to certify quarterly to the FTC that Facebook is complying fully with the privacy program. If that\u2019s not the case, the compliance officers will throw a flag that triggers even closer FTC scrutiny. In addition, the independent assessor will meet with the Independent Privacy Committee four times a year outside the presence of Facebook officers and employees. What if Facebook doesn\u2019t like what the compliance officers are doing? Tough. Only the Independent Privacy Committee can remove them from the job.\n\nWho else will be watching Facebook? A third-party assessor with broad monitoring powers. The assessor \u2013 who must be appointed with FTC approval \u2013 will provide an independent evaluation of Facebook\u2019s privacy practices every two years. The order mandates that the assessor must subject Facebook to substantial scrutiny and can\u2019t just take management\u2019s word for what\u2019s happening. In effect, the assessor must kick the tires, look under the hood, put it up on the lift, conduct diagnostics, and take it for a test drive. And again, Facebook will not be able to remove the assessor on its own.\n\nHow much of a role will CEO Mark Zuckerberg play in making final privacy decisions for the company? Substantially less, but he\u2019ll have much more on the line personally. Mr. Zuckerberg will get a copy of Facebook\u2019s written privacy program and quarterly reports of privacy decisions. But he does not control the Independent Privacy Committee, the designated compliance officers, or the third-party assessor. However, the order does impose a major requirement on him. Facebook\u2019s CEO must certify quarterly to the FTC that the company\u2019s privacy program complies with the order. A false certification could trigger civil or even criminal penalties.\n\nHow much access will the FTC have to Facebook\u2019s privacy decisions? An unprecedented amount. The order gives the FTC unparalleled access to Facebook\u2019s decision-making. Upon request, the FTC will get written documentation of every privacy decision Facebook makes and copies of the third-party assessor\u2019s reports. (Remember that the FTC has to approve who gets hired as the assessor.) The order also includes tools that slice through any red tape that could have hindered the FTC\u2019s ability to get records, conduct interviews, or take other steps to monitor Facebook\u2019s compliance.\n\nThe goal of the FTC\u2019s settlement is the creation of a new culture at Facebook where the company finally lives up to the privacy promises it has made to the millions of American consumers who use its platform.\n\n\n\n", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a paradigm shift looks like, you\u2019re witnessing one today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/images/press-releases/social-share/ftc_social_share_default_en_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-24"}
