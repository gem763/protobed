We have to win every time and it's the same feeling we have as players as well.\n\n\"A lot of focus quickly becomes negative. As players, we must try to keep all the negative things completely out. But what is the cause of our results is actually difficult to answer.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We can't close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky. And that is why in many ways we have helped make things much harder for ourselves.\"\n\nAsked about the impact of transfer speculation, he added: \"It doesn't matter at all.\n\n\"Everyone is professional and in all clubs there is talk of players going away. That side of the matter has no bearing on how we have performed so far this season.\n\n\"If I, as a football player, took all the rumors to me, I would float on a cloud. But I know that it can't all be true.\n\n\"It does not affect me what is written. But I do know that the bigger the name becomes international, the more there is written.\"", "description": "Christian Eriksen, linked with a Man Utd transfer in the summer, has spoken out on Tottenham's recent struggles", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536980.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Brighton-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
