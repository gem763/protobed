Kay Ivey said Monday that she feels fine and has a good prognosis after announcing last week that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing fine. I feel fine. I hope I look fine. \u2026 It was caught very, very early and it\u2019s a good prognosis, a high rate of success,\u201d Ivey told reporters after a speech at a south Alabama Army base.\n\nThe 74-year-old Republican governor announced last week that doctors found a malignant spot in her lung and that she will receive radiation treatments. Ivey has not disclosed her exact diagnosis or staging.\n\nIvey said Monday that she feels grateful the cancer was found early and for the support she has received from people across the state. She said doctors have assured her that a \u201cfull recovery is very, very possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s isolated. We\u2019ll zap it out with some radiation and be done with it,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cIf the doctors and I do my best, God will do the rest.\u201d\n\nThe governor underwent an outpatient procedure Friday at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which she said was to place markers to guide her radiation treatment.\n\nIvey talked briefly with reporters after speaking at the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker for a ceremony for the 2019 official White House Christmas ornament, which is in the image of the helicopter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alabama Gov.
