It's less barbaric \u2014 soothing, even. And at the very least, closer to how a human would actually open and close the Galaxy Fold:\n\nYou can scroll through CNET's YouTube video timeline below:\n\nThere's increased attention on Samsung's revised Galaxy Fold, as the first wave of devices in April started breaking far too easily in the hands of reviewers.", "description": "CNET demonstrates the tech equivalent of a brutal medieval torture designed to break the will of dissidents and heretics alike.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97911349e03f14315afbb4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
