(Getty) More\n\nCCTV demands apology from Morey\n\nSilver\u2019s latest statement coincides with a demand from CCTV that Morey apologize for his now-deleted tweet that read \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHong Kong is part of China's internal affairs which would tolerate no foreign meddling,\u201d the CCTV statement reads, while describing Hong Kong protestors as \u201crioters.\u201d \u201cMorey and Houston Rockets need to offer a sincere apology to the Chinese public. It would be unwise for any individual to underestimate 1.4 billion Chinese people's readiness to defend their national sovereignty and dignity.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s initial statement characterized Morey\u2019s tweet as \u201cregrettable\u201d and noted that his words don\u2019t \u201crepresent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d It drew intense backlash from both sides of the U.S. political aisle for the league\u2019s apparent stance in prioritizing its financial interests over human rights and Morey\u2019s ability to speak freely.\n\nMeanwhile, normally outspoken NBA figures like Steve Kerr and LeBron James have remained silent on the issue.\n\nSilver: NBA won\u2019t regulate speech\n\nSilver\u2019s formal statement Tuesday attempted to appease those concerns, clarifying that \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nIt can be read in full below:\n\nI recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear. Over the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China. At the same time, we recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world. But for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business. Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA -- and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game. In fact, one of the enduring strengths of the NBA is our diversity -- of views, backgrounds, ethnicities, genders and religions. Twenty-five percent of NBA players were born outside of the United States and our colleagues work in league offices around the world, including in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Taipei. With that diversity comes the belief that whatever our differences, we respect and value each other; and, what we have in common, including a belief in the power of sports to make a difference, remains our bedrock principle. It is inevitable that people around the world -- including from America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way. Basketball runs deep in the hearts and minds of our two peoples. At a time when divides between nations grow deeper and wider, we believe sports can be a unifying force that focuses on what we have in common as human beings rather than our differences.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Adam Silver continued to navigate the NBA's China conflict as state-run media pulled NBA games from its airwaves.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/35133aZIMjsTudAPAD0nUg--~B/aD0zNTYyO3c9NTM0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3ca27260-e9f1-11e9-bbf5-9ccd2c0e2174", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
