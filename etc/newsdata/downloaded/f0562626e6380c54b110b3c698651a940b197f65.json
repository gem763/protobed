The broiler contains heating elements above the patties to aid the cooking process, that is gas operated.\"\n\nBecause the meat is exposed to flame, the burger patties have the same look, texture, and flavour as other flame-grilled meat, Burger King had argued.\n\nBut the ARB was having none of it.\n\n\"The take-out of the commercial by the hypothetical reasonable consumer is clearly that the patties are 'braaied' or grilled above an open flame,\" it said.\n\n\"The fact that there is some contact with a flame, inside a gas broiler system, does not satisfy the expectations of open flame grilling as portrayed in the advertiser's commercial.\"\n\nOn that basisARB members have been ordered not to run the ad.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "South Africa's advertising regulator says Burger King makes it look as if it flame-grills its burgers, and that's not true.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9415/8df66a0ceb1d498e8dffa9989bf9aa5e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
