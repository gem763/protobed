Its main exports included coal, copper, rubber, plywood and tin, while it buys synthetic rubber, flat steel products, electronic circuits and yarn, among other goods, from South Korea.\n\nTalks on the bilateral trade and investment deal restarted after stalling in 2014 when Indonesian President Joko Widodo met South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Seoul in September 2018.\n\nThe revived talks \"only took three rounds of negotiations, e-mails, video conferences and the help of the ambassadors to reach the finish line\", Lukita said.\n\nBefore Wednesday's announcement, outstanding issues included calls from both sides for a further reduction of tariffs and Jakarta's demand that Seoul put an investment commitment into the automotive and smartphone sectors in the Southeast Asian country, according to Indonesia's trade ministry website.\n\nIndonesia has been seeking to expedite talks on free trade deals with many trading partners, hoping to attract more export-oriented investment by securing overseas market access.\n\nOver the past year, it has signed free trade deals with Australia, Chile and the European Free Trade Association.\n\nJakarta is currently leading ASEAN in the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations, which could become the world's biggest free trade bloc of 16 Asia Pacific economies.
