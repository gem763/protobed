They move him around. If you draw that card, you\u2019ve got to do a great job.\u201d\n\nYoung, 6-5 and 265 pounds, is the anchor of the Buckeyes\u2019 front seven and their most disruptive player.\n\nCan the 13th-ranked Badgers (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) contain the talented junior when they meet the fourth-ranked Buckeyes (7-0, 4-0) when the teams meet at 11 a.m. Saturday in Columbus?\n\nYoung is No. 1 nationally in sacks (9\u00bd) and sack yardage (minus-70 yards). His average of 1.36 sacks per game is the No. 1 mark in the country. He had a sack in the first quarter of the Buckeyes\u2019 52-3 victory over Northwestern to extend his sack streak to nine consecutive games.\n\nOhio State defensive end Chase Young leads the nation in quarterback sacks this season with 9 1/2.

Since the start of last season, Young leads the nation in sacks with 20 in a total of 21 games.\n\n\u201cHe is obviously really talented and plays with great effort,\u201d UW coach Paul Chryst said. \u201cHe\u2019s got good size, length \u2026 explosive. And I think like any good player, he has that confidence. He has done it.\u201d\n\nOver and over.\n\nYoung can line up at right end or left end. He is also explosive enough to move inside in obvious passing situations if the Ohio State defensive staff thinks it can surprise the opponent.\n\nHe has enough power to walk a lineman into the backfield and is quick enough to use a speed rush to the outside or cut inside if the tackle cheats too far to the outside.\n\nUW left tackle Cole Van Lanen expects to see Young across the line of scrimmage Saturday.\n\n\u201cI see what you guys see,\u201d Van Lanen said. \u201cI think he is a tremendous athlete, a true prototype edge rusher. He is very quick off the edge. He\u2019s got a good handful of moves he can use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge but I\u2019m excited to take on the challenge and show the type of player I am, too.\u201d\n\nYoung has 23 total tackles, tied for third-highest on the team. Almost half (10 \u00bd) have been for loss.\n\nYoung recently spoke bluntly about his goals for the 2019 Buckeyes.\n\n\u201cI feel like just my whole time here, I\u2019ve never been to the playoffs,\u201d Young told Cleveland.com. \u201cI feel like every year, we had a fluke loss.\u201d\n\nThe loss that kept the Buckeyes out of the College Football Playoff in 2017 was a 55-24 decision at Iowa. Ohio State settled for the Cotton Bowl and a date with No. 8 USC. The Buckeyes prevailed, 24-7, to finish 12-2.\n\nThe loss that kept the Buckeyes out of the playoffs last season was a 49-20 decision at Purdue. Ohio State settled for the Rose Bowl and a date with No. 9 Washington. The Buckeyes prevailed, 28-23, to finish 13-1.\n\nThe Buckeyes finished a combined 25-3 in those two seasons and Young wants more this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just real focused,\u201d he told Cleveland.com. \u201cI tell them every day, it\u2019s only one game, and one game can make us not get where we want to be. So I try to stay focused and stay locked in. I\u2019ll laugh when the job is done.\u201d", "description": "OSU defensive end Chase Young has 9 1/2 sacks this season and at least one sack in his last nine games.
