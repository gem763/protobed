This is absolutely not the case.\n\n\"All questions regarding ISX\u2019s shareholders should be directed to those shareholders.\u201d\n\niSignthis had previously said in response to questions about Red 5 that it is \"not privy to the ownership\" of shareholders other than individuals.\n\nThe BVI company appeared on the iSignthis share register in September last year with 130 million shares. It sold 17.5 million shares in February this year. Red 5 holds performance rights on behalf of a number of early staff.\n\nAndrew Karantzis is the company's chief of sales and was named in Monday's announcement as one of eight \"angel\" investors who had backed the business before it floated.\n\nJohn Karantzis previously declined to respond directly when The Australian Financial Review asked him whether Andrew Karantzis had an interest in Red 5. He said \"no related parties\" held shares.\n\nHowever, a connection was inferred because Ms Naumova, who signed Red 5's stock exchange disclosures, had appeared in social pages photographs at an event with Andrew Karantzis. She also told a journalist from The Daily Mail in 2018 that she resides in Cyprus and her husband, Andrew, was a company director.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niSignthis has maintained that its disclosures are adequate and no Red 5 investors or beneficiaries qualify as \"related parties\" as defined by the Corporations Act.\n\nHowever, issues could arise depending on the nature of associations between the entities, such as determining whether there is sufficient liquidity in the stock, used to calculate the free float, and considered by index providers for index inclusion.\n\nThe ASX was unable to comment at this time, because it is one of the issues being looked at in the broader iSignthis enquiry, a spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\n'Opaque' ownership denied\n\niSignthis has strongly rejected claims that its ownership structure is \"opaque\".\n\nHowever, it may have had to disclose further details of its ownership to European financial authorities as part of its Electronic Money Institution application.\n\nA document produced by Deloitte to assist clients in applying for a licence with Cypriot authorities advised that legal or natural persons with a holding of more than 10 per cent are required to complete a questionnaire.\n\niSignthis has an office in Cyprus and its subsidiary iSignthis eMoney Ltd is authorised by the Central Bank of Cyprus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShares in iSignthis remain suspended while the ASX and ASIC seek responses to several issues relating to the company.\n\niSignthis said on Monday the suspension gave it an opportunity to \"clear up rumour and innuendo\" surrounding the business, and attributed the queries to share price volatility.\n\nLast month, iSignthis declined to explain the nature of alerts set off at Danish bank KAB last year, after a joint investigation by The Australian Financial Review and Danish business publication B\u00f8rsen revealed that KAB received 26 alerts relating to foreign transfers in and out of the account of iSignthis eMoney.\n\niSignthis assured the market it \"adheres [to] or exceeds\" its regulatory requirements.\n\nThe alerts related to unusually large foreign transfers and were triggered between June 14 and July 23, 2018; 10 of 14 alerts in June related to payments into the iSignthis subsidiary account and 10 of 11 alerts in July related to payments out of the account.", "description": "iSignthis says it cannot disclose further details about Red 5 Solutions, its second-largest shareholder, after revealing the CEO's brother has an interest in Red 5.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3631%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1135%2C$y_323/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/91ec94359d0d76f3701e289c3e50c18d1bd9c540", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
