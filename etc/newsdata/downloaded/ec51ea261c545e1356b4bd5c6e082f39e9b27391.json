He was sweating.\u201d\n\nWood responded: \u201cIt was 100 degrees outside, of course I was sweating!\n\n\u201cI\u2019d thought about it before, and we\u2019d been going on almost two years now being together\u2026 it was just time when we had a vacation planned that I knew that was going to completely take her off guard. It was a cool place, it was something that I knew we could get it filmed and I could have the moment captured.\n\n\u201cAs far as nerves, I have a really good thing to be able to shut down my mind when it comes down to cornering or things like that, so I put myself in that mode. I just got in there and I think just asked her as we were just taking pictures and the lady was posing us and I said, \u2018So, are you ready to hyphenate that name? Do you want to be Calderwood-Wood?\u2019 and she lost her (expletive) and started crying for the next 30 minutes. But, I just got down and did it.\u201d\n\nWhile Wood and Calderwood planning for a happy future together, they are also planning a similarly happy time for \u201cJoJo\u201d inside the octagon, with the Scot standing on the verge of a shot at the UFC women\u2019s flyweight title.\n\n\u201cI see myself top five \u2013 right now I\u2019m No. 3,\u201d she said. \u201cSo right now I\u2019m in a good position. Maybe one more fight before the title, or I could potentially just sneak in there, depending (on what happens).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if Valentina wants one more fight before the end of the year, and I\u2019m just being ready. There\u2019s another two flyweight fights coming up, so (I\u2019m) just in the gym staying ready, and ready for any opportunity that comes my way.\u201d\n\nSome fighters would want to ensure they get a full fight camp ahead of their shot at UFC gold, but Calderwood knows that you have to take your chance when it comes, so she\u2019s making sure she\u2019s in tip-top shape for whenever that phone rings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years and I\u2019m not here to sit back and turn down any opportunity coming my way,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the moment and the best I\u2019ve been in my career. I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m physically in the best shape of my career and I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nThe reason for that attitude is partly because of the fact that the UFC had sounded her out for a potential short-notice title shot after her win over Andrea Lee in Abu Dhabi, as Wood explained.\n\n\u201cBy the time we got back to our connecting flight some people from the UFC had already mentioned to us about it: \u2018There\u2019s a potential matchup in three weeks for the title. Potentially, do you want it?'\u201d he said. \u201cShe, coming off a broken nose and everything, said yes immediately. The one thing with the UFC, you certainly don\u2019t want to turn down title fights. Three weeks, banged up, she said yes to it. It didn\u2019t pan out, but she\u2019s ready whatever.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s that willingness to jump at an opportunity when it arises that Wood says could play in Calderwood\u2019s favor when the time comes to sign reigning flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko to her next title defense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what happens to people who turn down a title shot before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have that big of an opportunity, you don\u2019t say no, no matter what. If her leg was hanging off, maybe we\u2019d think about maybe we\u2019re not gonna do that. It\u2019s just in this sport, you never know.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to leapfrog a couple of people. If you say no you might get kicked down the line and wait four or five fights and it never comes up. So you have to take the opportunity whether it\u2019s good, bad or indifferent. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen over the years is the UFC is always appreciative of is people who are willing to step up and fight whenever they\u2019re called.\u201d", "description": "Joanne Calderwood and coach John Wood chat about their recent engagement and their hopes for a shot at the UFC women's flyweight title.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-jojo-john.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
