His latest book is novel Chasing Painted Horses, which follows four young friends from an Ontario reserve called Otter Lake.\n\nTaylor stopped by The Next Chapter to discuss two novels \u2014 S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders and Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water \u2014 that he would take on a desert island.\n\n\"For every book I read, there are a thousand more I have to read. I do not have the luxury of spare time to go back and reread the books I've read and loved.\"\n\n\"However, if I were on a desert island and I only had one or two books to read, it would come down to Green Grass Running Water by Thomas King \u2014 because I remember reading it and being blown away by the universe and or universes he creates within that book \u2014 and also S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders, the book that that impressed me most as a teenager and left me surprised and flabbergasted, learning only years later, that it was written by a teenage girl.\"\n\nDrew Hayden Taylor's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Ojibway playwright, author and journalist loves S.E.
