He was penalised with a 10-second-stop-and-go punishment, finishing 13th, a lap behind his team-mate.\n\n\u201cThis moment must be so dark for Vettel,\u201d said Rosberg. \u201cHis team-mate just became an absolute Ferrari legend, taking his number one status in the team.\n\n\u201cIt is unexplainable for me. He is a four-time world champion, he is one of the best guys out there and to make a mistake like that, on your own, just spinning the car, is so strange.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Ferrari are standing by their \u00a336million-a-year driver, with chief executive Louis Camilleri, who was among the team\u2019s bigwigs in Monza to witness Vettel\u2019s latest capitulation, insisting he will bounce back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that people are trying to write off Seb,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing driver and I have every confidence that Seb\u2019s going to come back.\u201d\n\nBut privately, the Scuderia will be alarmed. Vettel is desperately out of form, out of confidence, and might well be considering his future.\n\nHis Ferrari contract expires at the end of next season, but the emergence of Leclerc may see him depart before then.\n\nVettel has not been able to add to his 52 victories \u2013 only Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton have won more times in Formula One \u2013 in more than a year.\n\nVettel should have triumphed at June\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix, only to run off the road under pressure from Hamilton. He has been out-qualified by Leclerc at the following seven rounds.\n\nDuring the same period, Leclerc has also scored three poles to Vettel\u2019s zero, won twice, and accumulated 41 more points than his more experienced team-mate.\n\nLeclerc saw off Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, in the sister Mercedes, to secure his second win in as many races on Sunday.\n\nLeclerc was aggressive in his defence of first position, with Hamilton insisting he will speak to the Ferrari driver about his conduct.\n\nBut the five-time world champion, who holds a 63-point title lead with seven races left, says he does not harbour any ill feeling towards the sport\u2019s rising star.\n\n\u201cThere are zero issues between us,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cCharles is one of the most respectful drivers.\n\n\u201cThis was the first time that I have gone wheel-to-wheel with him and with a new driver you learn how they approach different scenarios. Maybe next time I will position my car differently, and I will do a better job.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Former world champion Nico Rosberg believes Sebastian Vettel is in a dark place after claiming the German has lost his number one status at Ferrari to Charles Leclerc.
