The three-story mansion, built with cascading waterfalls, vaulted ceilings and its own indoor golf simulator, hit the market on Sunday slightly less than the former NBA legend paid for it 12 years ago, according to property records.\n\n\n\nMore: Newly Built Modernist Abode in Los Angeles Hitting Market for $14.5M\n\nMr. Jordan, 56, a billionaire businessman and majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets, has owned the Park City property for over a decade. An Illinois-based entity managed by Mr. Jordan bought the four-acre estate in 2007 for $7.9 million, records show\u2014$400,000 less than what he\u2019s selling it for today.\n\n\n\nMr. Jordan could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 2006, the hillside mansion has sweeping mountain views due to floor-to-ceiling glass and a large outdoor terrace with a halfmoon infinity pool.\n\n\n\nWhile multi-colored stone cladding gives the exterior a Rocky Mountain vibe, the mansion is fully contemporary on the inside.\n\n\n\nA vast open floor plan and vaulted double-height ceilings span much of the home\u2019s middle level, including a sun-drenched kitchen and living room. The great room also features a towering sculptural fireplace and soaring windows overlooking the landscape, according to images from the listing with The Agency Park City. A spokeswoman for the agents said the brokerage could not comment on the listing.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Sotheby\u2019s to Offer Francis Bacon\u2019s \u2018Pope\u2019 on Behalf of Brooklyn Museum\n\nThere are five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, in total, as well as a circular outdoor kitchen with its own dramatic fireplace.\n\n\n\nThe former basketball star, who played 13 seasons for the Chicago Bulls in the 1980s and \u201990s, will also throw in the home\u2019s furnishings by separate agreement, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nAt a little over 9,500 square feet, the Park City house is puny compared to the palatial Chicago-area megamansion Mr. Jordan has been trying to unload for the past seven years, according to The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the listing.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117272?size=1.725067385444744&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
