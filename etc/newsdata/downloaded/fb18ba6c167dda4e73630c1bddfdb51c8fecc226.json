It would then be voted on on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson had previously said he would wait for confirmation from the EU27 of the Brexit delay he reluctantly requested on Saturday, after MPs refused to fast-track his deal through parliament in time for the 31 October deadline.\n\nIn a BBC/Sky interview, Johnson said: \u201cThe way to get Brexit done is, I think to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuinely want more time... they can have it but they have to agree to a general election on December 12th.\u201d", "description": "Prime minister expected to table motion for general election on Monday", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/607fb4edde5d3001b0f68cf9242ffdf4afef63eb/0_201_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1806dff3d2c51b47e8f3b1d3a5439cc2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
