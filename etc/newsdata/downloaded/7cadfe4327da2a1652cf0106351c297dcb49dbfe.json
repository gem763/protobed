He\u2019s had to ration both.\n\nInterested in General Motors? Add General Motors as an interest to stay up to date on the latest General Motors news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe General Motors worker, on the picket lines for over a month, now plans the whole week\u2019s dinners ahead of time, strategizing leftovers for the meals his three children will have. They like pizza and french fries, but most nights he sticks with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or Ramen noodles, for himself.\n\nAs the GM nationwide strike grinds toward its fifth week, United Auto Workers are feeling the strain in what has become the longest walkout the company has faced in half a century.\n\nBehind Howell\u2019s picket line in Flint, Michigan -- where General Motors was born -- and across the country, the workers' unyielding stance hides the stress that the strike has put on many pocketbooks.\n\n\"I have to keep going, I gotta pay my bills, I gotta eat,\" he told ABC News. \"My savings are almost spent; I\u2019ve had to skim way down, and dig way into it. \u2026 I don\u2019t have a lot longer to wait. I just don\u2019t.\"\n\nOn a drive around the perimeter of the huge GM plant in Flint, striking workers stand like sentries at every gate, every hour of every day.\n\n\"That truck's in my blood,\" Howell told ABC News. \"I take pride in General Motors. I put my all into what I do \u2026 it\u2019s part of our identity,\" he said. \"And now it\u2019s like \u2026 they forgot about us. The ones that stood them up when they fell down. And we just want a thank you.\"\n\nBill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nHowell has been a temporary worker for nearly four years -- and at the crux of what the prolonged picket line stands for. He is a third-generation GM worker: a point of deep pride.\n\nHonking horns blare up and down Bristol Road to show solidarity with the UAW.\n\nOutside, strikers sit on lawn chairs and under tents, with coolers full of bottled water. Local community members bring them brown-bag snacks. They\u2019ve been in it for the long haul, but even that\u2019s being tested now.\n\n\"It\u2019s scary as hell,\" Howell said. He honks his own horn, raising his voice above it. \"There is no room to say no, no room to negotiate, no room to bargain.\"\n\n\"People have spent decade after decade after decade doing this repetitive work, and it puts a beating on your body,\" he continued. \"And you shouldn\u2019t worry about how you\u2019re going to pay for it, because the reason your body is getting beat up is the work you\u2019re doing for this company that\u2019s making billions off your back.\n\n\"We just want a piece of the pie that we helped create.\"\n\nOn day 28 of the strike, as workers took to the streets for another \"Solidarity Sunday\" demonstration, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes thanked members for \"holding the line.\"\n\n\"As you know, our issues our just,\" he said.\n\nChief among those issues is securing seniority, health care and higher wages for temp workers.\n\nABC News\n\nTalks between GM and the UAW union continued through the weekend even amid concerns negotiations have stagnated. Late Friday, the UAW sent yet another counterproposal to the company after several sharp exchanges of words.\n\nHarsh missives were volleyed back and forth throughout the fourth week of the strike -- with both sides digging in.\n\n\"At every step of the way, GM has attempted to undermine the ongoing, good-faith efforts the UAW has made to end this strike,\" the UAW said in an official statement Friday. \"The company\u2019s strategy from day one has been to play games at the expense of workers.\"\n\nGerald Johnson, GM\u2019s executive vice president of manufacturing, wrote Friday that they had advised the union: \"It\u2019s critical that we get back to producing quality vehicles for our customers.\"\n\nA spokesperson for General Motors said the two sides continue to make progress, but a source close to the UAW told ABC News that the strategy seems to be to \"literally starve members off the picket line as a way to leverage unfair concessions.\"\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing negotiations told ABC News on Sunday that the two sides are \"still pretty far apart\" from reaching a deal, \"unless a miracle happens.\"\n\nIn a sign of slight relief for workers like Howell, the union announced it would raise strike pay from $250 to $275 per week late Saturday.\n\n\"Every little bit more helps,\" Howell said. \"Two-fifty has barely been enough to put gas in the car and groceries on the table.\"\n\nWorkers are also now allowed to look for part-time work, provided it does not interfere with their picket duties, of course. Howell\u2019s frustration with the company has pushed him to start looking for other work, full-stop.\n\n\"This company has so little loyalty,\" he said. \"It doesn\u2019t feel like the same GM I grew up knowing. I might have to walk away \u2026 don\u2019t want to, but I might have to,\" he said.\n\nBill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nHowell fears the strike\u2019s stigma might make him less hireable by another company.\n\n\"None of us are expecting to be invited into another company with open arms,\" he said. \"But I just want to work. That\u2019s all I want. And I can\u2019t afford to go back to school right now.\"\n\nWhen asked what he wants, Howell said he still hopes to hear an apology from General Motors.\n\n\"We were wrong. And we\u2019re sorry. We were wrong. You guys are right,\" Howell said of what he wants to hear. \"We understand that we owed you better than we gave you. We want to get back to work.\"\n\n\"I feel like I have a voice now. And I don't want that to go away, because I should have always.\"", "description": "As the GM strike grinds towards a fifth week in what is now the longest in half a century, UAW workers feel the strain and doubt negotiation progress", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/gm-strike-mo_hpMain_20191014-010402_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
