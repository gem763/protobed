FB 2.01% and Alphabet Inc. GOOG 2.54% \u2019s Google unit starting next week, according to people familiar with the matter, putting added pressure on tech giants already under federal scrutiny.\n\nThe Google probe is expected to be announced at a news conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, with a bipartisan group of about three dozen state attorneys general joining the effort, the people said.\n\nThe investigation will be led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, the people said. The attorneys general will examine the impact of Google on digital advertising markets, this person said, as well as potential harms to consumers from their information and ad choices being concentrated in one company.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you support a joint antitrust investigation of major tech firms? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nSeparately, an overlapping bipartisan group of attorneys general led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is organizing a probe into social media company Facebook, according to these people.\n\n\u201cWe continue to engage in bipartisan conversations about the unchecked power of large tech companies,\u201d Ms. James said in a statement to the The Wall Street Journal when asked for comment on the probe. \u201cThe attorneys general involved have concerns over the control of personal data by large tech companies and will hold them accountable for anticompetitive practices that endanger privacy and consumer data.\u201d\n\nFacebook recently agreed to shell out $5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and account settings to lure users into sharing personal information, and remains under federal scrutiny for issues including whether it acquired companies such as Instagram to stave off competition.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton will lead the investigation into Google.

So we need to do something about that.\u201d\n\nFor now, it appears unlikely the state and federal investigations will be formally coordinated. But the federal enforcers have been meeting with state attorneys general, and closer cooperation could develop as the probes move forward.\n\n\u201cThe FTC values our cooperative relationship with the AGs and routinely coordinates on tech and antitrust issues,\u201d a spokeswoman for the FTC said.\n\nThe Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe participation of so many attorneys general of both parties in the probe is potentially worrisome for the big tech companies. About 20 attorneys general were involved in the federal government\u2019s last major tech antitrust case, against Microsoft Corp. , two decades ago.\n\nMicrosoft eventually agreed to an array of conditions in that case, including making the Windows platform more accessible to third-party software developers.\n\nAt a minimum, the attorneys general\u2019s involvement this time is sure to add complexity and cost for the companies. For instance, the state attorneys are often able to extract large fines in antitrust cases, in circumstances where federal enforcers can\u2019t.\n\nThe involvement of the attorneys general also lends a bipartisan gravitas to the antitrust probes, making it harder for the companies to attack them as politically motivated.\n\nAt the same time, the state attorneys will face the challenge of coordinating complex investigations among so many offices. Some attorney general offices, particularly in smaller states, also lack the personnel and resources to throw into the demanding job.\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nWrite to John D.
