(AP) \u2014 Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres, Awkwafina and more stars overcame a dysfunctional teleprompter to toast one another and their charities at a women\u2019s luncheon Friday in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine but Jen (Aniston) is freaking it back there,\u201d DeGeneres said as harried staff struggled to fix the broken screens that just a few minutes earlier had Awkwafina nervously winging it (\u201cI can do a little tech support,\u201d she offered) before calling someone to just bring up her phone so she could read her speech manually.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing like a few comedians to handle technological issues with grace and humor. Both had the crowd in stiches despite the minor chaos happening around them.\n\nThe 11th annual Variety Power of Women luncheon honoring Aniston, Awkwafina, Chaka Khan, Mariah Carey, Brie Larson and Disney Television Studios chairman Dana Walden boasted a roster of A-list guests and presenters from DeGeneres, to Natalie Portman and Ryan Murphy who charmed and inspired the well-heeled crowd of entertainers and industry insiders with speeches about their charitable causes and their commitment to empowering women in the industry.\n\nAniston was introduced by DeGeneres, who kept things light and didn\u2019t mention the recent social media uproar around her friendship with George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cWhat an honor it is for Jen Aniston to receive this from me,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cIn a world where people are angry and mean she is one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nAniston wiped tears away as she recalled meeting a young girl fighting cancer at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\n\u201cEvery child deserves to know that they are seen and heard,\u201d she said, remembering a time when an adult told her, at 11, that she didn\u2019t have anything interesting to say. She said she carried that sentence with her into adulthood and often finds herself feeling like that 11-year-old at dinners.\n\n\u201cThe Morning Show\u201d star said her \u201cFriends\u201d mom Marlo Thomas introduced her to the hospital, which she has been working with for 25 years. And she said the last two years in the industry, following the rise of #MeToo, has made her think a lot about the messages \u201cwe send\u201d young kids and girls.\n\n\u201cThe things we say and do can either build them up or tear them down and make them feel like maybe their voices don\u2019t matter,\u201d Aniston said.\n\nShe admitted that she never, \u201cActually thought about myself as powerful. Strong, yes, but not powerful\u2026It\u2019s a distinction I\u2019ve actually been thinking about a lot lately because that word \u2018power\u2019 and its counterpart, \u2018abuse of power,\u2019 keeps coming up in light of what is happening in our country and in our industry \u2014 a rebalancing of the scales.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t the only to touch on cancer. Ryan Murphy, who credited Walden with giving him a chance in television when no one else would, also thanked the Disney executive for being there when he found out his 18-month-old son had a tumor a few years ago. Walden has worked with the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center since her own mother was diagnosed a decade ago.\n\nJustice and empowerment were also on the minds of Carey, who spoke about how her own experiences at a performing arts camp helped inspire her to begin Camp Mariah 25 years ago, and Larson, who ceded part of her speech to Equal Justice Initiative operations director Eva Ansley, the woman she plays in the upcoming movie \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d about the advocacy organization\u2019s founding.\n\nThe event, which was put on with the help of presenters like Lifetime and sponsors like Audi, was tamer than in years past when celebrities used their platforms to talk about everything from politics and the patriarchy to Harvey Weinstein.\n\nBut Carey managed to thrown in a little spice of her own in remembering how she had to learn how to gain control over her career over the men who wanted to dictate what she wore and who she worked with when she was just starting out.\n\n\u201cI want to thank each woman in this room and all the women who have come forward with their truths, their harrowing experiences, and above all their triumphs over the misogynistic society of corporate (expletives) that we deal with every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr", "description": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
