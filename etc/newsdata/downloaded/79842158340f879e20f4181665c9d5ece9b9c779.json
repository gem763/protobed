We want to know: How much of my earnings should I set aside? What\u2019s the magic number? 3%? 5%? 10%? More?\n\nWhat your financial adviser won\u2019t tell you:\n\nUnfortunately, the retirement industry has spent decades largely avoiding the magic-number question. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic number for everyone,\u201d some say. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d say others. And then they offer, sometimes for a fee and sometimes for \u201cfree,\u201d to take our money and invest it for us \u2014 often without telling us whether it\u2019ll be enough when the time comes.\n\nWhy will no one give us a magic number? They don\u2019t want to be legally responsible when the number turns out to be too low, which, for some of us \u2014 especially those whose pay is low or whose investments are poor or who live long and need a nursing home for years \u2014 it will. The legal jitters are understandable, but they leave us in the dark about how much to save.\n\nDon\u2019t give up hope. There\u2019s research that can help \u2014 from institutions that don\u2019t have a conflict of interest because they don\u2019t invest or give advice. My favorite is the Employee Benefits Research Institute in Washington, D.C. EBRI, as it\u2019s called, gathered anonymous information on tens of millions of people and how they actually save. It won\u2019t tell people what to do, but from its research there\u2019s a pretty useful rule of thumb for young people: Count on your fingers and \u2026\n\nSave 10% \u2014 now\n\nBetween you and your employer, set aside at least 10% of your paycheck. If your employer contributes 3%, then your share is at least 7%. If the company kicks in 5%, then you save at least 5%. If your employer does nothing, set aside at least 10% of each paycheck on your own.\n\nOf course, there will be times when you\u2019re between jobs or you need your money for a pre-retirement-age emergency. In those cases, you can put your money in a Roth individual retirement account (IRA) account. That way, you can take your contributions out without penalty. (There are also Roth 401(k) accounts, though they have more complicated withdrawal rules.) Don\u2019t let the fact that you might need money someday keep you from saving for retirement now.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly OK to consult a financial adviser and get more personalized recommendations, but if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to \u2014 or while you\u2019re waiting to \u201cget around to it\u201d \u2014 set aside enough so that, together with your employer match, you\u2019re putting aside at least 10%.\n\nRead: Where\u2019s the best place for me to retire?\n\nAmerica\u2019s No. 1 fear: golden years minus the gold\n\nPeople are living longer. That\u2019s both good news and bad: We hear about baby boomers moving into posh \u201cactive adult\u201d communities, but we also hear about disabled and bedridden elderly requiring years\u2019 worth of health aides and the constant help of their children. Either way, longer lives seem expensive.\n\nAnd our capacity to lay the groundwork for retirement can feel pinched from all directions. Life can be expensive even in our earning years, with college tuition, housing and medical costs in the stratosphere. Student loans and credit-card debt intrude. Social Security, we\u2019re told, is at risk. Lifetime pensions are, for most, a thing of the mythical past. All that most of us feel we can count on is a retirement account that\u2019s at the mercy of the markets and, we suspect, doesn\u2019t have enough in it. Many, of course, don\u2019t even have that.\n\nA contribution rate of 10% starting in your mid-20s cuts the risk of running out of money in retirement to about 30%\n\nExperts often tell us how complicated this is to figure out \u2014 and why we should hire them to do it for us. And it is easy to make it complicated: We can try to decide \u2014 now, decades before we\u2019re ready to even think about retiring \u2014 what our future earnings will be and how long we\u2019ll work, what lifestyle we\u2019d prefer in retirement, how much health care will cost decades down the road, how long we\u2019ll live after retirement (with a margin for error, of course), how our money should be invested and what our investment returns will be (with, again, a margin for error). Not complicated enough? Add whether or not we\u2019ll need funds at hand to support children or parents or other family members.\n\nThe result is confusion. Some people get financial advice. Others turn to online retirement calculators. Many, sadly, do nothing at all, falling back on a vow of resignation: \u201cI\u2019ll just keep working.\u201d (Spoiler: Almost no one who says they\u2019ll work until they die ends up doing so.) For still others, it means saving too little.\n\nModeling for millennials\n\nHow can EBRI\u2019s model help? It estimates the risk of running out of money after retirement by taking into account many more factors than the usual online calculator: contributions, market changes, Social Security benefits and salary growth, as well as a range of health outcomes and longevity prospects. It can then estimate the risk that \u2014 for particular savings rates and income levels \u2014 a person\u2019s expenses in retirement will overwhelm their savings plus Social Security benefits.\n\nFor this article, EBRI provided projections for today\u2019s 25-year-olds at multiple income levels; we\u2019ll interpolate the results to reflect the median income of today\u2019s 25-year-olds, which is $30,000. (The projections assume that people will earn more as they get older.)\n\nWe then applied EBRI\u2019s projections to three millennials. Their names have been changed, but they are all in their mid-20s. We\u2019ll assume they\u2019re average earners:\n\nPhillip, working in a startup, contributes 3% of pay to a retirement account. His employer contributes nothing.\n\nIda, an office worker, contributes 3%, which her employer matches, for a total of 6%.\n\nJohn, working for a financial firm, contributes 8%. His employer contributes 4%, for a total of 12%.\n\nAre they contributing enough, too much or too little? Here\u2019s how, based on EBRI\u2019s model, our millennials and their different savings practices would end up at retirement:\n\nIf Phillip, from a current salary of $30,000, continues to contribute just 3%, he has a 56% chance of running through both his retirement savings and Social Security in his lifetime. (If he were earning $40,000 now, the odds improve, but his chance of running out of money still exceeds 40%.) Clearly, then, 3% isn\u2019t enough.\n\nIda, being a woman, will likely live longer, so her 6% total contribution will have to last longer, and the probability that neither it nor Social Security will be enough is 47%. Sounds like 6% is too low, as well.\n\nJohn, contributing 12% of pay, has less than one chance in four (23%) of running out of money.\n\nOverall, the EBRI simulation model suggests that, in the income ranges of most millennials, a contribution rate of 10% starting in a worker\u2019s mid-20s cuts the risk of running out of money in retirement to about 30%, less than one chance in three. Contributing more than 10% when you can will give you a better cushion.\n\nOf course, everyone\u2019s situation is and will be different, so 10% is a guideline, not a guarantee. (Furthermore, if you start later in life, 10% won\u2019t be nearly enough.)\n\nDigital piggy banks\n\nBy now you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cThis is easier said than done.\u201d And you\u2019re right. Saving for retirement is like dieting in that we\u2019re better at making resolutions and excuses than making progress.\n\nBut technology makes the savings part easier, too. More and more employer plans will sign you up automatically. If your employer doesn\u2019t have a plan, you can set up a Roth IRA with a bank or an investment company and have a portion of each paycheck deposited automatically. Some states, including Oregon, Illinois, California and Maryland (whose program I chair), are setting up IRA programs for small businesses that don\u2019t offer retirement plans.\n\nThe good news is that, in one respect, retirement saving is easier than dieting: If you fall off the wagon, you can start again and feel better immediately.\n\nYes, life is complicated. Retirement plans don\u2019t always turn out as planned. But if, while worrying about everything else, we each adhered to the 10% rule as much as we are able, there would be a lot less retirement insecurity and a lot more gold in the golden years.\n\nRead more of the Best New Ideas in Retirement\n\n\u2022 This is what the retirement community of the future looks like\n\n\u2022 Long-term care insurance is a dying industry.
