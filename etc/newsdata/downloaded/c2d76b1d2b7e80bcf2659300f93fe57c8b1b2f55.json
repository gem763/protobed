In July they voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action.\n\nAfter some tentative but unproductive talks, the pilots\u2019 union called strikes for 9, 10 and 27 September. The initial 48-hour walkout caused the cancellation of almost all BA flights on 9 and 10 September, with additional disruption on days either side.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

British Airways has reinstated about half the planned flights.\n\nPassengers who cancelled for a full refund who now wish to travel are entitled to rebook at the same price that they originally paid.\n\nIf BA moved them to an alternative flight, whether on British Airways or another carrier, they can revert to the original departure.\n\nBut if they took a refund, then booked independently on, say, easyJet or Virgin Atlantic, they will not be able to switch back without losing cash.\n\nA spokesperson for BA said: \u201cWe are offering all customers whose flights were cancelled due to next week's planned industrial action, the option to rebook on to a British Airways flight, with a schedule of services to our daily destinations on September 26, 27 and 28 September.\u201d\n\nBalpa says that if \u201cmeaningful talks\u201d do not take place with the airline, further strikes may be called. Its mandate on industrial action lasts until January 2020.", "description": "British Airways has restored around half of its scheduled operation for 27 September, after pilots called off a strike planned for that day.
