Photo: TOBY MELVILLE/WireImage\n\nAfter just a mere four months on this planet, baby Archie is already on his first royal tour \u2014 an opportunity that, well, none of us will ever experience. And, though he has not yet commented on trip, precisely because he cannot talk, the young double Taurus appears to be having the time of his short life.\n\nWhile Archie had to stay behind with his his mysterious nanny during the first two days of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s ten-day tour of Africa, on Wednesday, the little babe eventually got to join in on the fun. In what was his first public appearance on tour, Archie took a trip with mom and dad to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu, where he swiftly became the center of attention.\n\nSome of the visit, I\u2019m assuming, was uncomfortable for Archie; his dad called him an \u201cold soul\u201d and his mom revealed him to be \u201ca flirt,\u201d in front of a Nobel Peace Prize\u2013winner. (Humiliating!!!!) But in nearly every photo and video to surface of Archie during his rare appearance, he bears a li\u2019l smile and inquisitive eyes. Undoubtedly, he\u2019s reveling in his royal-tour life.\n\nLook at those blue-and-white-striped H&M overalls! (Archie must be putting in effort to wear affordable clothing on tour, just like his mom.)\n\nMaster Archie!
