In his ruling, Balkman said the opioid crisis has \"ravaged\" the state of Oklahoma.\n\nThe defendants \"engaged in false and misleading marketing of both their drugs and opioids generally, and the law makes clear that such conduct is more than enough to serve as the act or omission necessary to establish the first element of Oklahoma's public nuisance law,\" Balkman wrote in his ruling (PDF).\n\nFollowing the ruling, Johnson & Johnson announced that it plans to appeal the \"flawed\" judgment.\n\n\"Janssen did not cause the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, and neither the facts nor the law support this outcome,\" Michael Ullmann, executive vice president and general counsel for Johnson & Johnson, said in a written statement on Monday.\n\n\"We recognize the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue and we have deep sympathy for everyone affected.

A federal trial is slated for this fall in which nearly 2,000 cases involving cities, counties, communities and tribal lands have been rolled into one, accusing opioid makers of causing the epidemic.\n\nAttorneys across the nation -- especially those which are part of the trial set for federal court in Ohio this fall -- have been \"watching and learning from the case Oklahoma assembled, while defendants have been watching for vulnerabilities in that case,\" Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said earlier this month\n\nOklahoma previously reached settlements with two other opioid drugmakers: a $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharma , the maker of OxyContin, and an $85 million settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals , one of the world's leading providers of generic drugs.\n\nOklahoma battles Johnson & Johnson\n\nAhead of Monday's verdict, Oklahoma and Johnson & Johnson filed their final pleas to Balkman earlier this month, essentially making one final pitch following seven weeks of trial.\n\nIn its final filing, the state of Oklahoma implored the judge to deliver a record $17.2 billion verdict against Johnson & Johnson for flooding the state with opioids. It said the drug company created a crisis that killed more than 6,000 Oklahomans, destroyed families and wreaked havoc on communities.\n\nThe state had presented an abatement plan of about $17.5 billion at trial, but in its filings, the state reduced the figure to $17.17 billion to account for $355 million the state received in settlements with Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"The source of this crisis is the flood of prescription opioids that has inundated Oklahoma for the past two decades,\" attorneys for the state wrote in its more than 700-page court filing. \"The harm it has wrought, and the threat it continues to pose to the health, safety and welfare of the State, make it the worst nuisance Oklahoma has ever known.\"\n\nThe state essentially argued that Johnson & Johnson was a \"public nuisance.\"\n\nJohnson & Johnson argued in its filing that the state's case was flimsy, saying that the public nuisance accusation is based on \"radical theories unmoored from more than a century of Oklahoma case law.\"\n\n\"In addition to those fundamental legal defects, the State undeniably failed to prove its case,\" Johnson & Johnson said in its nearly 200-page filing.\n\nThe drug company blasted the state's witnesses and argued that the state offered no explanation how its subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, contributed to the opioid crisis.\n\n\"In sum, the State failed to prove that Janssen misleadingly promoted opioids, that any of Janssen's promotions caused any harm in Oklahoma (let alone a crisis of opioid abuse), or that its proposed remedy was a prudent and justified response to the present crisis,\" Johnson & Johnson said.\n\nIn its filing, Johnson & Johnson maintained it did nothing wrong and said the state took \"potshots at stray promotional statements plucked from three decades\" of material to create a wild public nuisance theory.\n\nAmerica's opioid epidemic\n\nAs Oklahoma's trial ran through the summer, so did America's opioid epidemic.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why are opioids so addictive?
