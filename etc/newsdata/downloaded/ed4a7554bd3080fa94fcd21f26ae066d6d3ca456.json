Whoopi Goldberg, star of the 1992 movie Sister Act, is going to lead the cast of a London production of the musical Sister Act, which first ran in Pasadena in 2006, before going to London in 2009, and coming to Broadway in 2011. Goldberg will still play Deloris Van Cartier, the lounge singer who goes into hiding as a nun, in the London revival, alongside Absolutely Fabulous\u2019s Jennifer Saunders as the Mother Superior. The production will run from July 29 to August 30, 2020, at London\u2019s Eventim Apollo theater. \u201cYeah, the original Deloris is back,\u201d Whoopi says in a video interview, \u201ca little older, a little seasoned, but really still kind of out there.\u201d Joyful, Joyful news!
