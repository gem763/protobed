I really enjoyed the first lap. The second also went well, although I began to notice that I was forcing the rear tyres. I still need some time to get used to the sound of the engine. It\u2019s much quieter than any other I\u2019ve driven before, and I\u2019m a very emotional driver.\u201d\n\nEkstr\u00f6m is reportedly working closely with the team of engineers and technicians to fine tune the e-Racer ahead of the launch of the new Electric Touring Car Series which starts next year.\n\nSWNS\n\nSearch for used cars", "description": "The world\u2019s first fully electric touring car has been driven round a racetrack.\u00a0 Cupra, the performance arm of SEAT, has developed\u00a0the e-Racer,\u00a0a zero-emission track car capable of 0-62mph in just 3.2 seconds.
