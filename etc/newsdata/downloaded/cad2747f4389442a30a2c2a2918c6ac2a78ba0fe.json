They parked their army truck under a tree, piled into a civilian car and sped away.\n\nAnother woman from Gubio, whom The Times is also not identifying, said that four terrified soldiers joined her family in hiding, and five more hid in her neighbor\u2019s house. She said they kept silent inside for two days as militants ransacked the town and loudly bragged about how easy it was to seize.\n\nMost of the residents and soldiers fled during the attack, which killed at least three people, officials said. Several days later, Boko Haram returned, looting a hospital of its medicine and setting fire to government buildings and military tents. They sped off in vehicles that the military had left behind.\n\nThat attacks were thought by officials to be carried out by the Islamic State West African Province, a splinter group of about 3,000 fighters that has been endorsed by leaders of the Islamic State. The faction split in 2016 from forces commanded by Boko Haram\u2019s longtime leader Abubakar Shekau, over disapproval of his attacks on Muslim civilians.\n\nSince 2018, the Islamic State faction, which has received propaganda guidance from the Islamic State in Syria, has attacked a brigade headquarters and the hub for a multinational military effort to fight terrorism, swiping large amounts of machinery and weapons, according to officials and analysts.", "description": "After a decade of devastating war with Boko Haram extremists, they are now better armed than ever and have more sophisticated drones than the demoralized Nigerian military.", "authors": ["Dionne Searcey"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/world/xxboko/xxboko-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
