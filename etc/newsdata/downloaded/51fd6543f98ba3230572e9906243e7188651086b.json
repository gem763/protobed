Why would Samsung upgrade to a new material and not tell anyone?\n\nIt didn\u2019t. The video was completely wrong.\n\nSamsung has now confirmed to The Verge that the Note 10\u2019s frame is made from aluminum, just like the company\u2019s other flagships in recent years. It\u2019s odd that such an erroneous voiceover made it into a promotional video. How was it even part of the script? Maybe at one point Samsung was thinking about upgrading the Note 10 to stainless steel a la the iPhone X and XS. But nope.\n\nThe mistake even made it onto Samsung\u2019s website, as SamMobile points out, with the Note 10\u2019s design page originally reading \u201chigh-polish stainless steel\u201d before someone changed it to \u201chigh-polish metal.\u201d Whoops.\n\nThis morning, Samsung reuploaded the \u201cGalaxy Note 10 introduction video\u201d \u2014 with no mention of stainless steel whatsoever.", "description": "Samsung managed to prompt some confusion the other day when a video uploaded to its YouTube channel mentioned that the Galaxy Note 10 was made from \"stainless steel and glass.\" This isn\u2019t true.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJwwGC9zrHjUHvIU2nMkJcHNiYo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18936562/cwelch_190806_3577_0004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
