The missile had been sitting on the seafloor for about year after a failed flight test, said State Department official Thomas G. DiNanno.\n\n\u201cThe explosion was caused by the Skyfall experiencing a criticality accident, an uncontrolled nuclear reaction that released a burst of radiation while Russian personnel retrieved it from the seafloor,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said in an interview with The Washington Times.\n\nThe reactor exploded in the Arkhangelsk region in Russia\u2019s far north near populated areas and triggered concerns about fallout spreading to the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as in Sweden, Denmark and Finland, he said.\n\n\u201cThe missile sat on the seabed since its failed test early last year in close proximity to a major population center,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said.\n\n\u201cWhat really concerns us, No. 1, is the disinformation; No. 2, that it sat at the bottom of the ocean for a year; and No. 3, their first reaction was to cover it up,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. DiNanno is deputy assistant secretary of state and senior official in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. He first disclosed the Skyfall incident Oct. 10 in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly First Committee.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. DiNanno revealed further details about the incident. As part of the cover-up, he said, Moscow cut off Russian nuclear monitoring station data gathered near the blast that is supplied to the International Monitoring System, a technical group based in Vienna that operates as a unit of the Comprehensive Test-Ban-Treaty Organization.\n\nThe blast was set off after the fuel in the missile reactor was no longer cooled by seawater.\n\nSkyfall, which when deployed will be armed with either nuclear or conventional warheads, could strike at a nearly limitless range. It is one of five strategic nuclear weapons that President Putin announced in March 2018 \u201cvery bombastically,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said.\n\nAnother superweapon under development is the Poseidon drone torpedo, also nuclear powered, which will carry a warhead up to 450 kilotons in yield that the State Department arms official described as a \u201cdoomsday weapon.\u201d\n\nThe other three weapons are the Sarmat multiwarhead intercontinental ballistic missile, the Avangard hypersonic missile and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile.\n\n\u201cThese are extremely destabilizing systems. A nuclear powered cruise missile could stay seemingly aloft for a long time,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said.\n\nU.S. monitoring agencies estimated that the environmental impact of the reactor blast was confined locally. \u201cFrom what I understand, the actual radiation cloud was not dangerous per se,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said, \u201cbut our issue is with the lack of transparency and the cover-up and the misinformation.\u201d\n\nThe blast was measured to be 2.4 magnitude on the seismic scale, he said.\n\n\u201cA relatively small explosion but dangerous enough when a nuclear reactor explodes,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said. \u201cThe point here is why was this system flying around in the first place, why after the crash it sat there for a year and why it took a recovery operation to sort of expose the original accident.\u201d\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the blast, Russia state-controlled media gave varying explanations for closures of areas on land and at sea without saying they were the result of a missile.\n\nThe misinformation included statements that the mishap involved a military exercise, a malfunction in a storm warning system and a toxic chemical spill at sea. State-controlled outlets also provided false reports that radiation levels were not elevated.\n\nThe disinformation surrounding the Skyfall incident is eerily similar to Moscow\u2019s cover-up of the deadly 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in what is now Ukraine.\n\nThe first acknowledgment of the Skyfall accident was the state nuclear agency Rosatom\u2019s announcement two days later about the deaths of five scientists.\n\nMr. DiNanno said Skyfall and other superweapons weapons are destabilizing because they are not covered by any arms treaty. The Trump administration is seeking to include the arms in any extended New START accord or a new arms treaty with Russia and China, he said.\n\n\u201cTechnology has rapidly changed, and it\u2019s important that we point out not what New START does, but what it doesn\u2019t do in the 2020 deteriorating security environment. It doesn\u2019t cover these systems,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother major worry is the large number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons held by Russia and China. Any new arms accord should address those weapons, he added.\n\nAsked why the State Department decided to disclose the latest information, Mr. DiNanno said, \u201cWe felt it was important we tell the truth, share what we understood had happened in Nenoska.\u201d\n\nThe department worked with other government agencies to sift through classified data and imagery and then downgraded its classification so it could be shared with allies and partners, and ultimately the public, he said.\n\nThe information about the missile has been known for some time, but the government wanted to make sure it was confident about the accuracy before announcing it to the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see that get a little faster, but getting it right is more important,\u201d Mr. DiNanno said.\n\nMr. DiNanno said the goal of announcing the Skyfall incident at the United Nations was to put the Russians and the Chinese on notice that \u201cwe\u2019re serious about expanding and modernizing the arms control architecture.\u201d\n\nMark Schneider, a former Pentagon nuclear policy official who is now a senior analyst with the National Institute for Public Policy, called the nuclear-powered missile \u201ca monument to Putin\u2019s irresponsibility\u201d and something that \u201cshould never have been created.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concept of this weapon is foolish. Russia does not need its unlimited range potential to penetrate the virtually nonexistent U.S. strategic air defenses. The probability of successful development was always low, and radiation release was inevitable,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia has been questioned about the superweapons, and China so far has rebuffed Trump administration appeals to enter into strategic arms negotiations.\n\nOne clue investigators discovered about the reactor blast was local detection of cesium-137, a nuclear byproduct of fission, a State Department official said.\n\nThat radioactive material is related to a nuclear reactor. Reports from Russia suggested that the radiation near Nenoska may have been the result of plutonium-fueled batteries. The official said that was incorrect.\n\nAnother official described Skyfall as a \u201cflying Superfund site\u201d \u2014 a reference to places the Environmental Protection Agency designates as hazardous waste sites that pose a risk to human life.\n\nThe Russian Embassy did not return an email request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
