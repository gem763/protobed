Trump's assertion that the now deceased ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a coward was \"contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\" Al-Baghdadi killed himself via a suicide vest and murdered three of his children during the explosion. He was using his offspring as a human shield against U.S. forces. After immediate backlash for his column, the Never Trump pundit issued a retraction on his post.\n\n\"An earlier version included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward. That was removed b/c it wrongly conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous. As I wrote Sun: Baghdadi was 'a sick and depraved man,'\" Boot tweeted. The statement was also added to his column.\n\nAn earlier version included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward.

Boot has long been a \"Never Trump\" media pundit invited on to CNN to discuss his insane rantings against the current president. The most notable thing about him is his fedora.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:56:48PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/301/c6e6cc58-ef6d-4056-b4ad-3e9144ddddeb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
