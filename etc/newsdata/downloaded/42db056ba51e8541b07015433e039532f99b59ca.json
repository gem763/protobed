Nearly 70 such projects are on track to be completed in 2020, setting a record for development of this type, according to Savills.\n\n\n\nMore: Dubai\u2019s New Luxury Residential Projects Appeal to Affordability as Market Cools\n\n\u201cBranding a residential development lends a point of difference that will become ever more important in challenging market conditions,\u201d said Savills director Riyan Itani, who co-heads the brokerage\u2019s international development consultancy.\n\n\n\nThe benefit to residents ranges from access to hotel-run rental programs, and a higher ratio of onsite staff to niche amenity spaces and interiors designed famed lifestyle brands.\n\n\n\nA flurry of activity in Dubai, in particular, will see the Middle East\u2019s financial center unseat New York City as the leading city for branded residences.\n\n\n\nNew York has long been the global leader for towers slapped with household names, including U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s eponymous brand. In the short walk along the southern edge of Central Park, one passes the Residences at the Ritz Carlton, the Mandarin Oriental residences and Trump International.\n\n\n\nBut there are only five branded residence projects currently underway in the Big Apple compared to a whopping 22 in the works in Dubai.\n\n\n\nMiami is the third global leader, with 20 completed buildings and another four under construction, according to the research from Savills.\n\n\n\nDriving the trends are developers chasing higher profit margins in the sometimes cramped luxury development space underscore the trend. Buyers pay a 35% premium on average to live in such developments, according to Savills research, which compared sales to equivalent non-branded sales in the vicinity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrice premiums are only one advantage of branded residences. Greater project visibility, design and marketing expertise and access to the brand\u2019s customer base are a few of the benefits for developers,\u201d according to the report. \u201cOwners, meanwhile, benefit from owning a stake in a reputable brand, [and] have access to superior services and amenities.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat has attracted distinctive lifestyle and even media companies to reach for a slice of the pie. Last year, media company Conde Nast announced it would team with developers to create curated living spaces.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Novelist George Eliot\u2019s Former South London Home Asking \u00a32.8M\n\nWell-known hotel operators and hospitality brands have long dominated this niche segment of the housing market, including leading players like Marriott, Four Seasons, Hyatt and Dubai-based Emaar Hospitality Group. Hoteliers account for 86% of the completed projects and a whopping 96% of those in the development pipeline.\n\n\n\nBut a number of fashion houses and supercar brands, including Porsche, Mercedes, Missoni and Versace, have licensed out their names for such projects. Roughly 80 different brands have their names attached to a branded residence and 30 more brands are on track to enter the market in the coming years, according to Savills.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111808?size=1.5384615384615385&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
