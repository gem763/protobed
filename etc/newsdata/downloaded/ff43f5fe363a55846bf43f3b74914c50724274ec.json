The drone fits into Anduril's existing perimeter defense hardware and software suite, which includes other drones and surveillance towers.\n\n\u201cUnmanned aerial systems have long been notoriously difficult to defend against: they are widely available, inexpensive, and dangerous in the wrong hands,\u201d Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf said in an emailed statement to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cOur counter-UAS solution applies automated target acquisition to give human operators the capability to quickly and effectively neutralize these growing aerial threats.\u201d\n\nThe fast-moving startup began shipping the drones, called \u201cInterceptors,\u201d to the U.S. and U.K. military earlier this year and is apparently already deploying them abroad to unspecified conflict zones.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s report, Anduril\u2019s Interceptors aren\u2019t just aiming to batter other drones out of the sky. In the future, the company would like its drones to fend off attacks from \u201cultralight aircraft, or a helicopter, or a cruise missile.\u201d\n\nCoordinated with Anduril\u2019s flurry of press for its latest plans, blue chip venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz confirmed reports that it would invest in the company at a valuation around $1 billion, joining Founders Fund and General Catalyst.\n\n\u201cAs with all of our investments, this is a bet on not just the technology (breathtaking) and the market (enormous) but also the people (outstanding),\u201d Marc Andreessen wrote in a breathless blog post announcing the investment.\n\n\u201cPalmer Luckey is a founder and technology visionary we are proud to be backing for the second time, after Oculus.\u201d", "description": "One of Trump\u2019s biggest supporters in tech is now building drones that can autonomously find targets and knock them out of the air.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570132483/RTX1G4QX_1_zpme6k"}
