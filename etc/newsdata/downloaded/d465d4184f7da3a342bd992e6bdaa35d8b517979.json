Critics accuse the former vice president of forcing out a Ukrainian prosecutor who was said to have been investigating an oligarch linked to Burisma, though that investigation had been dormant, nor did it involve potential wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.\n\nMoreover, the prosecutor\u2019s ouster was widely backed by the international community and even Republicans in Congress at the time.\n\nBut Trump, with the help of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, has set to cast both roles as signs of corruption, and Trump's ask of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this summer to investigate the Bidens has landed him in a scandal that has jeopardized his presidency.\n\nBiden said that he had no regrets about joining Burisma, only that he did not foresee the potential political fallout of the move.\n\n\"I regret not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea which has again been completely debunked by everyone,\" he said.\n\nPressed by ABC\u2019s Amy Robach about whether he should have anticipated the political storm now swirling, Biden got more defensive.\n\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m a human and you know what, did I make a mistake?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell maybe in the grand scheme of things. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/ec/cb7493f749d09c1c544f354f4561/20191013-hunter-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
