They had to contend with whipsawing bond markets, which were pricing in almost three quarter-point rate cuts for 2019 at the start of September but expected fewer than two ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s meeting.\n\nThen came repo madness.\n\nIncredibly, and seemingly out of nowhere, the usually tranquil plumbing of the financial system went haywire. And that might be putting it mildly. The rate for general collateral repurchase agreements in the more than $2 trillion repo market reached a record 10% on Tuesday. The effective fed funds rate broke policy makers\u2019 2.25% cap on Wednesday. This isn\u2019t supposed to happen.\n\nAnd yet, this week\u2019s developments didn\u2019t even merit a mention in the FOMC statement. Some analysts, like Matthew Hornbach at Morgan Stanley, said it was likely the Fed would announce permanent open market operations. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, said in a webcast on Tuesday that the central bank might expand its balance sheet as a way of \u201cbaby stepping\u201d to more quantitative easing.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the Fed doesn\u2019t care, or that it won\u2019t ultimately adopt those measures. Most likely, it just didn\u2019t have enough time to react in a big way.\n\nPolicy makers did drop the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER, by 30 basis points to regain control over short-term rates. The IOER rate had been set at the upper bound of the fed funds range until June 2018, when the Fed raised it by only 20 basis points. It\u2019s now down to 1.8%, while the 25-basis-point cut to the fed funds rate sets the range at 1.75% to 2%. Basically, if stress in funding markets keeps pushing short-term rates higher, the sharper cut in IOER makes it somewhat less likely that the fed funds rate will breach the upper bound.\n\nPowell eventually addressed repo markets head-on, largely at the prodding of reporters:\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we\u2019re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to be assessing the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be revisiting that question during this inter-meeting period and certainly at our next meeting.\n\nWe\u2019ve always said that the level is uncertain. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve tried to be very clear about. We\u2019ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess what they say is their demand for reserves\u2026\n\nBut yes, there\u2019s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we\u2019ll need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought. That\u2019s always been a possibility.\u201d\n\nThe key word he seemed to stress was \u201corganic.\u201d That\u2019s because any hint of expanding the balance sheet can be misconstrued as a resumption of post-crisis quantitative easing. However, it would be a mistake to consider it the same as QE. Hornbach explained it eloquently on Bloomberg TV before the Fed\u2019s decision:\n\n\u201cQuantitative easing, the purpose of that is to expand reserves in the system from the status quo of the reserves that are needed to keep liquidity and the fed funds target within that range. When you start losing control of the target rate, you need to increase reserves in the system, but that\u2019s not necessarily quantitative easing as we know it in a traditional sense. They\u2019re not trying to ease monetary policy, they\u2019re trying to get better control over that short-term interest rate.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the type of nuance that can get lost on investors if the Fed, and those who write about it, aren\u2019t careful.\n\nIn fact, Wednesday\u2019s interest-rate decision could be seen as something of a \u201chawkish cut.\u201d Policy makers\u2019 \u201cdot plot\u201d signaled sharp divisions among policy makers, as Powell predicted, with the median estimates calling for no more rate cuts through 2020. It then shows one quarter-point hike in 2021 and another in 2022, albeit with many different estimates.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate decision on Wednesday was never going to be easy for Chair Jerome Powell.He and his colleagues had to reach consensus on how to weigh the U.S.-China trade war against\u00a0a still-solid labor market and American consumer, not to mention signs of a", "authors": ["Brian Chappatta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VdC2tA82gQyfU.UxTHn8dw--~B/aD03NDY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/4b67a43c2b687ddb186795b0b5fed1d3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
