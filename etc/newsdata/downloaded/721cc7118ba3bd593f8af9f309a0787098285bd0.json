Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nWith a nine-year payment history and a 3.1% yield, many investors probably find Bergs Timber intriguing. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Bergs Timber for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nOM:BRG B Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Bergs Timber paid out 15% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Unfortunately, while Bergs Timber pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.\n\nIs Bergs Timber's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Bergs Timber has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Bergs Timber is carrying net debt of 3.15 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Bergs Timber has EBIT of 9.40 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Bergs Timber's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. The first recorded dividend for Bergs Timber, in the last decade, was nine years ago. It's good to see that Bergs Timber has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was kr0.25 in 2010, compared to kr0.08 last year. Dividend payments have fallen sharply, down 68% over that time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Bergs Timber AB (publ) (STO:BRG B) from a dividend investor's perspective.
