It's basically the same as the M8 that made its debut earlier this year, but in bigger four-door form. The Gran Coupe's longer wheelbase and added weight means it'll drive differently to the two-door M8, while the added overall length, height and width mean there'll be more space for the two folks in the rear seats. Otherwise, same basic thing.\n\nBut look at the color BMW chose to launch it in. It's a purple called Ametrin Metallic, and it's lovely. A BMW spokesperson confirmed to R&T that this color will be made available for the two-door M8 as well.\n\nPhoto credit: BMW More\n\nBMW has offered purples on a handful of M cars in the past, and via its Individual customization program. The E34 M5 was offered in a shade called Daytona Violet, which suited the car perfectly.\n\nPhoto credit: Steven Tyler PJs - Flickr More\n\nAnd one of the three best colors for the E36 M3 is this, the brilliantly named Techno Violet. (The other two are British Racing Green and Dakar Yellow, if you're wondering.)\n\nBack to the M8 Gran Coupe. Like the M8 Coupe (and the M5), power comes through a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 pumping out 600 hp in the base car, and 617 hp in the Competition model. The Gran Coupe also gets BMW M's new variable four-wheel drive system, which allows the front axle to be decoupled entirely if you're not put off by big tire bills. The transmission is an eight-speed automatic with M-specific tuning.\n\nThe Gran Coupe is 185 pounds heavier than its coupe sibling, but it can still run to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds and onto a top speed of 155 mph. If you get the Competition, the 0-60 sprint is a tenth quicker, and optioning the M Driver's Package for either model ups top speed to 190 mph.\n\nThe base M8 Gran Coupe carries a $130,995 base price (with destination), while the Competition costs $13,000 more. That's makes this car over $25,000 more expensive than the mechanically similar (though somewhat smaller) M5, but, it's actually $3000 less than the two-door Coupe.\n\nBMW is also doing a M8 Gran Coupe Launch Edition that comes in its own unique shade\u2014Diamant Green metallic. Remarkably, a BMW spokesperson tells us its gold-tint daytime running lamps are production-spec. The look is evocative of the M8 Gran Coupe concept BMW first showed last year. Just 50 examples of 400 worldwide will come to the US.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The color is called Ametrin Metallic.
