Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cTurkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully \u2026 understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\u201d", "description": "Trump says Turkey \u2018is an important member in good standing\u2019 of NATO.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Wesley Morgan", "David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179668641-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
