What\u2019s far more important is the burden of government spending.\n\nWhether the budget is financed by taxes or borrowing, the level of spending is what really matters. Simply stated, that number measures the amount of money that politicians divert from the economy\u2019s productive sector.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s sometimes very illuminating to look at why red ink goes up and down.\n\nSo I went to the Treasury Department\u2019s most-recent Monthly Treasury Statement and looked at the raw numbers. What did I find?\n\nLo and behold, the deficit jumped to $984 billion because outlays are increasing twice as fast as revenue.\n\nPerhaps even more discouraging, the burden of spending is rising more than four times faster than needed to keep pace with inflation.\n\nThese are very discouraging numbers, especially when you keep in mind that this is the calm before the storm. Because of poorly designed entitlement programs and an ageing population, our fiscal situation will deteriorate even faster in the future.\n\nUnless there\u2019s much-needed reform.\n\nBut I\u2019m not holding out much hope.
