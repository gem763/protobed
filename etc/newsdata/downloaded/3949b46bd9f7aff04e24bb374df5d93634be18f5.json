In part because of actions taken by Richard Nixon, we bind our law enforcement agencies very tightly in terms of what they can and can't investigate. There are processes that they have to go through.\u201d\n\nBut Trump, she said, was attempting to subvert that process by asking a foreign government to investigate American citizens to benefit him politically.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's John Malcom offered a contradictory analysis. \u201cAbuse of power can constitute an impeachable offense and we are going to learn more facts,\u201d he offered. \u201cI think it is quite a stretch to say based on the transcript released today that we are anywhere near that threshold. There was no threat explicitly or implicitly to withhold aid from the Ukraine government during this call.\u201d\n\nAdam Serwer: This is why the impeachment clause exists\n\nWhere Trump critics see nefarious implications, he sees ambiguity. In the context of the call, he argued, it seems to him that President Trump was more interested in how the investigation into his 2016 campaign began than the Ukrainian investigation into a firm that employed Biden\u2019s son.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he continued, Biden\u2019s son did seem to earn a suspicious amount of money from a Ukrainian company given his dearth of experience in the relevant field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not excusing what the president did,\u201d he insisted, but added, \u201che often acts in an intemperate manner.\u201d (Side note: That would seem to imply that a pattern of intemperance is somehow mitigating.) \u201cLook,\u201d he concluded, \u201cI think it is very unclear from what we know now. I certainly don\u2019t see the Senate being anywhere near being ready to have two-thirds of the body conclude that the president is ready to be voted out of office.\u201d\n\nTwo members of Congress who took the stage after Jurecic and Malcolm, one a Republican and the other a Democrat, also gave dramatically different interpretations of the Ukraine situation.\n\nRepublican Congressman Lance Gooden asserted that Democrats know the phone call isn\u2019t a slam-dunk case for impeachment, even though he declared it \u201chard to defend.\u201d When my colleague Elaina Plott asked if he would object if a Democratic president urged a foreign leader to investigate a GOP rival, he evaded the question.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump\u2019s incriminating conversation with the Ukrainian president\n\nBut Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff claimed that if Republicans looked at identical behavior from a politician who didn\u2019t have an R beside his name, they would immediately conclude that a grave, impeachable offense had been perpetrated. \u201cWe knew that courage is contagious,\u201d he declared. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned during the presidency of Donald Trump is that so is cowardice.\u201d\n\nOn the initial, binary question of whether Trump perpetrated an offense that the Framers would regard as impeachable, there is only one correct answer. But the two factions might as well inhabit different realities, given their divergent rhetoric and conclusions. And many Americans will react by aligning with their tribe.\n\nImpeachable or not, Trump\u2019s behavior is tearing the country apart.", "description": "The debate about President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/9_25_Battle_for_the_Constitution_Gallup7/facebook.jpg?1569509805", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
