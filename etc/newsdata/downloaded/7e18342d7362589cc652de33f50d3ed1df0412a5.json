Seven shareholders will own 90 per cent of the proposed combined group, with Prime shareholders owning the final 10 per cent. The offer was a 3 per cent discount on Thursday's close share price before the deal was announced on Friday.\n\nFormer Domain chief executive-turned-regional publisher Antony Catalano continues to hang around Seven's move on Prime. Sources indicated he was trying to contact major Prime shareholders, including Bruce Gordon, who owns rival regional broadcaster WIN and has so far not publicly expressed a view on the transaction.\n\nMr Gordon holds 11.6 per cent of Prime shares. He also has another 8.1 per cent cash-settled share swap in his rival broadcaster, taking his total economic interest to 19.7 per cent. Mr Gordon is the largest shareholder in Nine, publisher of the Financial Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpheria portfolio manager Matt Booker, whose fund owns 14.4 per cent of Prime, expressed support for the deal on Friday.\n\nIt remains unclear what Mr Catalano is planning to do. Seven holds a change of control provision over Prime so would need to approve any alternate deal. Seven and Prime sources remained confident shareholders will support the transaction. Representatives for Mr Gordon did not return calls on Sunday.\n\nIn June, Mr Catalano finalised the $125 million acquisition of Australian Community Media (ACM) from Nine.\n\nMr Catalano is known to be keen to build a larger cross-platform regional media business and it's believed he has been interested in Prime. There has been speculation Mr Catalano and ACM were the party that scooped up around 3 per cent of Prime when Mr Gordon was forced by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to sell down his total exposure to the stock to under 20 per cent last month.\n\nThe ACM executive chairman remained quiet over the weekend about whether he intended to take any further action. There has been speculation Mr Catalano has increased his holding in Prime, which he would be required to disclose within three days if he had passed the 5 per cent substantial shareholder threshold.", "description": "Sources say executives from Bauer Media have flown into Australia to hash out the potential acquisition of Pacific Magazines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_89/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2127f53466608c78a3814d75b6241253a1d2a0da", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
