Around 75 per cent of all sufferers show these behavioural symptoms.\n\nBut usually there is a reason for them being upset \u2013 they may be in pain, uncomfortable or thirsty, but unable to express their emotions.\n\nMedics currently treat patients with a mixture of drugs, exercise and therapies. But there has been little research pitting the treatments against one another to see which is more beneficial.\n\nResearchers compared 163 clinical trials involving 23,143 dementia sufferers who showed symptoms including aggression and agitation.\n\nResults showed exercise, massages, as well as touch and musical therapy were more effective than antipsychotics at treating the behavioural problems.\n\nThe findings are published in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAntipsychotics are given to dementia patients to sedate them if they become agitated or aggressive.\n\nBut usually there is a reason for them being upset \u2013 they may be in pain, uncomfortable or thirsty, but unable to express their emotions.\n\nResearchers have previously found that the medication is routinely given to residents in care homes to calm them down and stop them from wandering off.\n\nThe Department of Health promised to drastically reduce their use in 2009 as part of a national dementia strategy, which identified major failings in care.\n\nOne study linked antipsychotics to 1,800 premature deaths in the UK each year, while other research has shown they increase the risk of strokes by nine-fold.\n\nThere are roughly 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK and 5.8million in the US.", "description": "Toronto researchers found patients who have symptoms of aggression as a result of the disorder responded better to outdoor activities than antipsychotic drugs.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697694-0-image-a-5_1571064811230.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
