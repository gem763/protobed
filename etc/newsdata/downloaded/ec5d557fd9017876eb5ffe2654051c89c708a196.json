There are currently 35 locations across the US; eight will become Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings stores after the transaction closes, which should happen in mid-October. Earlier this year, the company noted that it did not plan to open any new Field & Stream stores.\n\nDick's CEO Ed Stack said in a March earnings call that the company was \"not sure exactly what we're gonna do\" with the Field & Stream brand. UBS analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a note on Friday that the company \"is contemplating whether to run it in its current state or convert the space to a different concept. It could also sell the chain altogether.\"\n\nDick's is currently conducting a strategic review of its hunting business as a whole.
