Here\u2019s a look around.\n\n\u2022 Joe Mixon (ankle) did some work Friday after missing the two previous days. He\u2019s trending in the right direction, but get that Sunday confirmation. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m feeling optimistic about the Zac Taylor offense.\n\n\u2022 Mike Williams (knee) is questionable and considered a game-time call at Detroit. In Week 2, without the bye weeks in play, you probably have playable fallbacks. Ah, the cursed Chargers. The team is hopeful Hunter Henry (knee) will return this year; if you don\u2019t have IR spots or a very large bench, he\u2019s a rueful fantasy cut. Kicker Michael Badgley (groin) had a partial practice week and might play, but you don\u2019t want to risk anything on a kicker who might not be 100 percent.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2022 Sam Darnold (mono) is expected to miss multiple games. The Jets have a Week 4 bye; perhaps Darnold will be ready to return in Week 5. Trevor Siemian is the stand-in. Le\u2019Veon Bell (shoulder) did some work Friday and is expected to go Monday against Cleveland.\n\n\u2022 James White is uncertain for Sunday\u2019s game at Miami, as his wife is expecting a child any day now. More potential fun for Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead (the minimum $10 in Yahoo DFS). Antonio Brown was with the Patriots all week and is likely to make his debut.\n\n\u2022 Derrius Guice (knee) landed on injured reserve Friday, which means he\u2019s out at least two months. He had surgery Thursday. Adrian Peterson takes over as the early-down back, with Chris Thompson still the third-down option. Jordan Reed (concussion) is out indefinitely, giving Vernon Davis some deeper-league appeal.\n\nAdrian Peterson is set for a heavy workload with Derrius Guice landing on IR.

Golden Tate is still serving his four-game suspension, and Sterling Shepard (concussion) won\u2019t play Week 2.\n\n\u2022 The Ravens are expecting to have Mark Andrews (foot), Mark Ingram (shoulder) and Hollywood Brown (hip) for Sunday\u2019s home opener against Arizona. All three had limited practice weeks.\n\n\u2022 Keke Coutee (ankle) had a good week of practice and isn\u2019t even on the injury report. He\u2019ll play against Jacksonville. Incidentally, his last name is pronounced Q-T.\n\n\u2022 Albert Wilson is dealing with calf and hamstring injuries and won\u2019t play against New England.\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL Million Dollar Baller for Week 2 with no fee]\n\n\u2022 Although JuJu Smith-Schuster (toe) was gimpy at the end of the New England blowout, he\u2019s not on the injury report and had two full days of practice to end the week. I expect the Steelers to bounce back strong here \u2014 for whatever reason, New England has their number. Ben Roethlisberger has a solid resume in these spots.\n\n\u2022 Dante Pettis (groin) is likely to play at Cincinnati, but I need a show-me game before I go anywhere near him. Tevin Coleman (ankle) is out indefinitely, putting Raheem Mostert into the sleeper discussion and custom-dictionary list.\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "It's still a fairly modest injury report for Week 2.
