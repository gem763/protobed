As international leaders call for action and the Brazilian military attempts to battle the flames, researchers have started to warn that if the spate of fires continues to spread into the forest, the flames could bring a massive transformation to the region. The process could turn once-moist jungles into dry wastelands, killing ancient trees, making them more vulnerable to future fires and releasing millennia of trapped carbon into the air.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how much harm the tens of thousands of recent blazes, most of which have been linked to a spike in slash-and-burn deforestation, will end up causing. However, decades of research provides a picture of what may happen next. When the Amazon burns, the consequences are often devastating because the ecosystem evolved for millions of years without fire. Amazonian trees simply lack the necessary adaptations to survive the heat, says Ane Alencar, a geographer at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nPast studies conducted near the city of Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon, have demonstrated that when some areas are chopped down but not burned, then fast-growing trees with large leaves that branch out like a candelabrum start appearing, providing shade and cooling the air. Over time, some of the plants that originally occupied the land can regrow from surviving sprouts or seeds buried in the soil or brought by visiting birds and other animals.\n\nThe resulting environment is dark and humid. \u201cIt looks and feels a little more like a forest,\u201d says Emilio Bruna, a tropical biologist and director of the Florida-Brazil Linkage Institute at the University of Florida.\n\nScorched forests do not recover so easily. A few years after a fire burns through an area of the Amazon, the lush vegetation is often replaced with a dense patch of scrawny trees that take up most of the space. The flames can also kill the seeds of other species, and scientists have observed that many birds tend to stay away. \u201cYou walk into a burned area and you notice it\u2019s brighter, it\u2019s hotter, and it just feels drier,\u201d says Jos Barlow, an ecologist at Lancaster University in Lancashire, England. Barlow started working in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998, a time when the smoke and flames of forest fires shut down airports, increased hospitalizations, caused blackouts, and cost the country $5 billion in damages.\n\nthe smoke and flames of forest fires shut down airports, increased hospitalizations, caused blackouts, and cost Brazil $5 billion\n\nEarlier this year, an international team looked at 56 sites spread across 10 countries in the Americas to study how these tropical forests, both burned and unburned, regrow over time. The results of the study suggest that they can recover about 80 percent of the tree species they lost within 20 years. \u201cThe thing is that [50] years later you still don\u2019t have a regenerated Amazonian forest,\u201d explains Bruna. Though after half a century, the number of tree species is the same as before, the study concludes, centuries will need to pass until the abundance of those species goes back to normal.\n\nEven beyond regrowth, the effects of fires can be long-lasting.\n\nIn the years after a fire in the Amazon, the larger trees \u2014 some of which can be a 1,000 years old \u2014 start to die. The causes are varied, according to Barlow. Some of the roots and trunks that normally hold the trees in place might have been damaged, making them more vulnerable to be thrown by the wind. The flames might also open them up to diseases, allowing pathogens and termites to move in.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have an equivalent rainforest for hundreds of years. And that\u2019s hundreds of years we don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken thousands and thousands of years of carbon accumulation, you\u2019ve vaporized it and you\u2019ve put it into the atmosphere,\u201d explains Bruna. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have an equivalent rainforest for hundreds of years. And that\u2019s hundreds of years we don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, for example, a group of Brazilian scientists discovered that once-burned forests across the Amazon hold 25 percent less carbon than those that were not set ablaze, even after 31 years of regrowth.\n\nThe record-breaking fires at the Amazon have caused great concern among Brazil\u2019s scientific community. \u201cI\u2019m really afraid that we go back to the 90s. Those were very difficult years,\u201d says Alencar, who witnessed the consequences of the blazes at the time. \u201cBrazil lost a lot during that period.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what happens next depends on how the Brazilian government chooses to respond.\n\nIn an attempt to douse the fires, President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration signed a 60-day national decree on August 28th, prohibiting people to light up the forest. But some feel skeptical about whether this measure will provide much-needed relief.\n\n\u201cThe peak of the dry season will still be hitting the Amazon in 60-days\u2019 time, when that moratorium is lifted,\u201d says Barlow. With no environment agency on the ground enforcing it, Bolsonaro\u2019s decree might be ineffective, he adds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alarmed and concerned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alarmed and concerned,\u201d Barlow tells The Verge. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated because I know that actions could be taken to actually make the lives of local Amazonians better\u201d and protect the remaining rainforest. It\u2019s been done before. Between 2005 and 2012, deforestation and forest fires in Brazil declined significantly. The country also expanded its protected areas and promoted nationwide campaigns to educate people on how to prevent accidental fires.\n\nTo date, about 80 percent of the Brazilian Amazon remains standing. The areas that have been torched in the past few months will suffer changes, but the most drastic ones could still be avoided. Once a patch of forest burns, Barlow explains, it\u2019s more likely to go up in flames again with renewed force, which is why preventing the fires from spreading and from occurring in the future should be a top priority.\n\nLuckily, the past shows that this is possible with increased education and protection. These measures don\u2019t need \u201cto be high-tech or particularly difficult,\u201d says Barlow. \u201cThey just require will.\u201d", "description": "The Brazilian Amazon continues to burn.
