Climbing will be included at the Olympics for the first time next year as the games head to Tokyo\n\nThe clip shows Rahayu warming up by rubbing her hands together and shaking out her shoulders.\n\nShe grips the first hold - the plastic 'rock' that juts from the wall - and checks her grip on wall A.\n\nHer opponent, on wall B, stands poised in the same position.\n\nThe two women wait for the flashing light on the left to turn a steady green and when it does, they begin to rapidly climb.\n\nYiling slips on the second hold allowing Rahayu to soar ahead by throwing herself up the almost sheer face.\n\nWhen she reaches the top, she smashes an orange button that stops the clock and falls backwards in relief.\n\nShe punches the air as she is let down the wall slowly, celebrating her groundbreaking win.\n\nFootage of the feat was posted to Twitter by Mark Serrels who commented: 'Women's speed climbing record was smashed.
