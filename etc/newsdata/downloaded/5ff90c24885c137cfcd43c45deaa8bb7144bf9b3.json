Artists and citizens from across the continent voiced their anger on social media, with some threatening retaliation.\n\nPolice spokesman for Gauteng province, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, said they were \"experiencing a dramatic decline in public violence and looting\" as the number people arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attacks on foreigners had increased to 289 since Sunday.\n\n\"Taking action against people from other nations is not justified and should never be allowed in our beautiful country ... We need to quell those incidents of unrest,\" Ramaphosa told an event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) Africa three-day summit starting on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa must be a country where everyone feels safe, including women and foreign nationals,\u201d Ramaphosa said, also condemning incidents where women had been killed.\n\nHundreds of mainly female students protesting about violence against women tried to storm the conference centre in Cape Town where the WEF conference was being held, but they were restrained by police who later used stun grenades against demonstrators.\n\n\"Women get raped in this country every single day and nothing is happening. The president is sitting there inside having a fancy lunch with all these people trying to sell our country to the world, (while) there is no peace and no justice,\" said a student protester from the University of Cape Town, who declined to be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nREGIONAL INTEGRATION\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame and Malawi\u2019s Peter Mutharika pulled out of the conference at the last minute, prompting speculation in South African media that the no-shows were linked to the attacks on foreigners.\n\nSouth Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said the leaders who had confirmed attendance were all taking part, adding attendance was \"satisfactory\".\n\nWEF spokesman Oliver Cann said Kagame and Mutharika had informed conference organisers that they could not attend by Saturday, before the attacks had started.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s foreign minister, part of a large Zimbabwean government contingent including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, said the attacks were \u201cunfortunate\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that African brothers go against each other neck on neck in that kind of scenario, in an environment where we are looking forward to regional integration and co-operation and where Africa as a whole has embraced the continental free trade agreement as a bedrock of integration,\u201d Sibusiso Moyo told Reuters.\n\nThere are a significant number of Zimbabweans living in South Africa and they have formerly borne the brunt of attacks on foreigners, along with Somalians and Nigerians.\n\nImmigration to South Africa from across Africa and from parts of southeast Asia picked up in the early 1990s, spurred by the end of apartheid rule and the economic boom that followed.\n\nBut in recent years, attacks against foreign-owned businesses have become a regular occurrence as frustration mounts over high rates of unemployment, currently around 29%, the highest level in a decade.\n\nSome 60 people were killed in a wave of attacks around the country directed against foreigners in 2008. Another outbreak of violence killed at least seven people in 2015.", "description": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told officials and business leaders on Wednesday that he was committed to quelling attacks on foreigners that have threatened to cast a cloud over an economic forum aimed at boosting intra-African trade.
