Biden signaled this week that he could be rethinking his theory that the GOP will have an epiphany about bipartisanship once President Trump leaves the White House, as Republicans, including some of his old friends, joined the White House\u2019s counteroffensive against him and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Biden entered the presidential race touting his ability to cut through partisanship in Washington and promoting the idea that he could do it again if elected president.\n\nBut the 76-year-old changed his tune, albeit briefly, at a campaign stop this week, broadening his critique of Mr. Trump to include Republicans who have piled onto the \u201csmear\u201d campaign against him and his family.\n\n\u201cHis party fans out to carry the smear, are blanketing the airwaves \u2014 paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency,\u201d Mr. Biden said this week in Nevada. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nBefore that, Mr. Biden had been training most of his fire on Mr. Trump and glossing over the fact that nearly every congressional Republican has stuck behind the president in the Ukraine whistleblower saga and run with the White House\u2019s assertion that the real evildoers in the caper are the Bidens.\n\nJim Manley, a Democratic consultant, said the Biden epiphany theory is aging \u201cvery poorly\u201d in the 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cIt was a bad idea in the beginning when he first said it and after the last couple weeks it is a worse idea now,\u201d Mr. Manley said. \u201cNo one \u2014 I repeat, no one \u2014 could possibly think if we get Trump out of office that the GOP is going to change and Sen. Mitch McConnell is going to become a master dealmaker in addressing the pressing needs of the American public.\u201d\n\nWhile the pressure Mr. Trump put on Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens\u2019 business dealings has made some lawmakers uncomfortable and has opened the door for his starry-eyed primary rivals to back impeachment, Republican leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers are publicly keeping a unified front inside the halls of Congress.\n\nThey\u2019re swatting away the anti-Trump attacks and echoing the president\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden shielded his son from a corruption investigation by pushing for the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor.\n\nThe guardians of the Trump galaxy include swing-vote lawmakers such as Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is up for reelection and faces a primary challenge.\n\nHe told WXII 12 Winston-Salem on Thursday that Democrats are too fixated on their desire to reverse the results of the 2016 election and said Congress should consider investigating the allegations against Mr. Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the remarks Mr. Biden delivered Wednesday in Nevada are a far cry from the bipartisan vision he sketched out in May during his first campaign swing through New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThe thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters at the time. \u201cYou will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d\n\nOne of those GOP friends, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said over the weekend he \u201cloves Joe Biden,\u201d and then called for a special investigation into the role Mr. Biden played in the dismissal of a Ukranian prosecutor investigating the energy company where his son was a board member making $50,000 a month.\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s on the board being investigated for corruption and the guy doing the investigation is asked to be fired by Biden \u2014 I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt smells to high heaven.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump raised the stakes Wednesday by calling on Ukrainian and Chinese officials to investigate the \u201ccrooked\u201d Bidens.\n\n\u201cI think Biden is going down,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at The White House. \u201cNow you may very well find that there are many other countries they scammed just like they scammed China and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign said Mr. Trump is \u201cflailing and melting down on national television.\u201d It also celebrated reports that CNN refused to run a Trump 2020 campaign television ad that included the Biden-Ukraine allegations, saying it included falsehoods and attacks against the network\u2019s employees.\n\nThat followed a Politico report over the weekend that said team Biden was demanding television networks stop booking former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Gulliani, saying the president\u2019s attorney has \u201cdemonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d\n\nNeil Sroka, of Democracy for America, a liberal group, said Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cepiphany\u201d theory has proven to be more \u201cdelusional\u201d than it was when he introduced it months ago and said the GOP has no interest in playing nice.\n\nMr. Sroka likened Mr. Biden\u2019s reluctance to take a firmer stand against Republicans to the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip, where Lucy repeatedly pulls the football away from Charlie Brown before he can kick it.\n\n\u201cIt is like he is playing the role of Charlie Brown, but Lucy is not even putting the ball down,\u201d Mr. Sroka said. \u201cIt is mind-boggling.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
