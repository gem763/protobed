Leaders had planned to announce a preliminary deal on Nov. 4 during meetings hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the people said.\n\nChief negotiators are still confident they can reach a broad agreement on the deal to reduce tariffs, known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), during a planned meeting on Thursday in Bangkok, the people said. Any announcement would pave the way for nations to finalize the details on the legal framework in the coming months.\n\nA breakthrough after seven years of talks would mark a win for trade liberalization in an era of rising tariffs and resurgent nationalism. The deal would also further integrate Asia\u2019s economies with China at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to convince the region to shun Chinese infrastructure loans and 5G technology.\n\nIndia, which has raised some tariffs under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has long been the main holdout on an RCEP deal due to strong domestic opposition over fears the country would be flooded with cheap Chinese goods.\n\nIndia Demands\n\nModi, who is fresh off a landslide re-election win in May, agreed to move ahead with the deal after receiving personal assurances from Chinese President Xi Jinping in an informal seaside meeting earlier this month, an Indian official said. China has long pushed to conclude the pact, which also includes Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and 10 Southeast Asian nations.\n\nStill, India came up with new demands after a broad RCEP agreement was concluded, seeking changes in base duties and product-specific rules, according to an Indian official. Two Indian officials said Modi\u2019s government would push for further concessions but is likely to agree to sign due to fears that India could be left out of the announcement, forcing it to negotiate with countries on a bilateral basis.\n\nThe office of the prime minister in India didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for India\u2019s trade ministry didn\u2019t answer two calls made to her mobile phone.\n\n\u2018New Energy\u2019\n\n\u201cI have been quite skeptical of a robust RCEP coming to conclusion, due entirely to India\u2019s intransigence,\u201d said Richard Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in U.S. India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cHowever, since Modi\u2019s re-election, there seems to be new energy behind completing the deal despite serious concerns about how it could impact India\u2019s trade balance with China.\u201d\n\nIndia will cut duties for more than 90% of items for most nations in RCEP, excluding China, with some duties being phased out over 10-year, 15-year and 20-year time frames, one of the Indian officials said.\n\nIndia\u2019s government plans to sell the deal as a political win because tariffs won\u2019t kick in for a decade, another Indian official said. But the administration still worries that local manufacturing will struggle when tariffs eventually drop and the country\u2019s poor, small-scale and low-tech farmers would struggle to compete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good political or geopolitical strategy for the Indian government to join the RCEP,\u201d said Ashwani Mahajan, co-convener of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a group aligned with Modi\u2019s party that commands influence among his base. \u201cThe RCEP is little more than a free-trade agreement with China, which will be disastrous for Indian businesses. We have spoken with the trade minister and made it clear that India should stay out of this deal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u201chighly likely\u201d the RCEP deal will be agreed to in Bangkok even if the agreement is not completely finalized, according to Juan Sebastian Cortes-Sanchez, a senior trade policy analyst at the Asian Trade Centre research group in Singapore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can expect a complete, crisp agreement, with all the tariff schedules and information, and all the chapters completed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we would expect them to sign something so that they can move forward with it.\u201d", "description": "Fearing intense competition for domestic firms, India is pushing for further concessions before the deal is announced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/16/b1823c469a5146a19f2dcf02933d758d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
