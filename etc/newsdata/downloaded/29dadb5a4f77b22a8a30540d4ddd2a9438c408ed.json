I\u2019ve had many middle-aged men say the same exact joke to me when serving their Cream of Chicken with Wild Rice: \u2018How do you tame wild rice?\u2019\u201d So says Reddit user Krisperrr, answering the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the \u2018It didn\u2019t scan, so it must be free hur hur hur\u2019 of your profession?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked a service job, you cringe in sympathy for Krisperrr, and how they must have to smile at this long-dead joke, a joke that may have been funny in some 1950s rom-com. You can imagine Krisperrr, a consummate professional, pretending to each boring old man that he has had an original thought. It\u2019s time for the old men to stop.\n\nHere are the jokes that Redditors have heard too many times. If you\u2019ve never heard them before, a lot of them will be funny! That\u2019s the thing about jokes. \u201cWhy did the chicken cross the road\u201d is an excellent joke, but if you expect anyone over the age of five to laugh at it, they will rightly assume that you have brain worms.\n\nTokenFroKid:\n\nI\u2019m obligated to ask those visiting my work place if they have any weapons to declare. \u201cJust these guns!\u201d flex\ufeff\n\nleazypeazy2:\n\nSelling lottery tickets. Im like what numbers would you like? Everyone be like \u201cthe winning ones.\u201d Bruh\ufeff\n\npurplebeeswax:\n\nI\u2019m in ultrasound. We do a hell of a lot more than just scanning pregnant people, but we get a lot of people who ask, \u201cIs it a boy or a girl? HAHAHA\u201d during abdominal and vascular studies.\ufeff\n\nThe-Shaffy:\n\nI work in the Deaf community and people always see the name of the charity I work for and say \u201cPardon?\u201d then laugh like they\u2019re the funniest person in the world.\ufeff\n\nGood lord.\n\nSee, this one from Redditor brogaant feels funny, but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have to hear it all day:\n\nVet tech here. Whenever I take a patient\u2019s temperature: \u201cAren\u2019t you going to at least buy her dinner first?\u201d\ufeff\n\nliteultom shows that even your topical jokes are old:\n\nBike messenger. Every year during the Tour De France: \u201cYou\u2019re lost buddy ?\u201d All f*cking day long.\ufeff\n\nBigDawgWol:\n\nTravel Money Bureau. Every time I\u2019m checking if some notes are legit or not, it\u2019s \u201cThey should be fine, I printed them this morning.\u201d Har de har har.\n\nGroovy_Chainsaw:\n\nMail carrier here. \u201cYou can keep the bills!\u201d hur hur hur\ufeff\n\nHere\u2019s a less-expected one from IT worker BrotherCool:\n\nWhen you\u2019re sitting at a user\u2019s desk and working on their PC, 99% of the time some arsehole co-worker will stop by and say, \u201cOh, (user who usually sits there)! You\u2019ve changed!\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cEvery day of my damn life,\u201d replies ShakCentral.\n\nit5th3m1ckster:\n\nStripper here. Our version is definitely: \u201cHow about I give YOU a lap dance!\u201d\ufeff\n\ndingleberry85:\n\nPsychologist. \u201cAre you analysing me now?\u201d The true answer is almost always, I am too apathetic about you to care that much.\n\nBack2Bach:\n\nAs a church musician, I\u2019ve heard things like, \u201cHow does it feel to have the largest organ in town?\u201d\ufeff\n\nPizza deliverers have it hard. sxmanderson says:\n\nIf you happen to pass by anyone else at all on your way to the customer, they will say \u201cYou can just leave that right here ha ha ha.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAnd that\u2019s the best case. Imagine being such a jerk that you\u2019d do this to ginger_whiskers:\n\nNever sure if this was supposed to be funny or just a really stupid scam, but... Used to deliver pizza. Almost every time I got an order for a public place, someone would jokingly try to claim it. But not just \u201cMy pizza! Lolnope who ya looking for?\u201d They\u2019d go through almost the entire transaction. Correct pizza, yep, I pull it out, they ask for cheese and peppers, that\u2019s $US21.64 ($32), they actually pull out a wallet, and then let me in on their \u201cjoke\u201d while my fingerprints were melting. Then they pile on asking if I have free samples in the car. I no longer work with the public.\ufeff\n\nNo wait, imagine being the kind of dick who made this \u201cjoke\u201d to 69schrutebucks:\n\nCake decorator here- people would come pick up their orders and jokingly tell me I spelled the name on the cake incorrectly. They would watch me get upset with myself and offer to fix it, then tell me they were just kidding.\ufeff\n\nReally has anyone ever thought for one second before opening their mouth? From WSWOP:\n\nI used to be in the beer industry (selling to supermarkets) and I\u2019d get \u201cyou can just load that pallet into my truck\u201d every day. Now I\u2019m in the elevator industry and about once a week I get \u201cI bet that has its ups and downs.\u201d\ufeff\n\nOK, not gonna lie, I feel like this one is actually good every time. From d16y8sohc:\n\nParamedic here, I ALWAYS get the old ladies saying \u201cOh! My taxi!\u201d Or \u201cYou coming back for me later?\u201d\ufeff\n\nAnd wowbaggerjules was on the wrong side of the exchange:\n\nI recently went through US Customs and the officer asked me the standard \u201cdo you have cash more than $US10,000 ($14,786) on you?\u201d question. I responded: \u201cI wish! HURHURHUR\u201d Her response: \u201cIf I had a penny for everyone who cracked that joke in front of me, I\u2019d have the $US10,000 ($14,786) by now.\u201d ...I totally deserved that.\ufeff\n\nSome dumb jokes cut across all service jobs. Every customer service agent, waitperson, or anyone who has to ask \u201cCan I get you anything else\u201d has heard all your corny answers. \u201cYeah, a thousand bucks!\u201d Oh you card! Every IT pro, Apple Genius, and repair worker has heard \u201cGuess I get a new one!\u201d Everyone who ever rang up a purchase has heard \u201cGuess it\u2019s free!\u201d\n\nEven CreativeUsernameUser, a teacher, hears \u201cOh, you can\u2019t find my paper, must mean I get a 100% on it.\u201d At least that one\u2019s coming from actual children.\n\nNext time you\u2019re about to deliver a witticism to someone who\u2019s doing their job\u2014or make a joke about their name, or about their physical appearance or something else they can\u2019t control\u2014ask yourself two things:\n\nIs it conceivable that someone has made this joke before? If this person doesn\u2019t like your joke, are they at all socially obligated to pretend they did?\n\nIf the answer to either is yes, do not make that joke!\n\nIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re not allowed to be funny. It\u2019s wonderful to be funny! It\u2019s not wonderful to tell a worn-out joke to someone who can\u2019t give an honest reaction. That\u2019s tedious and a little bullying, and even if they don\u2019t admit it, it makes them like you less. Don\u2019t whine about it. Get some new material.\n\nIf you hear the same joke over and over at your job, you probably have a silent retort. A lot of redditors shared theirs. For example, a doctor complained about patients who answer \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d with \u201cYou tell me, you\u2019re the doctor!\u201d User1539 suggested this: \u201cWell first off, you\u2019re insufferable.\u201d The Reddit thread has more retorts you can\u2019t say out loud, and some you can.\n\nKrisperrr has their own answer about taming wild rice: \u201cWith a very small saddle!\u201d\n\nQuotes have been edited for clarity.", "description": "\u201cI serve banquets.
