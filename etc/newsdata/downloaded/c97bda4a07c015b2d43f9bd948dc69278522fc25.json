But China has also prioritized tracking the movements of ethnic Uighurs, a minority mostly Muslim group considered a security threat by Beijing.\n\nChina is facing growing international criticism over its treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Members of the group have been subject to mass detentions in what China calls \u201cvocational training\u201d centers and widespread state surveillance.\n\nBeijing\u2019s alleged cyberspace attacks against Uighurs show how it is able to pursue those policies beyond its physical borders.\n\nAs part of the campaign, different groups of Chinese hackers have compromised telecoms operators in countries including Turkey, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand and Malaysia, the four sources said.\n\nThose countries are frequently used as transit routes by Uighurs to travel between Xinjiang and Turkey in what human rights activists say is an attempt to escape state persecution.\n\nBeijing has said that such travelers may be going to fight for militant groups in Iraq and Syria, with Chinese officials saying that the measures in Xinjiang are needed to stem the threat of Islamist extremism.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied involvement in cyber attacks or any mistreatment of the Uighur people, whose religious and cultural rights Beijing says are fully protected, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry said any hacking allegations need to be supported by evidence.\n\n\u201cWe would again like to stress that China is a resolute safeguarder of internet security. We consistently and resolutely oppose and crack down on any forms of internet attacks,\u201d a ministry statement said.\n\nReuters was not able to identify which specific telecoms operators were compromised. Government officials in India and Thailand declined to comment. Authorities in Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Turkey did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. cybersecurity company Volexity this week published a report detailing what it said were Chinese efforts to hack the phones and email accounts of Uighurs around the world.\n\nResearchers at Google also said they had discovered a campaign by unknown parties to infect thousands of Apple iPhones, which sources told Forbes and TechCrunch was targeted at the Uighur community.\n\n\u2018WINDOW INTO SOMEONE\u2019S LIFE\u2019\n\nTelecoms operators have long been targeted by intelligence agencies around the world for the wealth of sensitive user data they hold, such as information on location and contacts.\n\nWestern officials say Chinese cyber attacks have in part been driven by concerns that some of the up to 5,000 Uighurs believed to be fighting alongside militant groups in Iraq and Syria may return to carry out attacks in China.\n\nThe ability to access telecoms user data has also become an increasingly valuable spying resource as the widespread use of encrypted messaging platforms has made it harder to intercept and monitor communications, said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at U.S. cybersecurity company FireEye.\n\n\u201cA single (telecoms operator) intrusion gives attackers access to a lot more information than they would get going after individuals,\u201d he said.\n\nFireEye said that one of the Chinese hacking groups it monitors had deployed a piece of malware against telecoms operators in Southeast Asia to mine SMS data for messages containing keywords associated with terror attacks, military ranks and names of Chinese politicians.\n\nThe Chinese hackers also widely targeted call detail record (CDR) data held by their victims, said Amit Serper, an investigator at U.S.-Israeli cybersecurity company Cybereason, which published a report on the activity this year.\n\nCDR data shows who is sending and receiving calls, as well as the user\u2019s location, giving an attacker what Serper described as \u201ca window into someone\u2019s life\u201d.\n\nStealing a user\u2019s CDR data \u201cgives you the ability to see who this person is contacting and, most importantly, which cell tower their phone is connecting to all day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo not only can you map someone\u2019s circle of friends, you can map someone\u2019s entire day.\u201d", "description": "Hackers working for the Chinese government have broken into telecoms networks to track Uighur travelers in Central and Southeast Asia, two intelligence officials and two security consultants who investigated the attacks told Reuters.", "authors": ["Jack Stubbs", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
