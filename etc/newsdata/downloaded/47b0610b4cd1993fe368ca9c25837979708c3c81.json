That is exactly counter to the purpose of the team. We have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs.\u201d\n\nSalazar was banned last week for possessing and trafficking testosterone while coaching top runners at the Nike Oregon Project, an elite training program bankrolled by the company that was launched in 2001.\n\nSalazar is appealing against the decision.\n\nNike says \u201cwe will help all of our athletes in this transition as they choose the coaching set up that is right for them.
