What we did not know in 2016, but do now, is how perilous crashing out with no-deal would be.\n\nYet no matter how unlikely it may seem, there is still no guarantee that won\u2019t happen on Thursday.\n\nIt is why Jeremy Corbyn is right to resist a General Election until stopping that outcome is absolutely watertight.\n\nIf Boris Johnson could be trusted, we might take his word he wants a deal. But he can\u2019t so we daren\u2019t.\n\nWe are all heartily sick of Brexit but we must not capitulate through exhaustion.\n\nIt would be like saying in 1944 we couldn\u2019t be bothered with D-Day.\n\nBecause World War Two was getting tiresome.\n\nMillions more needed for vital fund\n\nThe Sunday Mirror is the newspaper which champions mental health awareness.\n\nSo we are fully behind Suicide Prevention minister Nadine Dorries in her \u00a31million drive to help the bereaved when loved ones kill themselves.\n\nNumbers are climbing, and with nearly one in 10 of those touched by suicide going on to make an attempt on their own life, this initiative comes none to soon.\n\nThe ripples of such tragedies spread out over a pool of despair that needs specialist treatment.\n\nAnd as someone who has suffered the agony of her childhood soulmate taking his own life, Ms Dorries knows what she is talking about.\n\nBut \u00a31million seems a small sum. So we hope Ms Dorries gets all the funding she needs to ensure this project is a success.\n\nThe cost of bringing comfort to the traumatised should have no price.\n\nBond is PC but not quite XR\n\nJames Bond is going politically correct, thanks to the input of Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\nIn the next movie, his new wife insists on keeping her maiden name.\n\nWhatever next? 007 being greeted at an Extinction Rebellion protest: \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you, Mr Bond.\u201d", "description": "Gina Miller's death threats are outrageous, but so is the thought of a no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20731258.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Pink-News-Awards-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
