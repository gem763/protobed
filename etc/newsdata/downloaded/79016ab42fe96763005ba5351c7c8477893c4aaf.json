Literally.\n\nLee captured his new action thriller in 120 frames-per-second 4K 3D in order to bridge the uncanny valley between Will Smith and his costar, a clone played by a \u201cyoung,\u201d completely digital version of Smith. The director, who previously pushed the limitations of cinematic visuals in films like Billy Lynn\u2019s Halftime Walk and Life of Pi (which won him a second directing Oscar), intends for \u201cHFR\u201d projection to make the the unrealistic look hyper-realistic.\n\nExcept most people won\u2019t see the fruit of Lee\u2019s labor when the movie bows this Friday; Polygon confirmed with representatives from Paramount Pictures and Dolby Cinema that only 14 U.S. theaters will project Will Smith\u2019s new action thriller in 120 fps 3D.\n\nAt the time of publication, Paramount was unable to supply Polygon with a full list of theaters playing the film at Lee\u2019s intended specifications, though a rep said that nearly all HFR 3D screenings, including IMAX, would run at 60 fps. A Dolby Cinema representative provided Polygon with a list of the 14 American theaters supplied with the company\u2019s proprietary technology that will run Gemini Man at the full frame rate \u2014 but only at 2K, not 4K. Dolby notes that several Odeon theaters outfitted with Dolby 3D in the U.K. will also project 120 fps.\n\n(Oddly enough, when Gemini Man premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles earlier this month, Paramount tricked the venue out with a CINITY Cinema System that projected the film at the maximum frame rate and resolution. Only a few theaters in Asia are expected to replicate the experience.)\n\nSo despite shooting the movie 120 fps 4K 3D, no theater in America will technically play the film as Lee intended. But some will come close. Here\u2019s the full list of the Dolby-equipped U.S. theaters playing 120 fps 2K 3D:\n\nAMC Aventura Mall 24 \u2013 Miami, FL\n\nAMC Century City 15 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA\n\nAMC Del Amo 18 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA\n\nAMC Disney Springs 24 \u2013 Orlando, FL\n\nAMC Elmwood Palace 20 \u2013 New Orleans, LA\n\nAMC Flatiron Crossing 14 \u2013 Denver, CO\n\nAMC Hawthorn 12 \u2013 Chicago, IL\n\nAMC Lincoln Square 13 \u2013 New York, NY\n\nAMC Metreon 16 \u2013 San Francisco, CA\n\nAMC North Point 12 \u2013 Atlanta, GA\n\nAMC River East 21 \u2013 Chicago, IL\n\nAMC Town Square 18 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV\n\nAMC White Marsh 16 \u2013 Baltimore, MD\n\nAMC Willowbrook 24 \u2013 Houston, TX\n\nLee told Polygon after a screening of Gemini Man that 120 fps 2K 3D felt like the necessary avenue to make \u201cJunior,\u201d Smith\u2019s digital avatar, a soulful character who could also appear to beat the living crap out of a real actor in the film\u2019s many fight sequences. He also knew going in that the format would not be accessible for many viewers because of location, time, or the sour taste left by previous HFR screenings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair. People will be intimated by 3D and more data and more details,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt can be scary and most people won\u2019t try it. But it also [gave] us more material to work with. We had 40 times more data, which meant 40 times more chance of flopping or succeeding. You just have more to work with, and in 3D, it\u2019s sharper. Because of that, it made me want to do this. You can\u2019t put on makeup or erase wrinkles or have his son play him and call that a clone.\u201d\n\nThe gravitational pull of Netflix and the pristine viewing of home theater experiences is real. But Lee hopes some people will find Gemini Man and vindicate his experiment. \u201cThe scary part is that the TV is ahead of movies,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] I would like to show them it the right way.\u201d", "description": "Few Americans will see the new Will Smith movie as director Ang Lee intended. The high frame rate and 3D is supposed to help a digital young Will Smith come to life. But most movie theaters in the U.S. aren\u2019t equipped to even play the movie that way.", "authors": ["Matt Patches", "Ryan Gilliam", "Nicole Carpenter", "Austen Goslin", "Julia Lee", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v2MvYlLvtgkIYOoEh3Oa9lzV0UA=/0x0:2200x1152/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19267722/gmff013k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
