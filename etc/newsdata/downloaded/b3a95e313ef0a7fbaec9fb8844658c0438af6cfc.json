The median estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 1.5% contraction. Output increased 0.4% in the month.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nThe drop in output is a bad third-quarter start for an economy that managed to dodge a second recession in consecutive years after it expanded an annualised 3.1% in the three months through June.\n\nManufacturing accounts for about 14% of gross domestic product and output is very sensitive to power-supply constraints. While Eskom hasn\u2019t implemented load shedding since the first quarter, a member of the utility\u2019s board, Nelisiwe Magubane, has warned that an uptick in economic growth could lead to a new round of power cuts as the power utility won\u2019t be able to respond to an increase in demand for electricity.\n\n- With assistance from Simbarashe Gumbo and Renee Bonorchis.", "description": "Manufacturing production declined 1.1% from a year earlier, compared with a revised 3.6% fall in June, according to Stats SA.", "authors": ["Prinesha Naidoo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8135/63d1ecebae544fee930b4e2703fd8ab7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
