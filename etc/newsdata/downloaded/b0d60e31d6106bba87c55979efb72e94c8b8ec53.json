I had to hold him whilst he was put under and it was really hard to watch.\n\n'Hannah and I cried and prayed the whole time Barney was in surgery.'\n\nThe baby had been diagnosed with septic arthritis of the hip, which had been caused by a common cold which developed into an infection.\n\nWhen Barney, now 11 months old, first had a temperature and endured restless nights, the Lynches assumed it was the symptoms of teething experienced by all babies.\n\nBut they consulted a GP friend, who also dismissed it as a tummy bug.\n\nMr Lynch said: 'Barney had been acting a bit off a few days prior to him going to hospital and when we asked a friend of ours who's a GP, they said it sounded like he had a bit of a tummy bug.\n\nProject manager Thom Lynch, 29, said he will never forget the 'worst moment of their lives' having to hold their son down as he was put to sleep\n\nTwo months on from the ordeal, Barney has been doing well and appears to be reaching all of his milestones as expected such as crawling, eating well and chatting\n\n'Initially we thought Barney was just teething. He was really whingey and had a slight temperature, as well as being off his food and not sleeping very well - all things often associated with teething.\n\n'But when Barney started to get pains in the top of his legs and midriff, as well as a high temperature, we were advised to take him to hospital as soon as possible.\n\n'We thought we would just be getting some medication or something for Barney - Hannah and I never expected he'd be rushed into surgery.'\n\nFollowing blood tests and an X-Ray, the Lynches were told Barney had septic arthritis caused by an infection spreading through his body and ending up in the joints around his hip bone.\n\nBarney had to spend a couple of weeks in Norfolk and Norwich university hospital where he received antibiotics\n\nTwo months on from his operation, Barney has been doing well and appears to be reaching all of his milestones as expected such as crawling, eating well and chatting\n\nIn a successful bid to drain the infection, Barney was taken into surgery.\n\nYet he needed a second operation after doctors found several other 'pockets' of the infection had spread throughout his body.\n\nWHAT IS SEPTIC ARTHRITIS? Septic arthritis is the inflammation of a joint caused by a bacterial infection. Bacteria often enters the bloodstream via a wound, but in Barney's case it was picked up through a common cold. Any joint can be affected by the condition, but it mainly occurs in knees and hips. Most people make a full recovery after treatment, but if it is left untreated septic arthritis can cause permanent joint damage and can be life-threatening. The symptoms of septic arthritis includes severe pain, swelling, redness, a temperature and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved \u2013 for example, during nappy changing. They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints.
