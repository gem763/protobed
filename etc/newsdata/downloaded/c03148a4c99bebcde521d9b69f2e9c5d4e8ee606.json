Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump should be impeached. Not just for his manipulation of Ukraine, but for his overwhelming pattern of treachery against the United States.\n\nThe president swears that his pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s leading opponent in the 2020 election, was perfectly innocent. Despite an array of evidence that Trump abused power\u2014a whistleblower complaint, an arm-twisting phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, suspension of U.S. military aid to increase the heat, and an influence campaign in Ukraine by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani\u2014Trump shrugs off the whole story as a \u201cUkraine Witch Hunt.\u201d He says he\u2019ll beat the rap.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s rap sheet is a lot longer than one story. What he has done in Ukraine\u2014defending a corrupt foreign official, enlisting a foreign government to fight his domestic political opponents, and circumventing or removing American security officials who stood in his way\u2014is part of a pattern. In transactions with at least seven countries, Trump has pursued personal advantage at the expense of the United States. In each case, he has explicitly attacked America, its political leaders, or its national security officials.\n\nHere are the seven countries.\n\n1. Russia. Trump solicited criminal campaign help from Russia and defended collaboration with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. These aren\u2019t unproven allegations. They\u2019re recorded on video. At a press conference in July 2016, Trump urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. When a reporter asked Trump whether he had \u201cany pause about asking a foreign government\u2014Russia, China, anybody\u2014to interfere, to hack \u2026 anybody in this country,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, it gives me no pause.\u201d In 2017, when he was asked about the Trump Tower meeting at which his top campaign officials sought political help from Russian emissaries, Trump said there was no difference between getting help from Russians and getting it from Americans.\n\nTrump views competition with other countries as a venue in which to outscore and humiliate the real enemy: his fellow American politicians.\n\nTrump has repeatedly asserted that the United States is no better than Russia. During his campaign, and again as president, he defended Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s record of killing dissidents, claiming that \u201cour country does plenty of killing also\u201d and isn\u2019t \u201cso innocent.\u201d Trump said Putin was better than President Barack Obama, calling the Russian president \u201ca leader, you know, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d Last month, at a press conference, Trump boasted five times that Putin had \u201coutsmarted\u201d Obama.\n\nTrump took specific steps to protect Putin from the U.S. government. He repeatedly defended Putin against the 2017 U.S. intelligence report that exposed Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump also dismissed the American officials behind the report as liars and hacks. He denounced the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and \u201cthe intelligence community.\u201d Last year, after a Department of Justice indictment documented the involvement of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the election hacks, Trump dismissed the evidence and defended Putin\u2019s denial.\n\n2. North Korea. Last year, Trump formed a public-relations alliance with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, based on the mutually advantageous fiction that North Korea was dismantling or halting its nuclear missile program. Since then, Trump has followed Kim\u2019s lead, ridiculing American officials and politicians Kim doesn\u2019t like. In May, Trump repeatedly applauded North Korea for calling Biden a \u201cfool of low IQ.\u201d In June, Trump portrayed the United States as North Korea\u2019s lowly suitor, boasting\u2014falsely\u2014that Obama had \u201ccalled Kim Jong-un on numerous occasions to meet\u201d and that despite \u201cbegging for meetings constantly,\u201d Obama had been turned down. Trump has also endorsed Kim\u2019s attacks on Trump\u2019s own advisers. Two weeks ago, after North Korea denounced U.S. national security adviser John Bolton as a \u201chuman defect\u201d and said Bolton should vanish, Trump fired Bolton and defended North Korea\u2019s invective against him.\n\nKim, like Putin, enjoys Trump\u2019s protection from U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump has brushed aside the agencies\u2019 evidence of Kim\u2019s ongoing nuclear and missile work, calling such allegations \u201cfake news\u201d from \u201cthe Opposition Party.\u201d Last month, Trump again followed Kim\u2019s lead, criticizing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. And on Monday, despite international alarm over North Korea\u2019s persistent missile launches, the president defended them.\n\n3. Saudi Arabia. Trump is shielding the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, from American intelligence that shows MBS directed the murder of a U.S. resident, journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Last fall, a CIA assessment concluded that MBS ordered the assassination. Trump lied about the assessment, claiming that the CIA \u201cdidn\u2019t make a determination.\u201d Congress then instructed Trump to issue a legally mandated report on Khashoggi\u2019s death, but Trump refused. Three months ago, when Trump was asked whether the FBI should look into the case, he said it had been sufficiently investigated, and he claimed that \u201cnobody so far has pointed directly a finger\u201d at MBS. When a reporter pointed out that the CIA had in fact implicated MBS, Trump replied, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to talk about intelligence.\u201d\n\n4. China. Trump often complains about China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States. But he always insists that the real culprit is the U.S. government. That\u2019s because Trump views competition with other countries, like collaboration with other countries, as a venue in which to outscore and humiliate the real enemy: his fellow American politicians. At least 19 times since Trump became president, he has declared, \u201cI don\u2019t blame China.\u201d Instead, he has faulted America. Last fall, he explained, \u201cI don\u2019t blame China. I blame our country.\u201d Last year, and again two months ago, he repeated, \u201cI don\u2019t blame China. I blame the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s contempt for America, relative to China, goes beyond trade policy. He also believes that China\u2019s Communist government is morally superior to the Democratic Party of the United States. Earlier this year, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer refused to fund Trump\u2019s border wall, Trump protested, \u201cI find China, frankly, in many ways, to be far more honorable than Cryin\u2019 Chuck and Nancy. I really do. I think that China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.\u201d\n\n5. Israel. This year, Trump has targeted four Democratic congresswomen: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. He has portrayed them as un-American, claiming that they \u201ccame from countries\u201d with bad governments (three of them were born here) and should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d But it\u2019s Trump, not the congresswomen, who has dragged a foreign government into the feud.\n\nLast month, Omar and Tlaib made plans to travel to Israel. Although Israel objected to their support of boycotts against it, it decided to permit their visit, on the grounds that denying entry to members of Congress would be an offense against the United States. But Trump felt no such loyalty to his country. He openly urged Israel to bar the two Americans\u2014in fact, he warned Israel that it would look weak if it approved their trip\u2014and he also lobbied Israeli officials in private. Under his pressure, Israel reversed itself and blocked the visit.\n\nTrump proceeded to exploit Israel\u2019s rebuke of the two congresswomen, just as he had exploited Putin\u2019s criticisms of Clinton and North Korea\u2019s criticisms of Biden. He also suggested that American Jews should put allegiance to Israel before their duties as American citizens. \u201cAny Jewish people that vote for a Democrat,\u201d he argued, were \u201cbeing very disloyal to Israel.\u201d\n\n6. Turkey. Trump has consistently excused Turkish aggression against the United States. In 2017, he defended his former national security adviser Michael Flynn after Flynn was exposed as a Turkish foreign agent who had spiked a U.S. plan to arm America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Then Trump refused to criticize Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2014and even expressed sympathy to Erdogan in a phone call\u2014after Erdogan\u2019s thugs assaulted protesters in Washington. Last year, the White House pressed the Justice Department to look for ways to expel Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish dissident, despite having been told there were no legal grounds to do so. And in a dispute over whether to betray the Kurds in Syria, Trump sided with Erdogan against U.S. officials. Trump capped his treachery by firing Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had protested his abandonment of the Kurds.\n\n7. Ukraine. What we know so far about Trump\u2019s backstage manipulation of Ukraine fits the pattern. But you can also see several of his pathologies out in the open.\n\nOne of them is his incomprehension that he\u2019s supposed to be a teammate, not an enemy, of previous American presidents. At last month\u2019s G-7 meeting, Trump dismissed Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian province, as a personal embarrassment to Obama. That invasion was Obama\u2019s problem, not Trump\u2019s, the president argued. Therefore, in Trump\u2019s view, the punishment Russia had suffered for it\u2014being kicked out of what was then the G-8\u2014should be overturned, now that Trump was president. Crimea was \u201ctaken away from President Obama, not taken away from President Trump,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out \u2026 that was his determination.\u201d\n\nAnother pathology, familiar from Trump\u2019s interactions with Russia, China, and North Korea, is his habit of belittling domestic critics by playing on the idea of American inferiority. \u201cOur media has become the laughingstock of the world,\u201d the president told reporters on Friday, castigating them\u2014in the presence of Australia\u2019s prime minister\u2014for pursuing the Ukraine story. \u201cThe media of our country is laughed at all over the world now. You\u2019re a joke.\u201d On Tuesday, at a meeting with Iraq\u2019s president, Trump claimed that every foreign head of state with whom he had spoken at the U.N. General Assembly said the investigations of him were \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nA third pattern, consistent with Trump\u2019s treatment of Russia, North Korea, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, is his attacks on U.S. intelligence officials. On Saturday, he tweeted smears by two Fox News commentators. One called the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s complaint a \u201cseditious effort\u201d against Trump. The other warned that \u201can American spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president.\u201d\n\nTrump says Ukraine is part of a much bigger story. \u201cIt\u2019s just a continuation of the witch hunt,\u201d he scoffed on Tuesday. He\u2019s right that we\u2019re seeing the same thing over and over. But what we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t witches. It\u2019s a president betraying his country.
