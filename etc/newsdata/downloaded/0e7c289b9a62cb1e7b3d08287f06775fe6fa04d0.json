This has been an issue as unemployment has continued to fall and in September dipped to a half-century low of 3.5%.\n\nA number of districts reported that manufacturers had reduced employment because of softness in new orders although some firms were more concerned about the longer-term availability of workers and opted to trim hours rather than laying off employees.\n\nEven with the tight labor markets, wages were described as rising only moderately but some upward pressure was noted for lower-skilled workers in the retail and hospitality industries and for higher-skilled professional and technical workers.\n\nA number of smaller firms reported difficulty matching pay offers from larger firms and many employers were continuing to use non-wage incentives such as increased bonuses and benefits to attract and retain workers.\n\nPrice increases were described as modest but both retailers and manufacturers noted rising input costs, often for items that had been hit with new tariffs in the trade war. The report said that retailers were finding more success in passing on the price increases to their customers than U.S. manufacturers were finding.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced last Friday a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade battle, saying he had agreed to suspend a tariff hike scheduled to go into effect this week on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Trump said that the Chinese had agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.\n\nWhile the cease-fire lifted spirts on Wall Street much more work will be needed to achieve a final deal. Investors have cited this lingering trade uncertainty as a main reason they believe the Fed will feel the need to cut rates again later this month.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. economy was expanding at a modest pace in September and into October despite the fact manufacturing was being hurt by rising", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/253862_beige-book-01228-in-31-2019-file-photo-workers-clean-facade-state-farm-stadium-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
