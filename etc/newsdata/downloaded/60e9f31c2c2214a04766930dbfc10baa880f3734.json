Houston's 2-0 lead after three innings proved to be all they needed to take Game 3.\n\n\"I just liked the competitiveness of our at-bats,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said in a postgame interview. \"We were kind of pretty focused on handing the baton to the next guy, which is really important. \"We're at our best when we do that.\"\n\nThe Nationals got on the board in the bottom of the fourth inning on a triple by center fielder Victor Robles, scoring first baseman Ryan Zimmerman who had opened the frame with a walk, making the score 2-1.\n\nThe Astros responded with a run in the fifth inning after Jos\u00e9 Altuve doubled and Brantley singled for his second RBI, extending their lead to 3-1.\n\nThe Nats had chances to score, stranding eight runners over the first five innings, and 12 overall.\n\nHouston chased Nats' starter S\u00e1nchez in the top of the sixth after he gave up a homer to catcher Robinson Chirinos and then walked pinch hitter Kyle Tucker. The homer made the score 4-1.\n\nHere's what made this a must-win game for Houston: no team in the history of the Fall Classic has ever come back to win after losing the first three games. The Astros made sure they would not be in that position.\n\nGame 3 was the first World Series game played in the nation's capital since 1933.\n\nGame 4 in Washington will feature Nationals lefty Patrick Corbin against the Astros' rookie Jose Urquidy.", "description": "Houston got on the board first and led throughout the game as Washington stranded 12 runners.
