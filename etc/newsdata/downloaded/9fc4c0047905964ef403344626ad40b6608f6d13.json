This new policy will prohibit ads selling treatments that have no established biomedical or scientific basis. The new policy also includes treatments that are rooted in basic scientific findings and preliminary clinical experience, but currently have insufficient formal clinical testing to justify widespread clinical use.\u201d Google\u2019s statement posted by Adrienne Biddings, Policy Adviser\n\nThese \u201cbad actors\" can take advantage of and offer untested, deceptive treatments to individuals who are often sick and desperate, looking for miracle cures.\n\nAbusers in the industry have been documented, such as the company, U.S. Stem Cell, which was challenged in court by the FDA and lost its case after at least four patients were blinded after the company and its clinics performed stem cell eye treatments.\n\nThe stem cell industry has seen little regulation in recent years. Unproven and untested treatments are often used in clinics that serve numerous clients because \u201cthese clinics operate mostly in the private health care sector and typically market their interventions directly to patients over the internet,\u201d according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, Google pulled in approximately $116.3 billion in ad revenue through its Google Ads platform. So far, it is unclear how much money Google will lose from halting these types of stem cell advertisements on its site.\n\n\u201cDigital advertising helps fuel an open internet for people all over the world,\u201d Biddings wrote in the statement. \u201cWe know the digital ads ecosystem can only flourish if it\u2019s a place that is safe and trustworthy for users.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe ban will take effect in October and will impact Google\u2019s ad services, including YouTube and ads Google places on third-party websites.", "description": "Stem cells could be a miracle cure or a scam -- Google stops advertising unproven stem cell treatments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19249633396987.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
