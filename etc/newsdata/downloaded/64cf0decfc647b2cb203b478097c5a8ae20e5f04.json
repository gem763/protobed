Let us decide in a people\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has been campaigning for a Final Say referendum since 2018 and has secured backing from more than 1.3 million people.\n\nThe prime minister is trying to push his Brexit deal through parliament by the 31 October deadline.\n\nHowever crowds in Parliament Square on Saturday cheered as MPs backed a rebel amendment by Sir Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of Mr Johnson\u2019s plan until the full Brexit legislation has passed.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night the prime minister was served another humiliating Commons defeat as MPs voted by 322 to 308 to reject his plan to push legislation approving his Brexit deal through the Commons in just three days.\n\nThe prime minister told MPs he would now \u201cpause\u201d the Withdrawal Agreement Bill until the EU takes a decision on whether to grant another Brexit delay.\n\nBut the vote appears to have scuppered his hopes of leaving with a deal in just nine days\u2019 time.\n\nThe Final Say letter will be delivered simultaneously to Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament before 31 October, as well as the EU Parliament and the building in Brussels where the EU council meets.\n\nMPs will individually be sent a list of signatories from their constituencies.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
