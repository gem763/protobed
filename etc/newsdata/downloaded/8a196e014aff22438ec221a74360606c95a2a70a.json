REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, or SAMA, contacted Saudi banks last week, asking them a series of questions about their lending exposure to Aramco, two of the sources said.\n\nSaudi investors are expected to be large buyers of Aramco shares, partly because of a \u201cpatriotic\u201d push to own a piece of the kingdom\u2019s crown jewels after an attack on oil facilities last month crippled Saudi crude production and exposed the country\u2019s defense vulnerabilities.\n\nSAMA is checking whether local banks have the capacity to handle demand for loans linked to the IPO, one of the sources said. Up to 6-7 million local investors are expected to participate in the listing, he added, but it is not clear how many of them will use credit to finance their share purchases.\n\nThe authority is assessing \u201crisk weighting and wants to ensure there will be no (regulatory) breaches\u201d, a second source said.\n\nThe source said SAMA\u2019s questions - via telephone and email - were around how banks classify their exposure to Aramco, including its subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cAramco has so much ownership in so many entities ... it\u2019s hard to say how much exposure it comes to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe world\u2019s most profitable company, Aramco dominates the local economy with over a dozen domestic subsidiaries in addition to partial ownership in joint ventures including power generation companies and large petrochemical firms such as Petro Rabigh 2380.SE.\n\nSaudi banks have been under pressure in the past few years from a slowdown in the construction and retail sectors, but \u201cfunding and liquidity remained sound, with deposit and loan growth roughly in line, and capital ratios solid\u201d, Fitch rating agency said this summer.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s governor, Ahmed al-Kholifey, said last month that he did not expect the IPO to affect liquidity in the Saudi banking sector, but that SAMA may revise its lending regulations to facilitate availability of liquidity to investors before the IPO.\n\nSAMA and Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPRESSING AHEAD\n\nSaudi Arabia is pressing ahead with plans to sell between 1% and 2% of its oil company, the world\u2019s largest, through a local listing, which might be followed by additional share sales locally and internationally.\n\nAramco has approached wealthy Saudi families in recent weeks as part of wider efforts to build a large investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources previously told Reuters.\n\nThe local listing \u2013 crucial to Prince Mohammed\u2019s plans to wean the Saudi economy off its oil dependence \u2013 could raise more than $20 billion in its initial phase.\n\nAramco has been meeting analysts over the past few weeks to market the company ahead of the listing. Analysts\u2019 reports are expected to be released on Oct. 20.\n\nThe company\u2019s main advisers last week started pre-IPO meetings with potential investors in the United States, Europe and Asia, to gauge demand for the deal, two sources said.\n\nAn IPO prospectus in Arabic could be released to investors on Oct. 25 and an English one for the wider market on Oct. 27, the sources said.\n\nThis week, Fitch downgraded Aramco by one notch to an \u2018A\u2019 credit rating, citing last month\u2019s attacks and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.\n\nRiyadh has blamed adversary Iran for the attacks, a charge Tehran denies.\n\nAramco\u2019s bonds fell after the rating announcement, which was widely expected as it followed a similar downgrade of the sovereign on Sept. 30.", "description": "The Saudi central bank is vetting local lenders' exposure to Saudi Aramco ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) of the state-oil giant that will likely see large numbers of Saudi investors seek loans to buy its stock, three sources familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438438975&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970TT", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
