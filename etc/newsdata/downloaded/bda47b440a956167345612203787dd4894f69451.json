However, little did he know that Tubbs (Tayla Kovacevic-Ebong) had filmed him illegally acquiring a car for Kheerat (Jaz Deol) \u2014 something which Ben has been using as leverage into order to get Martin to do his dirty work.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s episode, viewers saw Martin head off on his first pick-up on Ben\u2019s behalf, but when he realised that the elderly woman was unable to pay up, Martin decided to used the takings from the stall to in order to pay off her debt \u2014 and Ben remained none-the-wiser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in tonight\u2019s episode, Ian (Adam Woodyatt) proceeded to asked Martin for Monday\u2019s takings \u2014 and it didn\u2019t long for the truth to come to light, as Ben figured out what Martin had done. Fuming, he berated Martin for not carrying out the task required of him, and told him he needs to toughen up.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Martin later found out that his services were required for yet another pick-up and that this time, Tubbs would be accompanying him. It\u2019s safe to say that this one didn\u2019t exactly go as planned either, as \u2014 during said pick-up \u2014 two men arrived and got in his way. With his rage building, Martin violently punched the pair of them.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t stop at just one punch, as he proceeded to punch the guy repeatedly, before storming off down the market \u2014 rage and emotion apparent in his eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that working with Ben is certainly taking its toll on Martin \u2014 but will there be repercussions for his actions?\n\nBen did tell him to toughen up, so perhaps he\u2019ll be chuffed with Martin\u2019s angrier approach? Tubbs\u2019 positive reaction to Martin\u2019s mean streak would certainly seem to indicate that this will be the case.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, how\u2019s Martin going to explain his injuries to Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) or Bex?\n\nEastEnders continues on Friday 18th October at 8:30pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A dark new storyline is revealed for Ben Mitchell as he takes revenge\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler in serious danger \u2014 but will he die?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After weeks of being put under pressure, Martin finally snapped ad released his pent up anger and aggression in violent scenes.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Martin-Fowler-in-EastEnders-27b1_1571339081.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
