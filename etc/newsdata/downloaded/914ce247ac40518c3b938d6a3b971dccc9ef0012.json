You can form your own view.

Some of it, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cActually it was more than racism. I thought it was personal \u2013 attacking someone you don\u2019t know, attacking her.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Peter Lindbergh's best Vogue covers Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Peter Lindbergh's best Vogue covers 1/10 November 1988, American Vogue Anna Wintour's first cover for American Vogue was era-defining in more ways than one. Namely because Wintour subverted a decade-long tradition of only putting elaborate occasionwear on magazine covers. Instead, she chose a beaded Christian Lacroix jacket and stone-wash Guess jeans. The smiley photograph that Lindbergh captured of Israeli model Michaela Bercu lends itself to a similarly unvarnished aesthetic, one that soon became Lindbergh's trademark. Vogue 2/10 September 1990, British Vogue This cover marks a rare moment for Lindbergh, given that its star is not a supermodel. Now an established jewellery designer, Jade Jagger is perhaps best known for being the daughter of Rolling Stones front man, Mick Jagger. She was just 19 years old at the time of this shoot and had just left boarding school in Wiltshire. Here, Lindbergh shot her unusually close-up, erasing the outline of her face to produce a truly unique image. Vogue 3/10 January 1990, British Vogue Ask any Vogue fan which is their favourite cover of all time, and most will name this one. Lindbergh famously photographed Naomi, Linda, Tatjana, Christy and Cindy at the height of their fame. What's more, he allowed their beauty to stand on its own, eschewing glittering gowns and garish makeup for jeans, stretchy tops and bare faces. Vogue 4/10 March 1990, British Vogue If anyone can put a horse on the cover of British Vogue without making it look like an equestrian catalogue, it's Lindbergh. For this special international collections issue, he photographed Danish supermodel Helena Christensen with a majestic horse whose coat matched the optic whiteness of her column dress by Giorgio di Sant'Angelo. Vogue 5/10 September 1992, British Vogue In a somewhat grungier cover than is usual for Lindbergh, Linda Evangelista poses as a tattooed, chain-laden New York City taxi driver. Vogue 6/10 October 2016, Vogue Italy In this cover, Lindbergh returned to his one of favoured aesthetics: sepia. Film met fashion in this snap - one of the three covers chosen for the issue - with Isabeli Fontana, Carolyn Murphy and Milla Jovovich captured strolling down the street in New York City's Times Square wearing androgynous ensembles by Gucci. \u201cI wanted to tell a story on the street,\" Lindbergh said of his concept. \"And while often in magazines the act of walking is portrayed in a stereotyped and frankly boring way, this is where looking to the future is for me.\" Vogue 7/10 January 2019, Vogue Japan Tilda Swinton looks almost unrecognisable in this Vogue Japan cover, sporting a black bob and an embellished blue jacket from Chanel's Haute Couture collection. With this cover, Lindbergh showed he can reinvent even one of the most famous actors with his imagery. Vogue 8/10 April 2018, Vogue Australia Emma Watson was chosen as the guest editor for this issue of the Australian fashion publication, which was focused on tackling issues related to global warming. The British actor was photographed by Lindbergh for the cover in a ruffled black gown with her hair blowing in the wind. \"Thank you, Peter Lindbergh,\" Watson wrote in her editor's letter, praising the artist's \"careful eye\". Vogue 9/10 July 2019, Vogue Germany This year's July issue of Vogue Germany was dedicated to the late Karl Lagerfeld, who died in February. The former Chanel and Fendi creative director was honoured by Lindbergh with three covers featuring Birgit Kos, Luna Bijl and Vittoria Ceretti. All three models wore looks from Chanel and Fendi. All of the images exuded a peacefulness as provided by the serene beach landscapes in the background. Vogue 10/10 September 2019, British Vogue Lindbergh photographed 15 people for the September issue of British Vogue, which was guest-edited by the Duchess of Sussex. For the issue, which was dubbed \"Forces for Change\", Meghan chose women hailing from politics, film and fashion. Each portrait was taken in a different style with different proportions, but all of them paid homage to Lindbergh's signature natural style.

AFP/Getty\n\nEnninful\u2019s appointment came after British Vogue faced scrutiny for not being diverse enough. After it was announced that he would be taking over from Alexandra Shulman, who had been editor of the publication for 25 years, Naomi Campbell posted a photograph of Shulman\u2019s editorial team on Instagram and pointed out that there were no black people in the picture.\n\n\u201cThis is the staff photo of @britishvogue under the previous editor #AlexandraSchulman\u201d, the supermodel wrote. \u201cLooking forward to an inclusive and diverse staff now that @edward_enninful is the editor\u2026 let\u2019s hear your thoughts?\u201d.\n\nIn the Guardian interview, Enninful explained how greater representation drives his vision for British Vogue, whose recent cover stars include Rihanna, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Halima Aden, who was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of the title.\n\n\u201cMy work always involves documenting what\u2019s around me, and to keep normalising the marginalised,\u201d Enninful said.\n\n\u201cEvery month I can put my hand on my heart and say it\u2019s all there: the black woman, the curvy woman, the Asian woman. We don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about previous criticisms about Vogue\u2019s lack of diversity, Enninful said it \u201creally bothered\u201d him that the publication was seen in this way.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t [Vogue] be for everyone?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t a woman who is black, or Muslim, or gay, or a refugee, or plus-size, see themselves reflected in what we do? Our job is simple: to keep moving the needle.\u201d", "description": "Edward Enninful has spoken out about the criticism aimed at the Duchess of Sussex following the publication of the September issue of British Vogue, which she guest edited.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/11/gettyimages-1157194205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
