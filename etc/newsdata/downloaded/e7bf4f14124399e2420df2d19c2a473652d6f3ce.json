That\u2019s the cheapest we\u2019ve ever seen this model, which, to be fair, isn\u2019t the newest Dyson on the market. But the V7 still works like a tornado to quickly suck up any dirt, dust, dander, or hair that might be covering your floors and furniture, no cords required.\n\nOne caveat: This Dyson is \u201crenewed,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cused.\u201d Instead, this preowned vacuum has been inspected by the folks at Dyson to ensure it works properly and doesn\u2019t show too much cosmetic wear, if any. Plus, it comes with a six-month warranty in case something does go wrong. It\u2019s also a Dyson vacuum under $200, which is as good a deal as you\u2019re ever going to get.\n\nDyson V7 Motorhead HEPA Cordless Vacuum (Renewed) $180 (was $250, now 28% off) $180 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
