Their use is part of the campaign by organisations including The Australian Financial Review.\n\nMr Boyle's disclosures led to a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry making 37 recommendations and a reporting describing the ATO's performance as an \"annus horribilis\".\n\nA separate ombudsman inquiry into garnishee notices said their use was excessive.\n\n'Out of control' commentary\n\nBut Mr Jordan said some commentary was \"out of control\" and Mr Boyle's charges related to alleged breaches of taxation secrecy rules and listening device laws which he described as criminal in nature.\n\n\"The charges do not relate to speaking out about heavy-handed debt collection practices, but rather to allegedly providing taxpayer files to third parties and allegedly recording conversations,\" Mr Jordan said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody in this room would want their private, personal information that is collected under legal compulsion to be made publicly available, contrary to the laws protecting it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the 161-year figure was a \"blatant and knowing mischaracterisation\" of the criminal sentencing system, where sentences for related offences were usually imposed concurrently.\n\nMr Boyle plans to plead not guilty in the case.\n\nMr Jordan said reports Mr Shamir had been put on paid leave immediately after seeking whistleblower protections were incorrect.\n\nHe revealed in 2012 that the ATO had wrongly tagged a series of claims as fraudulent.\n\n\"This is an employee whose unfair dismissal claim was rejected, with the full bench of the Fair Work Commission stating his termination was as a result of his 'unjustified non-performance of duties'.\u201d\n\nThe Senate economics legislation committee suspended its hearings to consider Mr Jordan's statement and the tabling of documents about the cases, deciding the evidence was better placed before a separate inquiry into taxation issues.\n\nLabor Senator Katy Gallagher called Mr Jordan's comments \"extraordinary\".\n\nCentre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick, a regular critic of the ATO, said some of the reporting about the two cases flowed from parliamentary inquiries. He highlighted inconsistencies in public comments by the ATO.\n\n\"I know there has been other media, but a lot of that media flowed from those hearings and weren't necessarily sought out by the people involved,\" he said.\n\nThe Right to Know coalition has highlighted more than 60 pieces of legislation passed in the past 20 years making it harder to report on issues of public interest in the national security realm and which led to punishments for whistleblowers.\n\nThe Morrison government is being pressured to take action, including in the cases of ABC and News Corp journalists who have faced raids by the Australian Federal Police.", "description": "ATO Commissioner Chris Jordan says media reports about the ATO's targeting of whistleblowers are incorrect and misleading.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/891416a9ff9fd754ad59a0abdd6840bae62af7c0", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
