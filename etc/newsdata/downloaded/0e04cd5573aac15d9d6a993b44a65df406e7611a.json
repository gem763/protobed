Charmander as Cubone. Lucario and Celebi as live-action role-players. This year\u2019s batch of special Halloween-themed \u201cPumpkin Parade\u201d plushies from The Pok\u00e9mon Company are adorable at first glance. But if you look closely, the cute facade begins to crumble. Let\u2019s start with Charmander wearing another Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s dead mother\u2019s skull as a costume.\n\nDepending on its generational description, Cubone is either wearing the actual skull of its dead mum, staining the eye holes with its tears, or it\u2019s a random skull the unfortunate critter wears in honour of its dead mother, eye holes similarly stained.\n\nThat in mind, what the hell, Charmander?\n\nNo really, what the hell? Even if it\u2019s only a replica skull, it\u2019s at the very least evocative of another Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s deceased parent. I\u2019m imagining Charmander getting into an elevator on Halloween night with a Cubone. The awkward silence. The quiet weeping. You bastard, Charmander.\n\nPikachu isn\u2019t being any more sensitive of his fellow Pok\u00e9mon with its Mimikyu getup. Yes, seeing Pikachu wearing the skin of a costume resembling a creature whose whole deal is dressing up like Pikachu is a cute juxtaposition.\n\nBut why does Mimikyu disguise itself as Pikachu? Because it wants to be popular. It wants to be loved.\n\nImagine you are lonely. You feel like no one loves you. You idolise a more popular Pok\u00e9mon, hoping to be cherished as much as they are. You go to a Halloween party, alone, and there is the most popular Pok\u00e9mon ever dressed as you, surrounded by friends. Friends you will never have. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how serial killers are born.\n\nLucario isn\u2019t quite as menacing. He\u2019s just sort of pimping it incredibly old school. I call him Lothario Lucario, and I suspect he has plans to sleep with my wife. Look at that cape. That\u2019s a sleeping-with-my-wife cape if I ever saw one.\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the LARPing grounds\u2026\n\nCelebi wants to know if you want to hang around after the Renaissance Fair closes. Things get \u201cpretty wild,\u201d it says. I\u2019d be wary.\n\nCan you spot the dead human face in this picture?\n\nThe remaining three new plushies for the season are pretty harmless. Bulbasaur\u2019s Shedinja costum is incredibly on point. Zorua looks like it\u2019s being eaten by a Crobat, which is a pretty cool effect. And Squirtle? Squirtle is just wearing a top hat and holding a wand. Squirtle is the guy who shows up late to the party wearing just enough to get free candy and booze. We all know a Squirtle.\n\nHopefully we don\u2019t all know a Charmander. It\u2019s just wrong.", "description": "Pikachu as Mimikyu. Charmander as Cubone.
