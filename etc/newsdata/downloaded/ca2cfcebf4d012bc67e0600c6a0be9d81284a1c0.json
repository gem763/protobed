The company has struggled to sell devices, reportedly shipping only 88,000 handsets in its first year. On a far more serious note, Rubin has been plagued by reports of inappropriate behavior during his time at Google. A bombshell report from The New York Times highlighted sexual misconduct accusations prior to his receiving a $90 million exit package from the company.\n\nThe former Google executive last used Twitter to state that the story \u201ccontains numerous inaccuracies about my employment at Google.\u201d Now, a year later, he\u2019s back on the platform touting a new device. It could be the next Essential handset, or it could be something else entirely.\n\nIt\u2019s not the shiny \u201cGEM Colorshift material\u201d on the back that\u2019s caught viewers\u2019 eyes, as much as the \u201cnew UI for radically different formfactor.\u201d The closet thing I can thing to compare the long, skinny handset to is the new Galaxy Fold when closed. Of course, this has the decided advantage of a full length screen.\n\nThe UI appears to be a collection of different widgets, each sporting different apps: weather, maps, calendar and Uber on one, with a full length map on the other. It\u2019s certainly different and even more of a departure from the original Essential handset, which had very little of the industry revolutionizing impact the company was initially hoping for.\n\nA spokesperson for the company confirmed that the new device is in \u201cearly testing\u201d in the real world, which is probably why Rubin opted to get out in front of leaks by showing the half-phone on his own terms, rather than grainy leaks. Here\u2019s the official statement from Essential:\n\nWe\u2019ve been working on a new device that\u2019s now in early testing with our team outside the lab. We look forward to sharing more in the near future.\n\nThere are, of course, way more questions than answers right now, like whether the company is abandoning the first gen\u2019s modular attachment system. Also, is the lack of cellular information at top a sign? Is this why the company acquired CloudMagic? Can one say this is truly \u201cessential\u201d?\n\nAt the very least, the existence of such a device does seem to contradict earlier rumors about Rubin canceling the device and attempting to sell the company. Maybe. If I had to venture a guess, I\u2019d say Essential is courting a similar secondary handset market as Palm \u2014 though that, too, didn\u2019t exactly set the smartphone world ablaze.\n\nMore soon, I suppose.", "description": "Essential CEO Andy Rubin has been pretty silent over the past year for, well, lots of reasons \u2014 both business and otherwise.
