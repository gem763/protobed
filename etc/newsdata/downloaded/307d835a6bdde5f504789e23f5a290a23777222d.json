He tells her that she's only angry \"because I'm young and I'm black.\"\n\nShe responds, \"That's right, because you're black.\" She continues, \"Always looking to milk the system. And you see me, a white woman, so you think I've got money.\"\n\nThe teacher eventually says, \"Go back to your welfare\u2026 your Section 8 house.\" Section 8 is the government's program for providing housing assistance vouchers to low-income families.\n\nThat draws a laugh from the man. While the woman is comparing her truck to his car, which she refers to as a \"piece of (expletive),\" he tells her, \"I've got a 3,200 square-foot home.\"\n\nAfter another exchange, the woman says, \"Go (expletive) off, you (N-word).\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" he replies.\n\n\"You heard me,\" she says.\n\nA statement from Upper Darby School District posted to social media said the teacher was placed on administrative leave pending further investigation. District Superintendent Daniel McGarry told CNN the teacher is on leave \"without pay.\"\n\n\"Upper Darby School District does not condone or tolerate inappropriate conduct or speech associated with hate, racism, discrimination or intolerance of any kind,\" the district said in a statement. \"The deeply troubling comments and actions of this teacher are not indicative of the hundreds of outstanding teachers working in our schools each and every day.\"\n\nAfter the racial slur, the man in the video said, \"This situation can change real quick.\"\n\nThe teacher replies, \"Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it?\"\n\nThe man warns the teacher to stay where she is multiple times while she tells him, \"Bring it on.\" The video ends after the teacher calls the man a homophobic slur.\n\nA Facebook message to the poster of the video from USA TODAY was not immediately returned Sunday night. NBC News reported Noel met with McGarry after the video was posted on Thursday.\n\nIn his Facebook post, Noel said he commended Upper Darby School District for taking quick action against the teacher.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 240,000 times as of Sunday evening.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/13/pennsylvania-teacher-leave-racist-rant-school-parking-lot/3971949002/", "description": "A teacher at Drexel Hill Middle School in Pennsylvania has been placed on administrative leave after she used racial slurs in a viral Facebook video.", "authors": ["Jordan Culver", "Published P.M.
