This is not anything new. This is classic San Francisco, where the downtrodden are celebrated and coddled.\"\n\n\"Little by little, we see the whittling away of law enforcement, and the norm now is having the homeless, the drug addicts, and mentally ill roaming the streets,\" he told the \"Friends\" hosts.\n\nIn the latest effort to combat the growing homelessness in San Francisco, a city resident recently used a plywood wall to block an alleyway known to be used for drug deals and defecation by the homeless. After a few days, the blockade to what\u2019s known as the \u201cIngleside Path\u201d was removed after several complaints.\n\nCity records show the neighbor had permission from the San Francisco Public Works to build the wall, the San Francisco Examiner reported.\n\nGreenberg says that a major culprit is the non-profits -- in tandem with government funding -- that are based in the city who are \"getting hundreds of millions collectively\" to cater to the homeless community.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I believe, and many of us believe here, that they are [all] enabling...homeless to move here, actually,\" he said.\n\n\"So, how could it be that year after year -- even after throwing hundreds of billions into the budget -- that the population of homeless is going up? And that's clearly because others are moving...from other states, other cities, to take advantage of the liberal policies here,\" he concluded.\n\n\"It looks like California is doomed,\" Kilmeade observed.\n\nFox News' Barnini Chakraborty and Brie Stimson contributed to this report.", "description": "Liberal policies in San Francisco are inflating California's homeless crisis and sending longtime residents running from the city,\u00a0former mayoral candidate Richie Greenberg said Thursday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Golden-Gate.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
