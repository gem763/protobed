UFC heavyweight Greg Hardy has win overturned after using INHALER between rounds (VIDEO)", "language": "en", "text": "UFC heavyweight and ex-NFL player Greg Hardy had to suck up yet more scandal as his decision victory against Ben Sosoli was overturned after he used an inhaler between rounds at UFC Boston.\n\nHardy thought he had earned the sixth victory of his MMA career when he was declared a unanimous winner on the scorecards at TD Garden, but the decision was later ruled a no contest due to Hardy\u2019s use of an inhaler between rounds two and three.\n\nHardy, 31, had reportedly asked if the inhaler was permitted, and believed he had been given the necessary approval. However, that was later deemed incorrect and the result was overturned in what appears to be a first for the sport.\n\nFootage of the inhaler usage that led to Greg Hardy's win being overturned and declared a No Contest #UFCBostonpic.twitter.com/qmZ8KtXyVO \u2014 ESPN MMA (@espnmma) October 19, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ventolin albuterol inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. I used it my whole life,\u201d Hardy told reporters afterwards.\n\n\u201cI sign the commission paperwork when I weighed in. It\u2019s on the USADA [US Anti-Doping Agency] paperwork when I take every single drug test...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt literally just clears the airway so I am able to breathe. It\u2019s not so I can breathe better. It helps me breathe just like you, which evens the playing field,\u201d he added.\n\nGreg Hardy uses an inhaler between rounds. Marc Ratner, UFC vice president of regulatory affairs, comes on the broadcast and calls it \"completely illegal, no question about it.\" \u2014 Brett Okamoto (@bokamotoESPN) October 19, 2019\n\nHardy has been a controversial addition to the UFC ranks, having joined the promotion after turning his back on the NFL and after facing domestic abuse allegations.\n\nThere have also been claims he is being given a softer route to the top by promotion bosses desperate to push him, and he was again roundly booed by fans in Boston.\n\nHardy reiterated his belief that he had not been in the wrong on Friday night, after a fight in which he had fought a full three rounds for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sucky feeling... I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I asked permission, they told me I could, and I\u2019m in trouble again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting here talking about an inhaler that I\u2019ve used my whole entire life. That\u2019s a crappy feeling. I never want to take away from the UFC brand. I never want to take away from anybody, and I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, and I\u2019m not OK with that.\u201d\n\nUFC chief Dana White laid the blame squarely at the feet of Hardy\u2019s corner and trainer Din Thomas, saying: \u201cHis corner, they\u2019ve got to know you can\u2019t use an inhaler in the corner. They should know that. Shouldn\u2019t even be a question.\u201d\n\nMMA fighters and fans on Twitter meanwhile also reacted to one of the most bizarre overturned results that the sport has seen.\n\nYo greg hardy just changed the game I cant believe I never thought of this. My coaches better have an oxygen tank available in between rounds from now on \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Sodiq Yusuff (@Super_Sodiq) October 19, 2019\n\nYou can\u2019t an inhaler between rounds idiot. That is cheating and should be disqualification!!!! https://t.co/B6EI4XNorn \u2014 Daniel Cormier (@dc_mma) October 19, 2019", "description": "UFC heavyweight and ex-NFL player Greg Hardy had to suck up yet more scandal as his decision victory against Ben Sosoli was overturned after he used an inhaler between rounds at UFC Boston.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daab63d85f5401b3d7f9fc0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
