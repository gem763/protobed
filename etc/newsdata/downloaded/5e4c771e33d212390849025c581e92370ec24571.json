These may be for written features, long-reads, interactives, photo-essays or videos.\n\n\n\nIf your pitch is time-sensitive and requires a quick response, please clearly say so. We will then endeavour to respond promptly.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, your pitch will be considered in a weekly pitch meeting when members of each team will get together to sift through all of the pitches they have received, and make decisions about those they wish to commission. This may not always be a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 decision. We may like the story you\u2019ve pitched but not the way you plan to tell it. Or we may realise that you\u2019d be the perfect person to tell a different story we have in mind.\n\n\n\nWe understand that waiting can be frustrating. But giving us the time to give proper consideration to your pitch not only gives it a better shot at being commissioned, it also means that it is more likely to end up in front of the best editor for your story \u2014 we all have different strengths and interests \u2014 and to receive the most thorough treatment.\n\n\n\nRemember that this is just the beginning of your working relationship with an editor. The same editor who fights for your pitch to be commissioned during the pitch meeting \u2014 and with limited slots and budget available, this will sometimes involve just that \u2014 will likely be the editor who commissions you, works with you to develop the brief for your story and then eventually edits the final version, going back and forth with you to ensure that it is the best it can possibly be.\n\n\n\nEven if your pitch isn\u2019t accepted, it can be the beginning of a good working relationship. A rejection isn\u2019t always a reflection of the quality of the pitch. We may have just commissioned something on the same topic the week before or your piece may miss out because there are simply more pressing stories at the time.\n\n\n\nBut there are a few things you can do to give your pitch the best chance of being accepted. We\u2019ve compiled the tips below from different editors and hope they help.\n\nBe clear\n\nYour pitch needs to be easily understood. The way you pitch will tell us a lot about the way you write: Can you guide us confidently and concisely through the information we\u2019ll need to make a decision \u2014 the what, when, where, why and who of your story?\n\n\n\nIf you can do that in a pitch, we are more likely to trust that you can do that in a story. But if you leave us baffled and feeling unsure about what exactly your story is, alarm bells may start to ring.\n\n\n\nThink like a storyteller\n\nNow, if you can do the above and intrigue or excite us, you are in with a good shot of being commissioned. And nothing intrigues and excites an editor more than somebody with a great sense of story.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve told us what your story is, now tell us how you plan to tell it. Who will your characters be and how will their stories shed light on the topic? Where will your story be set and what kind of colour and detail can we expect?\n\n\n\nSomething interesting to keep in mind is that at Al Jazeera, we\u2019ll take a writer who is an excellent storyteller but whose language may need some work over somebody with impeccable English but little sense of story every time. We can polish your words, reconstruct your sentences and tweak your grammar, but we can\u2019t portray to the reader the depth of emotion, the sights and the sounds of a mother relaying how she lost her baby because she couldn\u2019t afford medical care \u2014 that\u2019s up to the writer to deliver.\n\n\n\nThrow the formulas out\n\nMany potentially great stories \u2014 compelling stories, the sorts of stories that stay with you long after you have finished reading them \u2014 have been lost to the same old formula of storytelling \u2014 the one that tells you how to structure a feature, regardless of the content of that story. Okay, this formula works \u2014 sometimes. And there are certain checks and balances it provides that shouldn\u2019t be abandoned. But it isn\u2019t always the best way to tell a story. As a writer, ask yourself how you can best communicate this story to really do justice to it. It may be a conventional feature with plenty of voices and a little colour, but it may equally be a first person, a portrait, a letter, a video story, a photo essay.\n\nSuggest this in your pitch. Your commissioning editor may have other ideas. But they will always appreciate the fact that you are thinking creatively, and it could be the start of a conversation that will really bring the best out of your story.\n\n\n\nHow is this an Al Jazeera story?\n\nSo, what is an Al Jazeera story? It\u2019s about the topic, in part. Does this story give a \u2018voice to the voiceless\u2019? If it does, that\u2019s a good start. Does it question dominant, mainstream narratives? That\u2019s also important.\n\n\n\nBut it is also about more than that. The way you tell a story also helps to determine whether it is an Al Jazeera story. Because you can talk to the \u2018voiceless\u2019 without necessarily giving them a \u2018voice\u2019. The way you approach your storytelling is almost as critical as the stories you choose to tell. Where is the balance of power in your story, with you as the narrator, the journalist, the storyteller or with the characters in your story?\n\n\n\nPersevere\n\nGetting to tell stories that you care about, important stories that people need to read, is a privilege. So, even if one of your pitches is turned down, persevere.\n\nTelling important stories beautifully is as important to your editor as it is to you, so they won\u2019t mind you asking for feedback on how to improve.", "description": "The in-depth department of the Al Jazeera English website receives somewhere in the region of 100 pitches a week.
