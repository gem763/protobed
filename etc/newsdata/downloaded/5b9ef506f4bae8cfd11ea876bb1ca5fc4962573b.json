After WSU failed to play like a No. 1-ranked passing team, Leach said the Cougars (3-2, 0-2) believed they were better than they actually are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very soft team,\u201d Leach said. \u201cWe get a lot of good press. We like to read it a lot. We like to pat ourselves on the back and if we get any resistance, we fold.\u201d\n\nThe postgame outburst was similar to the last time his Cougars lost to Utah in 2012. WSU lost 49-6 that day and Leach sent his entire offensive line to the postgame press conference to answer questions.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t any kinder this time around.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a bunch of free agents running around there that think they\u2019re pretty special and then as soon as something doesn\u2019t go their way, they want to pout,\u201d Leach said.\n\nA week ago, WSU disintegrated in a 67-63 loss to UCLA in which they squandered a 32-point, third-quarter lead. On Saturday, the Cougars surrendered 526 yards to a Utah team that didn\u2019t even throw a pass in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t even close,\u201d Leach said. \u201cI think that at some point they have to embrace the effort themselves.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington State coach Mike Leach has never been one to hold his thoughts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Coles"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/washington_st_utah_footaball_46409_c0-226-5400-3374_s1770x1032.jpg?cb5c7867563b2abf97a00a102051a13af94a4d48", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
