I always felt they didn\u2019t get a fair crack in society.\n\n\u2018It sounds a bit weird to say it was like a calling. I don\u2019t mean that in any religious way but it was.\n\n\u2018It was something I knew I could do and wanted to do. I knew there were plenty of adopters around waiting for the \u201ctypical healthy white babies\u201d.\n\n\u2018I said let\u2019s leave them for people who want that and let\u2019s make a family from children who would otherwise not have a family of their own.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorraine, along with husband Derek, still wanted a \u2018normal family life\u2019, filled with birthday parties, picnics in the park and seaside holidays, and the more they looked into children with Down\u2019s syndrome, the more they believed it was \u2018best thing for them\u2019.\n\nLorraine Cridge says her girls were \u2018easy-peasy\u2019 growing up (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nCaption: Lorraine Cridge in Bottesford adopts (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nLorraine said she always wanted to adopt children with disabilities (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThey became parents for the first time in 1986 when they welcomed Layla into their home in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire.\n\nWithin a couple of years, the parents applied to adopt another child, but this time, they were offered twins.\n\nLorraine said their family were \u2018very concerned\u2019 from the start and believed having three children with disabilities could be too much to handle.\n\nShe said: \u2018They still had the old fashioned notion that people with learning disabilities were a burden.\n\n\u2018They were very worried. When it came to the second adoption and we were asked to take twins, a lot of the family were saying three is an awful lot to take on.\n\n\u2018They were expecting it to break down but it never did.\u2019\n\nLorraine\u2019s eldest and youngest, Layla and Lucy (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nAll four girls live together in the family home, while their parents have moved out (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nTwin girls, Carlyn and Rose, were followed by Lucy, the couple\u2019s fourth and final child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorraine said they were always anticipating something to be difficult at each stage of their children\u2019s lives, but it never happened.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was easy peasy. Far less trouble than normal girls. I always knew where they were at night.\n\n\u2018When they were all six to ten and I thought they\u2019re all going to hit puberty and it will be terrible, but it wasn\u2019t at all.\n\n\u2018Maybe I was really lucky and managed to get four really good \u2018uns but they were just not difficult.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018They\u2019re not little angels but they are well-mannered and polite with people.\n\nLorraine Cridge in Bottesford adopts (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nLorraine says Layla has taken on the maternal role in the house (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018They with mix well with both mainstream and special needs, but they don\u2019t see any different between themselves and anybody else.\n\n\u2018They were brought up to believe no one is better than anybody else.\u2019\n\nFast forward three decades and all four girls are grown up and living together in the family home, while mum and dad have moved out.\n\nLorraine said Layla, now aged 32, Carlyn and Rose, 30, and Lucy, 28, are all very different.\n\nShe added: \u2018Layla is very kind and considerate and has taken on the more maternal role, doing most of the housework.\n\n\u2018She tries to get them to do it but she ends up going into their rooms and tidying up after them.\u2019\n\nTwins Carlyn and Rose are inseparable as you might expect (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\nLucy is always making people laugh (Picture: Chris Frear Butterfield for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018The twins are much quieter on the outside, until they get to know people. They are very much in the twin mould. They are very close and stick together a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Where one goes, the other will always go with them.\n\n\u2018Lucy is like Tigger on speed. She\u2019s a bit hyperactive, bouncing off the walls and is just so funny.\n\n\u2018She has everybody in stitches the whole time, she\u2019s a real comedian.\u2019\n\nLorraine said there are \u2018no boundaries\u2019 on children with learning difficulties these days.\n\nShe added: \u2018You might still have to fight a little bit for inclusion.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s there for the taking. You might have to be more determined because you do have to fight for their rights.\n\n\u2018Some people will still say \u201cyou can\u2019t go there\u201d so you have to be prepared to say \u201ctell me why?\u201d\n\n\u2018I would encourage anybody to adopt children with disabilities.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve enriched our lives immensely. They\u2019ve given us a lot more than we\u2019ve given them.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
