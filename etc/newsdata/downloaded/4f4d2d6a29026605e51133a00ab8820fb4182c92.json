That is because we have a president skilled in the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d who knows where he wants to go \u2026 and how to get there.\n\nYou can\u2019t deal with China without protecting and preserving Hong Kong\u2019s historic independence. The Communist leaders of China realize Hong Kong is the \u201cfreedom center\u201d and \u201cfreedom marquee\u201d of their region. President Trump will never sell that out. That is central to any deal on China\u2019s economy and markets.\n\nThe same holds for the West. The \u201cdeep state\u201d that is Western Europe is now being challenged by Boris Johnson and Brexit. The president has gone to Europe to restore \u201csanity\u201d and help the prime minister and England exit the European Union and its deadly Brussels bureaucracy. This is step one in doing the same with Washington\u2019s bureaucracy.\n\nMr. Trump could further boost his Blue Collar Boom, and avert recession, by making a free trade deal with Britain when Mr. Johnson liberates his nation from the EU on Oct. 31. Mr. Trump should similarly make such a deal with Japan, isolating China. Mr. Trump can put an exclamation point on his trade roll if he can close a deal with China. A new trade deal with China would produce an historic era of global prosperity.\n\nThe Democratic House should do its part by passing the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which Mr. Trump has already negotiated. If they don\u2019t, the American people need to rise up and take that power away from them in 2020.\n\nMr. Trump can further boost his historic Blue Collar Boom, and avoid recession, if the Fed would end its deflationary monetary policy, cut interest rates, stabilize the dollar (by stopping the recent artificial increase in the dollar\u2019s value), and stop declining commodity prices. As Milton Friedman explained in his magnum opus, \u201cA Monetary History of the United States,\u201d for which he won the Nobel Prize, the Fed stumbled into the Great Depression by starving the nation of dollars, when the world was demanding dollars as a safe haven.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues haven\u2019t seen or acted on this as quickly as they should have. President Reagan\u2019s Fed did see it quickly enough though. They adopted the Price Rule to guide their policies by early commodity prices in the market. That avoided monetary policy mistakes to keep Reagan\u2019s booming recovery going ultimately for 25 years, from late 1982 until late 2007. If Mr. Powell\u2019s Fed can act soon enough, which would require another major interest rate cut before the fall, Mr. Trump\u2019s recovery can be similarly as long.\n\nDoubling down on Mr. Trump\u2019s world-leading energy domination, instead of abandoning fossil fuels, as under the Democrats\u2019 Green/Red New Deal, would further boost Mr. Trump\u2019s Blue Collar Boom. Avoiding all the tax increases the Democrats are proposing, which would be the fastest route to renewed recession, would be a further relief to America and its newly prosperous working people.\n\nProgressive Democrats and their media sycophants have not acknowledged a fundamental realignment of blue collar working people, the original Democratic Party backbone, which began as far back as Richard Nixon, accelerated under Reagan, and crested under Mr. Trump. That will turn into a rout if the realignment spreads to blacks returning to their original Republican home in 2020 in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s Blue-Collar Boom, and their all-time record low unemployment.\n\nPolls show Hispanics rewarding Mr. Trump as well for their all-time record low unemployment. Probably women, youth and low-wage workers will as well for their record good economic fortune under Mr. Trump. All are also showing record wage increases. The American people are also enjoying record wealth, in the trillions.\n\nWhat a shocker. For all the claims in the Democratic Party-controlled media about Mr. Trump and racism and fantasy white supremacy, Mr. Trump is actually leading the most inclusive economic recovery in American history.\n\nAll with record low inflation and interest rates. Behold the wondrous results of capitalism. Go back to sleep \u201cwoke\u201d Democrats.\n\n\u2022 Lewis K. Uhler is founder and chairman of the National Tax Limitation Committee and Foundation.
