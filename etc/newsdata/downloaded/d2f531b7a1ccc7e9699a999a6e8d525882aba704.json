It is not top of the mind when choosing an airline between Spain and the UK. And its giant Airbus A380 is designed for flying almost 500 people many thousands of miles in long-haul comfort, rather than connecting Mallorca and Manchester \u2013 just 982 miles apart.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Guided us through. We\u2019re really pleased with the service.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is coordinating the operation on behalf of the government, is seeking to emulate as closely as possible the schedule that would have been flown by Thomas Cook Airlines \u2013 had it been allowed to keep flying.\n\nBut assembling a \u201cpop-up\u201d airline is especially challenging this autumn because of a worldwide shortage of narrow-bodied jets such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. This has been caused by the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes that were blamed on an anti-stall system.\n\nSo among the hundred-plus planes chartered by the CAA are some very large aircraft, including the Boeing 747 Jumbo and the Malaysian Airbus A380 \u2013 whose fuselage proudly notes it was the 100th edition of the double-deck to be built.\n\nAs part of the worldwide trend towards more efficient twin-engined aircraft, this four-engined giant is no longer used to shuttle between Kuala Lumpur and Heathrow. It is instead available for ad-hoc charters such as the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca \u2013 or bringing Brits back in the wake of yet another holiday company collapse.\n\nWith 494 seats onboard, Malaysian Airlines flight MH8493 is flying holidaymakers from Palma to Manchester \u2013 with onward connections to Newcastle, East Midlands, Birmingham, Stansted and Gatwick. But the A380 will not be hopping around the UK delivering passengers. Instead they will be put onto buses at Manchester to complete their journey in less luxurious fashion.\n\nIndulgence is the key for Yassin Mrabet, a Londoner in his 30s who is occupying seat 14K on the upper deck \u2013 not sitting, but stretched out along the 6ft 6in length of the flat bed.\n\nAll eight first-class \u201csuites\u201d and 66 business class seats are occupied by passengers who expected to be flying on a high-density, narrow-bodied jet.\n\nMr Mrabet had flown out from Gatwick to Palma on Norwegian but happened to have booked a Thomas Cook flight home. Even though he had opted for a trip not covered by an Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol), he was emailed by the CAA and invited to check in for the flight to Manchester. After two-and-a-half hours of luxury he faces four or five hours on a bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it could be worse. it could be to Glasgow.\u201d\n\nLike many 21st century travellers, he has few travel loyalties.\n\n\u201cI am a holidays-loyal customer. I fly with whoever will fly me to the sea.\u201d\n\nThe A380 is far too large for any of the gates at Palma airport. So instead it is parked at the north of the airfield and passengers are dispatched from the terminal in a series of buses. At the top of the long steps from the Tarmac, Kevin Hardy from Kings Lynn, is not happy: \u201cI just think it\u2019s diabolical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to Manchester airport and then from there being transferred to Stansted. From Stansted we\u2019ve got another hour-and-a-half\u2019s journey back to home.\u201d\n\nBut the vast majority of passengers are very happy with the journey that fortune had delivered them. Dame Deirdre Hutton, chair of the CAA, is onboard, and addresses them on the plane\u2019s public-address system: \u201cWe know this was quite an unsettling end to your holiday.\u201d\n\nNo one looks unsettled. One of the cabin crew who had completed a dozen shuttles between Manchester and Spain\u2019s main holiday island said the passengers are confused by being offered tea, coffee and soft drinks \u2013 which they need not pay for.\n\nNot directly, at least. Operation Matterhorn is expected to cost \u00a3100m, of which \u00a360m will be covered by the Air Travel Trust \u2013 the fund where millions of \u00a32.50 Atol contributions go each year. But the remaining \u00a340m is provided by the government to fly home travellers who had chosen not to buy an Atol-protected trip. Many in the travel industry are angry about what they say is a message sent out to the travelling public that they need not bother with Atol.\n\n\u201cI can understand the feeling about that, but it\u2019s a matter of practicality,\u201d Dame Deirdre told The Independent. \u201cHow could we expect people in small airports around the world to distinguish between Atol and non-Atol passengers?\u201d\n\nAfter the collapse of Monarch Airlines \u2013 exactly two years ago \u2013 nothing has changed in the insolvency regime for travel firms.\n\nShe said she \u201cwould certainly very much welcome that\u201d \u2013 adding: \u201cIt has been a heroic effort by very many people, not least the industry, to help us get everybody home.\u201d\n\nMany traveller have evidently found other ways home. Of around 400 potential passengers, only 233 are on board \u2013 so fewer than half the seats are occupied.\n\nSisters Ann and Angela Goodall are the last of the Malaysian Airlines passengers to emerge from Arrivals at Manchester airport. For 72-year-old Ann, the holiday in Mallorca had been her first-ever trip abroad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be going again,\u201d she said.", "description": "*/  \u201cThank you for choosing Malaysia Airlines,\u201d says the lead member of cabin crew as she welcomes us to Manchester.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/23/malaysiaairlines.jpg"}
