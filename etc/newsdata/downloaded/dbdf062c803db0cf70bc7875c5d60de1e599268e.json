The dispatcher on the call, identified by the paper as Donna Reneau, was working her last shift as a dispatcher and dispatch trainer when she picked up the call early Saturday morning.\n\nRelated Video: Chicago Releases Smollett Incident 911 Calls\n\nA statement from the Fort Smith Police Department said that officers and firefighters were \u201cinundated with 911 calls from other citizens also stranded in flood waters,\u201d which led to a delay in aiding Stevens. The statement says rescue efforts were hampered by the intense flooding, as well as Stevens\u2019 inability to describe her exact location.\n\nStevens called, saying that the water was \u201call the way up to my windows, and I can\u2019t get out, and I\u2019m scared to death, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you please help me?\u201d she asked the dispatcher.\n\nThe dispatcher, who the Times Record identified as Reneau, repeatedly told Stevens that she would not drown.\n\nLater in the call, Stevens pleads with Reneau, telling her she\u2019s scared. Reneau replied that she\u2019s \u201cgoing to have to hold on\u201d before aid can come to her.\n\nAround 11 minutes in, Reneau scolds Stevens, asking why she drove into water, and telling her that this would be a learning opportunity for her.\n\n'Intense pressure': With 911 dispatchers in short supply, average response time is slower\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Stevens said, to which Reneau responded, \u201cI don\u2019t see how you didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nThree minutes later, Reneau tells Stevens: \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t going to put themselves in danger just because you put yourself in danger.\u201d\n\nStevens, later in the call, told Reneau that the water was up to her neck. Seemingly panicked, Stevens interrupted Reneau\u2019s instructions, to which she told her to \u201cshut up.\u201d\n\nInterim Police Chief Danny Baker told the Southwest Times Record that Reneau would have been reprimanded for her conduct in the call, but did not find anything warranting a criminal investigation.\n\nAfter Stephens started screaming \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Reneau told her, \u201cMiss Debbie, you are breathing just fine, because you are screaming at me. So calm down.\u201d\n\nWhen first responders finally arrived to the car, the department said, she had tragically succumbed to drowning.\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken for this tragic loss of life and my prayers are with Debra\u2019s family and friends,\u201d said Baker in the statement. \u201cAll of our first responders who attempted to save Mrs. Stevens are distraught over the outcome. For every one of us, saving lives is at the very core of who we are and why we do what we do. When we are unsuccessful, it hurts.\u201d\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Arkansas woman drowns after 911 dispatcher tells her to 'shut up'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Debra Stevens drowned while she was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher Saturday after flash floods swept her away.
