I would rather we shut our doors,' Mr Bashaarat said.\n\nHe criticised the Labour motion but also criticised the 'unholy triumvirate' of Boris Johnson, David Cameron and Jacob Rees-Mogg for making 'the Eton brand toxic'.\n\nWhile many private school heads have opposed Labour's policy to introduce VAT on school fees and scrap business rate exemptions that come with charitable status, Mr Bashaarat is seemingly alone in championing the importance of having education institutions free of government initiatives.\n\nThe school (pictured) advertises itself as being 'different' from the schools of its time, having been founded in 1893\n\nMr Bashaarat, whose school's alumni include presenter Kirstie Allsopp (left) and singer Lily Allen (right), said Bedales could not become subject to the national curriculum or 'policymakers' preoccupations' with competitive exams and rote learning\n\nHe called the conversation about integration 'timely and necessary', but added: 'We in the UK have an awfully long way to go before schools such as mine might operate in mainstream education without sacrificing everything good that we do.'\n\nThe school, founded in 1893, advertises itself as being 'different' from the schools of its time.\n\nActor Daniel Day Lewis also attended the school\n\n'Where others imposed conformity, Bedales nurtured individuality, initiative and an enquiring mind,' its website states.\n\n'True to its roots and founding principles the school places emphasis on collaboration and care for others.\n\n'Our students are naturally ambitious and competitive, and build strong relationships with each other and their teachers based on mutual respect; everyone, staff and students, is on first name terms.\n\n'This approach enables students to concentrate on the complex business of learning, developing and becoming their own person.'\n\nThe school says it offers 'more interesting and more demanding' Bedales Assessed Courses, boasting that students 'move on comfortably to university and beyond because they are self-disciplined, are already used to organising their own time, to studying in depth and to mixing and debating with their elders'.", "description": "Magnus Bashaarat (pictured), head of Bedales school in Steep, Hampshire, hit out at a Labour motion to integrate all private schools  into the government system.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/14/19332412-0-image-a-49_1570281377010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
