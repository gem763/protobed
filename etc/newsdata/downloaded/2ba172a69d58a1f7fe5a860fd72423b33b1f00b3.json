She has dressed her children, Jesus, 5, and Suany, 8, in their best clothes and implored them to sit quietly beside her.\n\nShe prays that her husband, Jose, who was murdered back home, is \u201cin a good place.\u201d She prays to be strong for her kids in this new country, to live long enough to see them grow up. She prays for the family members she left behind.\n\nRivera views her new life with conflicting emotions. For their first year in the United States, she and the children were guests in a relative\u2019s house, and she constantly worried they were outstaying their welcome. Recently, she and her sister, who arrived from Honduras a few months ago, rented a small apartment together.\n\nRivera, Suany and Jesus share an inflatable mattress in a bedroom with Rivera\u2019s teenage niece. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot, but we are happy,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter walking thousands of miles north through Guatemala and Mexico, where in the spring they sought protection in a caravan, the three asked for U.S. asylum in May 2018 at the port of entry near San Diego, California. They spent three weeks in U.S. custody, then convinced an immigration official they had a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning home. They were released pending court hearings to decide their fate - a process that could take years.\n\n(For an interactive version see tmsnrt.rs/2VssPY7)\n\nAs grateful as she is to be in America, Rivera is homesick. She breaks into tears as she lists the relatives and close friends she misses. \u201cBut because of what happened, I don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to an asylum officer\u2019s notes reviewed by Reuters, Rivera told the officer in May 2018 that her husband, a farmer, was murdered by field workers after he threatened to report them to authorities for stealing valuable palm fruit from the land he tilled. In the fertile Bajo Aguan region where the family lived, a violent conflict is raging over land rights. The area has been flagged by Human Rights Watch as an epicenter of murders \u201cwith impunity.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Irma Rivera, an asylum-seeker from Honduras, spends time with her children Jesus and Suany upon getting home from work in Fort Worth, Texas, U.S., June 6, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott\n\nAfter the murder, \u201ceverything fell apart for me,\u201d Rivera told Reuters. She said the same group that killed her husband \u2013 never apprehended by police - threatened the rest of the family, forcing her to sell their house and flee with the children. Since then, she has heard, her village has only become more dangerous, and even more families are making their way north.\n\nRivera arrived in the United States with straightforward expectations. \u201cI thought the children would go to school, and I\u2019d work, and I\u2019d get settled,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been very difficult here.\u201d\n\n(Photo essay: reut.rs/2pcZoxc)\n\nShe is still grieving for her husband. Every time something new happens, she said, \u201cI want to tell him about it.\u201d\n\nShe is not yet able to work legally, and has struggled to make rent and pay lawyers\u2019 fees. She relies in part on the generosity of family and friends.\n\nRecently an American woman asked her a question in English and she was embarrassed because she couldn\u2019t understand, let alone reply.\n\nHer kids miss Honduras, too - the many children in their extended family, not to mention their dog, Rocky.\n\nBut they are adapting, faster than she is. Suany, who attends a bilingual school, speaks both English and Spanish with her new friends. Jesus has learned a few words and phrases, among them: \u201cWhat is your name? What are you doing?\u201d And: \u201cCar!\u201d\n\nRivera watched the news in August about the white supremacist in El Paso who targeted immigrants and Latinos in a mass shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s racism,\u201d she said - something she worries about but says she has never experienced in this country.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nShe prays she and the children will be able to stay here. Recently, Rivera said she heard of a woman denied asylum and given 30 days to leave the country.\n\n\u201cTo know that could happen\u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the thought.", "description": "Irma Rivera is praying.", "authors": ["Kristina Cooke", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439269483&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99106", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
