The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.12% edged lower by 1.8 basis points to 2.233%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nIn recent days, Treasury markets have moved on developments around the U.K.\u2019s attempts to break away from the European Union, a source of geopolitical concerns that have rattled investors in the last few years.\n\nU.K.\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may push for a general election, if the EU agreed to extend the deadline for the U.K. to leave the economic bloc. This comes after lawmakers rejected the short timetable for Johnson\u2019s proposals on Tuesday, making it unlikely that he would be able to push for a deal before the end of Oct. 31.\n\nIn addition, with U.S. stock market heavyweights such as Caterpillar CAT, -0.27% , Texas Instruments TXN, -5.96% and Boeing BA, +2.60% badly missing forecasts, worries are growing that household spending will be next to suffer if the import tariff fights drag on.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department will sell $41 billion of 5-year notes at 1 p.m. Eastern. Trading for government paper can be influenced by the introduction of fresh debt issuance into the outstanding market.\n\nAnalysts say there could be less interest among buyers in this week\u2019s round of debt auctions ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next week where it is expected to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point, a move which is likely to push short-term rates lower.\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cThe question is whether PM Johnson is confident he can deliver an exit in a matter of weeks. If not, he may prefer a general election but this requires the support of two thirds of MPs, or losing a motion of no-confidence triggered by the opposition,\u201d said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "description": "U.S. Treasury yields fall as the chance of a Brexit deal being ratified before the end of October dimmed, drawing investors into haven assets like U.S....", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
