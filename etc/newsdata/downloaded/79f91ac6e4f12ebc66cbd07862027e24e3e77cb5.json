Instead, it was the online comments that caused the it. Miller, whose sexual assault was widely covered by the media in 2016, speaks out about her experience and her healing in a new clip from her forthcoming interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on the talk show star\u2019s Super Soul Sunday on September 29.\n\nUntil three weeks ago, Miller was only known as Emily Doe, the anonymous woman who was sexually assaulted by then-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner in 2015. In 2016, Turner was found guilty of three felonies, including assault with intent to rape, and sentenced to six months in county jail with three years\u2019 probation (he was later released after three months). At Turner\u2019s trial, Miller read a 7,000-word victim impact statement that, when it was published by BuzzFeed, was read millions of times.\n\nEarlier this month, Miller publicly revealed her identity in an interview with the New York Times. On September 24, she released a memoir, Know My Name, about her experience. In a two-hour special on this weekend\u2019s Super Soul Sunday, Miller talks about her experience and her healing.\n\n\u201cInitially, I didn\u2019t feel shame,\u201d she tells Winfrey in the clip. \u201cIt seemed very clear to me that if someone attacks you and runs away, that\u2019s his problem. The shame was learned over time, from the online comments.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cShame needs a contained space in order to grow, and since I wasn\u2019t telling anyone, it was just festering inside me, unmonitored. As soon as I released the [victim impact] statement, then it was able to breathe. And as soon as you open it up and let it out a little, it loses so much power.\u201d\n\nWinfrey agrees, saying, \u201cIt can\u2019t hide when it\u2019s no longer a secret. The secret is what breeds and festers.\u201d Miller responds, \u201cAbsolutely. And you begin to form these negative ideas of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich are not helped by reading comments on the internet,\u201d Winfrey adds, causing Miller to laugh and agree.\n\n\n\nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?\n\nNo, The Stanford Rape Survivor Isn't \"Lucky\"\n\nVoters Recall Brock Turner's Judge\n\nBrock Turner Lost His Appeal Case", "description": "Chanel Miller felt ashamed after her sexual assault \u2014 but not because of the sexual assault itself.
