The car was not in my full control at the time.\"\n\nThe incident in August 2018 appeared to be the second terrorist attack at parliament in under 18 months.\n\nIn March 2017, terrorist Khalid Masood, 52, mowed down and killed four pedestrians - Aysha Frade, 44, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Kurt Cochran, 54, and Andreea Cristea, 31 - on Westminster Bridge and stabbed unarmed Pc Keith Palmer to death in the grounds of Parliament before being shot dead.", "description": "Salih Khater, 30, deliberately ploughed his car into a pedestrian and cyclists before trying to mow down two officers at 30mph in a suspected terror attack outside Parliament in central London", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Cps Twitter", "Pa", "Getty Images Europe", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17491379.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Westminster-terror-suspect-namedSalih-Khater1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
