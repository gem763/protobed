REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nThe Ontario government said on Wednesday it filed an appeal of the federal carbon tax in Canada\u2019s Supreme Court, arguing that the carbon tax, enacted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government in April, was unconstitutional.\n\nTrudeau instituted a federal carbon tax in Ontario - as well as Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick - after they failed to implement a provincial carbon tax.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to using every tool at our disposal to fight against the job-killing carbon tax,\u201d Jeff Yurek, Ontario minister of environment, said in a statement.\n\nIn June the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected Ontario\u2019s argument that the carbon tax was unconstitutional.\n\nOntario is not alone in suing the federal government over the carbon tax, which is expected to be a key - and polarizing - issue in Canada\u2019s October federal election.\n\nSaskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba have also each filed their own lawsuits against the carbon tax and a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court for the Ontario government could allow the provinces to remove the tax.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberal Party supporters rank it among their top concerns, while Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative backers put it near the bottom of their list of priorities.\n\nIn June, Scheer unveiled his long-awaited climate and environment plan that would eliminate the current federal carbon pricing if voted to power.\n\nFederal Finance Minister Bill Morneau slammed Ontario\u2019s court challenge on Wednesday.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford \u201chas no plan for the environment beyond stickers on gas pumps and now a costly and unnecessary Supreme Court challenge,\u201d Morneau said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is not the course Ontarians want their government to take but we will defend our plan because it is the right thing to do now and for our future.\u201d", "description": "The province of Ontario has taken its fight against the Canadian federal government's carbon tax to the country's top court, after losing an initial challenge in a lower court.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190828&t=2&i=1423802162&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7R22R-OCADN"}
