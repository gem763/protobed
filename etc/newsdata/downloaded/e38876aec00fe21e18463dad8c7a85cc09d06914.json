The Turkish border town of Nusaybin was hit by six Kurdish rockets fired from Qamishli, in Syria, a town that has until yesterday been virtually untouched by the war.\n\nKurdish-led forces said last night they had \u201crepelled\u201d a ground attack by Turkish troops.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to create a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d in Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, who his country dubs terrorists.\n\n(Image: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nLast night it emerged 14,000 Syrian rebel fighters had signed up to back Turkey against the Kurds, with comm\u00adanders ordering them to show no mercy.\n\nIt is feared SDF troops could be overrun or pulled away from the prisons full of IS fighters.\n\nColonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British forces in Afghanistan and advised the government on counter terrorism, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Islamic State is very much still a threat to the West and, of course, Britain.\n\n\"We face a grave threat from Islamic State and it is possible a US withdrawal and Turkey entering Syria could create conditions for a revival of IS.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAnd if that happens, if terrorists are allowed freely to plot attacks locally and also against the West we could see a greater threat to Britain than before.\u201d\n\nBritish special forces are in northern Syria in small numbers in operations against remaining pockets of IS.\n\nFormer British Army officer and Syria expert Colonel Hamish de Bretton Gordon said US withdrawal could mean \u201cwe have a few weeks to act, otherwise Islamic State could become just as potent a terrorist force as it was before\u201d.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \u201cI have serious concerns about the unilateral military action Turkey has taken.\n\n\u201cThis risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering and undermining the progress made against Daesh [IS].\u201d\n\nBritain and other allies were yesterday planning to raise their concerns to the UN Security Council.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cI am deeply concerned at the actions of the Turkish military in the Kurdish areas of northern Syria and the security of the Kurdish people.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a withdrawal of all foreign forces from Syria.\u201d\n\nLeaving Syria - why is 'dishonorable and stupid?' Q. Why is Turkey attacking Kurds in North-East Syria? A. Because it views Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists who support other Kurds who have launched attacks in Turkey. They also prefer their old enemy Syria to be unstable, and peace has broken out lately. Q. Why should Britain care? A. Because the Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces were trained by British and US troops to defeat Islamic State and they lost 11,000 comrades in brutal fighting. Crucially, because IS could attack the UK again if the Kurds are beaten by Turkey, since it is their SDF force that stood between us and the terrorists. Q. Is the violence contained? A. It\u2019s a very dangerous time because Turkish troops have been backed by Syrian rebels, some of whom served in extremist groups. Anarchy in North-East Syria could let IS surge back into action, sparking attacks in Europe. While Iran and Russia supported Syria\u2019s Assad regime, Turkey was quietly helping IS by turning a blind eye to illegal border crossings. Q. What can be done to stop it? A. Donald Trump has threatened to hit the Turkish economy if President Recep Erdogan\u2019s troops go too far, which they no doubt will. The West must lean on Turkey to show restraint and stop turning what is already a kind of proxy war into something far worse. Q. How significant is Turkey\u2019s attack in a war that has seen unsurpassed levels of horror? A. It is hugely significant and the timing is terrible. An uneasy peace had broken out in Kurdish-controlled North-East Syria and the IS terrorists had been almost contained. Sleeper cells are at large but have remained quiet. Turkey\u2019s action could be the signal for a new awakening of terrorism in the region, stretching across into Europe. The Syria-Turkish border, now more in tatters than ever before, has been a main conduit for terror in Syria thanks to Turkey turning that blind eye. Just to complicate things further, Turkey is a member of NATO.\n\nTrump has threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the push into Syria goes too far.\n\nBritish troops are also taking part in secret missions to try to guard extremist camps in North-East Syria, home to tens of thousands of refugees such as exiled British jihadi bride Shamima Begum.\n\nBritish jihadist prisoners such as 'Jihadi' Jack Letts are also in SDF prisons.\n\nThere are also fears that IS has thousands of fighters holed up in sleeper cells in Syria, ready to rise up if war breaks out there again.\n\n(Image: STR/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe SDF are a Kurdish-led force aimed only at fighting IS.\n\nThey have lost 11,000 men and women fighting IS over five years. Some were trained by ex-Paras from Britain.\n\nRoughly half a million people have died since the conflict began in Syria in 2011.\n\nIt is unknown how many Kurdish civilians have been killed in those eight years.\n\nErdogan has threatened to resettle two million refugees in North Syria.", "description": "Insiders call the withdrawal of US troops to help Kurds in Syria 'irresponsible, foolish dishonorable and stupid'", "authors": ["Chris Hughes", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Jim Lo Scalzo Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters", "Str Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TOPSHOT-SYRIA-CONFLICT-TURKEY-KURDS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
