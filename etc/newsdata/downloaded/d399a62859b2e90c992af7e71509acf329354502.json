This puts the score for the 10 coins at the verge of the negative zone.\n\nFollowing the recent turbulence in the market, we now see the Sentscores dropping for all top ten coins, with four coins falling into the negative zone: XRP, LTC, BCH, and BNB, respectively. The rest are seated deep into the neutral zone, with scores between 4.1 and 4.8, while the number one on the list, Bitcoin, dropped from the positive 6/10 to the neutral 5.2/10.\n\nSentiment change among the top 10 coins*:\n\nInterpreting the Sentscore\u2019s scale:\n\n- 0 to 2.5: very negative\n\n- 2 to 4: somewhat negative zone\n\n- 4 to 6: Neutral zone\n\n- 6 to 7.5: somewhat positive zone\n\n- 7.5 to 10: very positive\n\nSource: Omenics, 11:55 UTC\n\nWith all ten coins seeing a drop, this week\u2019s winner will be the coin that plunged the least. Given that all but one saw a double-digit drop, that one is the winner: Tether. Now occupying the 4th, compared to last week\u2019s 6th spot, USDT has got 5.5 in news, 4.7 in social, and 4.4 in buzz, but 4 in technicals and 3.3 in fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin Sentscore\n\nSource: Omenics\n\nTurning to the coins on the losing end this Monday, we find LTC dropping 25.7%, followed by BCH with 24.9% and ETH 24.2%. Litecoin\u2019s strongest aspect is news (4.8/10), while its weakest is technicals (2.8). BCH got its highest grade in social (4.7) and its lowest in buzz and technicals (2.8 each). Finally, ETH got 6 in fundamentals, but 2.1 in buzz.\n\nOut of 39 coins that are currently tracked by Omenics, besides the top 10 list, seven are in the negative zone this Monday (ETC is no longer among them though), while three are in the 5-5.9 range, compared to last week\u2019s twelve.\n\n___\n\n* - Methodology:\n\nOmenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the Sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals based upon their proprietary algorithms.\n\nAs their website explains, \u201cOmenics aggregates trending news articles and viral social media posts into an all-in-one data platform, where you can also analyze content sentiment,\u201d later adding, \u201cOmenics combines the 2 sentiment indicators from news and social media with 3 additional verticals for technical analysis, coin fundamentals, and buzz, resulting in the Sentscore which reports a general outlook for each coin.\u201d For now, they are rating 39 cryptocurrencies.", "description": "This Monday sees a new first in this particular series of articles as the average crypto market sentiment measure, Sentscore, for the top 10 coins by market capitalization dropped for the third week in a row, from 5.01/10 last week, to 4.1 this week, according to Omenics, a crypto market sentiment analysis service.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/22ae6ac8ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
