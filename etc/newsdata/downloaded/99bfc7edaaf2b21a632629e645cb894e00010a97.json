His campaign website shows he\u2019s about $150,000 short of the amount he targeted on Sept. 21 to have a viable path to victory.\n\nAlthough he has languished at 2% or 3% in most polls and is struggling in fund raising, Booker has qualified for the October debate of Democratic presidential candidates. In the CNN interview, Booker said he has also met the threshold of 165,000 unique donors required to participate in the November debate.\n\nBooker also rose to the defense of the Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, saying the accusations from President Donald Trump that the former vice president acted improperly to benefit his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine are unfounded.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be running if I didn\u2019t think I should be president, not him,\u201d Booker said of Biden, with whom he has clashed on the campaign trail and at debates.\n\nYet the allegations from Trump \u201cshould in no way affect the vice president in his pursuit of the nomination,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can in no way besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades.\u201d\n\nInstead, Booker said the focus should be on the actions of Trump and his family, and said he would tighten the rules if elected president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going on with the Trump family right now and Trump properties, and I just find that deeply offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what\u2019s honorable, ethical, not to mention consistent with the emoluments clause,\u201d he said, referring to a clause in the Constitution that forbids accepting payments from foreign governments. \u201cI just don\u2019t think children of president and vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Hailey Waller in New York at hwaller@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Max Berley, Mark Niquette\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Cory Booker said he could end his presidential campaign by Tuesday unless he is able to reach his goal of $1.7 million in donations within the next 36 hours.Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, the New Jersey senator said that despite an \u201cavalanche of support,\u201d his campaign", "authors": ["Hailey Waller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2Ejj.IxH2CkL2Y.Wf88SOw--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/321a0120-e373-11e9-bfa3-961b714e2e7b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
