Lee statue violate a state law protecting war memorials, the Daily Progress reported. The decision last week ends a lawsuit filed in March 2017 opposing the Charlottesville City Council vote to remove statue on the grounds that it sends a racist message.\n\nThe planned removal ostensibly prompted the Unite the Rally at which a neo-Nazi drove a car into counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.\n\n'Tell the truth about them': Blocked from taking Confederate statues down, Atlanta, Birmingham, Memphis try other ideas\n\nMoore issued a permanent injunction, the Progress reported, preventing future removal. His ruling also applied to a statue of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, also located in downtown Charlottesville.\n\nSiding with the plaintiffs and against the city, Moore said the state law protecting war memorials does not have discriminatory intent.\n\nAfter Charlottesville: Confederate memorials turn up faster than they can be removed\n\n\"I don't think I can infer that a historical preservation statute was intended to be racist,\" he said. \"Certainly, (racism) was on their minds, but we should not judge the current law by that intent.\"\n\nConfederate monuments lose standing across the U.S.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Charlottesville Confederate statue removal blocked by judge", "description": "A Virginia judge has blocked the city of Charlottesville's effort to remove the Confederate statue that sparked a deadly white nationalist rally.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_mvAtiPL3n.GqPknhqS3fA--~B/aD0yODMyO3c9NDI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/eb50500bf9c62398525979e76ec4b484", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
