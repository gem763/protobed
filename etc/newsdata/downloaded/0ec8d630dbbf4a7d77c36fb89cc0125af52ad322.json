It is not only the hills around Los Angeles which have caught fire.\n\nRoughly 1,800 horses are trained at Santa Anita with 200 galloping on any given day. The 30 fatalities in the first three months of the year may have been the result of a perfect storm of conditions, not least an abnormally wet winter, which did nothing to improve a dirt track that can be brutal at the best of times. But many of those conditions, it seems, were preventable; such as the suggestion that trainers were being leaned on to boost field sizes with patched-up horses.", "description": "American racing, particularly in California, has never been under greater pressure than now after a spate of horse fatalities led to the early closure of Santa Anita\u2019s winter-spring meet in March.", "authors": ["Marcus Armytage", "Racing Correspondent", "Charlie Brooks"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214052675-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpdpCsDEHI-S5JwZr3nT67BV9ZwIsYDplfHTpZmS3UY8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
