Whatever the case may be, here's a fun update in this saga: Justin Bieber really wants to go on a double date with them. Boy, the amounts I would pay to be a fly on the wall of that date.\n\nWhen Cody posted a picture of himself in a speedo for the 'Gram this week, everyone flooded his account with the thirstiest comments while Rob Lowe's son made a joke about his nipples. But amid all the fans trying to shoot their shot, Justin slid in there to let Cody know his body is \"a wonderland\" before asking, \"Double date?\"\n\nApparently, when you're the Biebs, hanging out with Cody and Miley is as simple as that. The \"iYiYi\" singer told him, \"Text me.\"\n\nHonestly, I really hope this comes to fruition and just becomes a night of poetry writing for the two aspiring Shakespeares. Earlier this week, Cody shared a poem that's widely assumed to be about Miley under his pen name, Prince Neptune. He wrote:\n\n\"The moon\u2019s souvenir /the boulevardier / a ballerina on the promenade / we open our curtains / to the domesticated world / for a natural hour / spinning elvis records / and making love / in the soft jewelled morning.\u201d\n\nI'm no English scholar but this sounds like ~romance.~\n\nAnd in April, Justin wrote one for Hailey that went like:\n\n\"Sound of the crickets a true meditation / I think of you, gods greatest creation / As i fall into this blissful state / I ponder on how you\u2019re MY SOULMATE / Its getting dark to dark to see / A chilling breeze embraces me / The smell of camomile fresh from the garden / My life is a movie that both of us star in.\"\n\nI mean, just think of the poetic possibilities that can come from this double date!!!!!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Would pay good money to be a fly on that wall.", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2BSIFAZDIzp01KjeB.1xag--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNzkxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/35c4115abd5634bc065b5b389c2f8d3b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
