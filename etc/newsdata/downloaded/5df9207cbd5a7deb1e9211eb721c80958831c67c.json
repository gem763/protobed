The prior day, the market indicated a 77 percent chance. A week ago, it was just a 49 percent chance.\n\nThe odds now favor another rate cut in December and give a reasonable chance of one in January. The chances of a December cut moved up to 54.6 percent on Thursday from 38.6 percent on Wednesday. A week ago, the odds were just about 19 percent.\n\nAnother cut in January, which would reduce the Fed\u2019s target to between just 1 percent and 1.25 percent, now has a 30 percent chance, up from 18 percent yesterday and just 6.7 percent a week ago.\n\nSurvey data from the Institute for Supply Management this week indicated that the manufacturing sector may have contracted for the second consecutive month in September and the larger services sector may be growing more slowly than expected. ISM surveys from Europe show anemic growth and data suggests Germany\u2019s economy may already be in a recession.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. labor market appears to be strong. A report on private payrolls from ADP/Moody\u2019s showed the economy continued to add jobs in September, even if hiring has cooled from earlier in the year. And data released Thursday on jobless claims were consistent with a healthy labor market. It is likely that expansive fiscal policy\u2013including the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts and a high level of government spending, which inflated the government\u2019s budget deficit and added spending power to the private sector\u2013is helping keep demand for labor high.\n\nLow unemployment and ongoing job creation are critical components to keeping the U.S. economy afloat because they support robust consumer spending, adding to the incomes of Americans producing the goods and services consumers purchase. A pull back in job creation or a sharp rise in unemployment would put that at risk as Americans would likely reduce spending in anticipation of a more challenging economy.", "description": "The odds implied by futures markets now favor a cut in October and another in December.
