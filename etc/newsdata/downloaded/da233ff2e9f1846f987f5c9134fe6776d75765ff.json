Oxenberg's book, \"Captive: A Mother's Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult,\" was released in August.\n\n\"The had this supposed leadership self-help program and he funneled people through and it looked legitimate,\" she explained. \"I thought that there was some benefit in the beginning, but truthfully it's a bait and switch and it was a recruitment funnel for sexual partners for him, but you didn't know that walking in.\"\n\nAfter a six-week trial, Raniere, 59, was convicted in June 2019 of charges including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, forced labor conspiracy, sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and attempted sex trafficking.\n\nRaniere was also ordered to pay over $1 million to the investigative firm used to fend off civil lawsuits by the state of New York.\n\nOxenberg said that her daughter has since \"done a lot of healing\" and is \"in a very empowered place.\"\n\n\"I'm really, really proud of her. It was a terrifying ordeal,\" Oxenberg said.\n\nAccording to Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the eastern district of New York, \"Smallville\" actress Allison Mack recruited women into what they believed was a \"female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere.\"\n\nRaniere did not testify at trial and his defense attorney did not call any witnesses, but contended in court that the relationships were consensual, not forced.\n\nOxenberg said she expects to attend Raniere's sentencing when that day comes.\n\n\"It's a privilege to watch the wheels of justice turning and to watch justice being served,\" she said. \"This man deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail. He's a danger to society.\"\n\nIf she could confront Raniere today, Oxenberg said she would tell him \"his reign of terror is over.\"\n\n\"Escaping the NXIVM Cult: A Mother's Fight to Save Her Daughter\" premieres Sept. 21 on Lifetime.\n\nABC News' Aaron Katersky contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/catherine-oxenberg1-abc-ml-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
