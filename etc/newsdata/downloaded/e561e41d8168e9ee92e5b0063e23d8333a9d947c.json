The league warned him that they would throw the book at him for another offence, and have done.\n\nFor Gruden and Carr to criticise the length of his ban, and furthermore claim Burfict\u2019s behaviour is out of character, is frankly ridiculous.\n\nBurfict thinks he can hurt people without repercussion just because he does so wearing his Raiders uniform.\n\nI fully endorse the NFL\u2019s extended ban and hope they also told Burfict that if there are any further similar incidents he will be out of the league for good!", "description": "Oakland Raiders Vontaze Burfict was banned for the rest of the season by the NFL after his vicious late blow on Indianapolis Colts tight end, Jack Doyle", "authors": ["Sam Quek", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527326.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NFL-2019-Raiders-vs-Colts-SEP-29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
