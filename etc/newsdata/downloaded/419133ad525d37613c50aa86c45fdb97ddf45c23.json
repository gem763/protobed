Ukraine Expert", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Erin Schaff/The New York Times George P. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of Ukraine policy, arriving on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 George P. Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, on Tuesday became the latest high-ranking witness to be questioned behind closed doors by House impeachment investigators, facing questions about his knowledge of the widening Ukraine scandal.\n\nAs Democratic leaders privately debated whether to hold a vote in the coming days to officially open an impeachment inquiry they began three weeks ago, Mr. Kent sat with investigators despite being directed by the State Department not to do so, filling in crucial blanks in their account.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nMr. Kent raised concerns to colleagues early this year about the pressure being directed at Ukraine by Mr. Trump and his private lawyer,Rudolph W. Giuliani to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals, according to people familiar with Mr. Kent\u2019s warnings.\n\n\n\nAs far back as March, they said, Mr. Kent pointed to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in what he called a \u201cdisinformation\u201d campaign intended to use a Ukrainian prosecutor to smear Mr. Trump\u2019s adversaries. Those included former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the United States ambassador to Ukraine, and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information during the 2016 campaign about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nIt is that campaign that is at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which is based on the account of an intelligence official who filed a whistle-blower complaint that alleged that Mr. Trump abused his power to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr. Kent, wearing a three-piece suit and bow tie, entered the obscured chambers of the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning to kick off another jam-packed day for investigators.\n\nWith lawmakers returning to the Capitol after a two-week recess, Democratic leaders planned to huddle with their caucus Tuesday evening to update them on their work and to discuss the possibility of holding a floor vote to authorize their inquiry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far insisted the move was unnecessary, but Republicans and the White House have said it is a prerequisite to lend fairness and legitimacy to the process. Democratic leaders were privately gauging support among swing-district Democrats for a possible vote, according to three officials familiar with the outreach.\n\nSeparately, the committees leading the investigation had set a series of crucial deadlines on Tuesday for key witnesses and executive branch agencies to hand over relevant documents.\n\nMr. Kent\u2019s appearance came after an emerging pattern in which administration witnesses are instructed not to comply with the impeachment inquiry in line with a White House declaration last week that there would be a \u201cfull halt\u201d to any cooperation, but ultimately agree to do so. According to officials familiar with the investigation, the State Department directed Mr. Kent not to appear and sought to limit his testimony. The House Intelligence Committee then issued a last-minute subpoena ordering him to appear, and he complied.\n\nHe was the second top State Department official to do so in recent days. The first was Ms. Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump ordered removed from her ambassadorial post in May, but who is still a State Department employee. She answered questions from investigators on Friday, offering a blistering assessment of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy and saying she had been told Mr. Trump himself pressed for her ouster for months based on \u201cfalse claims\u201d by outsiders working for their own personal and political objectives.\n\nFiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, appeared on Monday under subpoena as well, and other current and former officials are expected to follow suit. Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to Europe who appears to be at the center of the pressure campaign, will meet investigators on Thursday.\n\nMr. Kent\u2019s warnings about the disinformation effort are reflected in internal State Department emails provided by the agency\u2019s inspector general to Congress this month and obtained by The New York Times. In one, he assailed a \u201cfake news smear\u201d being pushed against Ms. Yovanovitch by conservative media personalities allied with Mr. Trump. In another, he criticized the Ukrainian prosecutor who was pushing the claims about Ms. Yovanovitch and called them \u201ccomplete poppycock.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Doug Mills/The New York Times Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, at the White House.\n\nA career diplomat, Mr. Kent has served since last fall as the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. He has deep experience in Kiev, and with Ukrainian corruption specifically, having served as an anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau in 2014 and 2015, and then as deputy chief of mission in the United States embassy in Kiev from 2015 until 2018.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Trump, picking up a talking point from his Republican allies in Congress, accused Democrats of \u201callowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings,\u201d and said if Republicans tried to do the same thing \u201cthey would be excoriated by the Fake News.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for 9 hours each, not selective leaks,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning.\n\nImpeachment investigators thus far have been conducting their proceedings almost entirely in secret by holding staff-led witness depositions, or interviews, rather than public hearings. Republicans have seized on that approach as evidence that Democrats are trying to impeach the president out of public view.\n\nBut the tactic is not uncommon on Capitol Hill, at least in the early stages of an investigation. Senior House Democrats argue that conducting the interviews in private is a more efficient and effective form of fact-finding that avoids some of the spectacle of a public hearing and ensures that potential witnesses are not able to easily adjust their stories in ways that could mislead investigators. House aides during Watergate did something similar before holding public hearings related to whether to impeach Richard M. Nixon. Democrats say they, too, plan to publicly present their findings when they have sorted out what happened.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 reconsideration of bypassing a floor vote to authorize the inquiry appeared, at least in part, intended to undercut another Republican criticism. Although there is no requirement in the Constitution or the House rules that such a vote take place to make an impeachment inquiry official, the president\u2019s allies have continuously accused Democrats of deviating from the precedent set in modern presidential impeachments and denying Mr. Trump and Republicans a say in the process.\n\nHolding a vote could also help Democrats in continuing court fights over access to investigative materials they seek. But it presents some political risk for them, as well. Democratic leaders\u2019 outreach to politically vulnerable members suggests they are concerned about how such a vote would affect them.\n\nInvestigators were waiting to see if the Trump administration and key witnesses in the case would produce documents related to Mr. Trump\u2019s conversations with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the decision to withhold $391 million in security aid for Ukraine this summer, and other matters. Those already under subpoena to produce the material include the Office of Management and Budget, the Defense Department and Mr. Giuliani. Vice President Mike Pence also faces a deadline to hand over a vast set of records voluntarily, or face a subpoena.\n\nThe deadlines force each department or witness to decide between the demands of Congress and the White House\u2019s direction not to cooperate with the House\u2019s work. Seeking to tip the scales in favor of cooperation, Democrats have warned that not doing so will be considered obstruction of their impeachment inquiry, behavior worthy of its own impeachment article against Mr. Trump.\n\nNew requests for depositions continued to stack up. The committees wrote on Friday to two top officials at the White House budget office, requesting they appear next week to discuss the suspension of the security aid, according to one of the officials. They targeted Russ Vought, the office\u2019s acting director, and Michael Duffey, a senior Trump appointee there who was said to have helped approve orders freezing the funds. The letters to the men said merely that investigators believed they had \u201cinformation relevant to these matters.\u201d\n\nMr. Kent was believed to have special insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine, but he was also deeply involved in previous efforts to persuade the country to investigate corruption. In his earlier roles, Mr. Kent had aggressively pushed Ukrainian prosecutors to pursue investigations into Mykola Zlochevsky, an oligarch who owned a gas company that started paying Hunter Biden, the presidential candidate\u2019s son, as a board member in 2014.\n\nWhen a British case against Mr. Zlochevsky for money laundering was dismissed in January 2015 for lack of evidence, Mr. Kent and others in the State Department blamed Ukrainian prosecutors. The Ukrainian prosecutors had refused to provide evidence to British prosecutors, Mr. Kent told associates, because they and other officials were being paid off by Mr. Zlochevsky or his allies.\n\nTensions boiled over at a previously unreported meeting in early February 2015 in Kiev, in which Mr. Kent scolded a deputy prosecutor in the office of Vitaly Yarema, who was the general prosecutor of Ukraine \u2014 the nation\u2019s top law enforcement post, similar to that of the attorney general of the United States.\n\nAccording to a Ukrainian and an American with knowledge of the meeting, Mr. Kent demanded of the deputy prosecutor, \u201cWho took the bribe and how much was it?\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian deputy replied \u2014 perhaps jokingly \u2014 that a $7 million bribe had been paid just before Mr. Yarema\u2019s taking the office.\n\nThe F.B.I. looked into the bribe allegation, according to people familiar with it, but \u2014 as is common in the world of Ukrainian corruption investigations \u2014 the inquiry stalled amid a tangled web of contradictory and evolving stories.\n\nIn the days after the heated meeting with Mr. Kent, Mr. Yarema was fired and eventually replaced by another prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whom American officials came to view as similarly problematic.\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden in 2016 successfully pushed for Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster because the Obama administration and other Western governments and international institutions contended he was turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the country\u2019s elite, including Mr. Zlochevsky.\n\nIt was Mr. Biden\u2019s role in the dismissal of Mr. Shokin that has subsequently been held up by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani as evidence that the former vice president intervened in Ukrainian affairs to help his son. There is no evidence of that.\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.", "description": "George P.
