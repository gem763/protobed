The US subsequently conducted a missile test that would have been forbidden under the treaty.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a few dos and don'ts that citizens should remember in case a nuclear explosion were to take place. One practice to avoid at all costs is using conditioner in your hair, since conditioner can act like a glue between your hair and radioactive material.\n\nRinsing with a gentle shampoo, on the other hand, is a critical part of the decontamination process. A few differences between the ingredients in shampoo and conditioner make one a life-saving tool and the other a dangerous agent in the wake of an explosion.\n\nRead more: If a nuclear bomb explodes nearby, here's why you should never, ever get in a car\n\nNuclear explosions release radioactive dust that could land in hair\n\nnuclear explosion fire More\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nNuclear explosions afford people little time to seek shelter. Within about a tenth of a second after an explosion, the sky is overtaken by a brilliant flash of light and a giant orange fireball. The blast also emits shockwaves that can topple buildings, along with sweltering temperatures that can burn skin and ignite fires.\n\nThose closest to the bomb face death, while people up to 5 miles away could endure third-degree burns. Even those up to 53 miles away could experience temporary blindness.\n\nBut a longer term threat comes in the minutes and hours after an explosion: Nuclear blasts can produce clouds of radioactive dust and ash that disperse into the atmosphere \u2014 that's nuclear fallout. These particles can land in your skin and hair, exposing you to radiation poisoning, which damages the body's cells and can prove fatal.\n\nUse shampoo but not conditioner following a nuclear explosion\n\nIf you find yourself outside during a nuclear explosion, the CDC recommends seeking shelter immediately in the nearest brick or concrete building.
