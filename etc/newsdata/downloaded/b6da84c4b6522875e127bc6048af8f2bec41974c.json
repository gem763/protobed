Even before the rough transcript of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released, we knew that the administration had prematurely curtailed the appointment of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch following public attacks on her by the president\u2019s eldest son and by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Administration officials then falsely claimed that she was leaving her post \u201cas planned.\u201d Now, we also know that Trump went on to denigrate the ambassador in a phone call to a foreign leader, telling Zelensky that \u201cthe woman\u201d was \u201cbad news\u201d and vaguely but ominously noting that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nPresidents are entitled to have their own ambassadors in place and to expect those ambassadors to implement their policies. But the consequences of Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to punish a top U.S. representative, and to disparage her in a conversation with a foreign government, should not be underestimated. Allowing this to stand would not only have a chilling effect on the entire diplomatic corps but also could undermine U.S. foreign policy more broadly.", "description": "", "authors": ["Gordon", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions The-Other-Ukraine-Scandal-Trumps-Threats-To-Our-Ambassador-Who-Wouldnt-Bend"], "top_image": ""}
