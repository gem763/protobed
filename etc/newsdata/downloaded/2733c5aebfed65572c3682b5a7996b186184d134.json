From Britain to Australia, Japan to Saudi Arabia, foreign leaders who decided to gamble on America\u2019s unpredictable leader are probably wondering whether they made a losing bet.\n\nIn the United States, the ongoing scandal about President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked a swell of momentum for impeachment. Democrats argue that the phone call, in which Trump said Zelensky should open a criminal investigation against the son of one of his rivals, amounted to an abuse of office.\n\nBut there was more than one world leader on that phone call. Some critics in Ukraine have condemned Zelensky\u2019s attempts to placate Trump during the conversation. \u201cNow we\u2019re a part of American elections, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of former president Petro Poroshenko\u2019s party, told The Washington Post. \u201cUkraine has problems enough without this.\u201d\n\nZelensky, who like Trump is a political novice who made his name on a television show, appears to be weathering the criticism so far. But the scandal over Trump\u2019s private conversation with Zelensky has sparked further scrutiny of interactions between the Trump administration and other Trump-friendly foreign allies.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William P. Barr has been pressing foreign allies such as Britain, Australia and Italy for information that could discredit U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nThere have been reports that Trump pushed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for information. Johnson and Morrison had endeavored to maintain good relations with Trump, but in both countries, the American president is an unpopular figure. According to Pew, last year just 32 percent of Australians and 28 percent of Britons said they had confidence in Trump.\n\nAppearing subservient to such an unpopular figure carries real political risk for any foreign ally \u2014 particularly in Britain, Australia and Italy, where the governments are already struggling with their own instability and questions of legitimacy.\n\nPM Morrison was asked by President Trump to help him discredit his political enemies. Morrison was ready to \u201cassist and co-operate\u201d. My criticism of Scott Morrison failing to pursue Australia\u2019s national interest is even more relevant this morning\u2026 pic.twitter.com/iehnrQkWTE \u2014 Peter Khalil MP (@PeterKhalilMP) October 1, 2019\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the foreign travels of Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that should worry foreign allies. The president\u2019s abrupt policy reversals and tendency to alternate between flattery and threats have recently left some allies wondering when their own luck would run out.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of the Trump administration\u2019s earliest and most enthusiastic foreign supporters, have found themselves caught between the U.S. president\u2019s willingness to risk a conflict with Iran and his eagerness for a summit with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful young crown prince, recently edged away from support for a military confrontation with Iran; an Iranian government spokesman said Monday that Saudi Arabia had sent messages to Iran\u2019s president through the leader of another country. These moves follow the UAE\u2019s decision to pull back from the war in Yemen, where it fights the Iranian-backed Houthis.\n\nBoth Riyadh and Abu Dhabi courted the Trump administration with geopolitical support and U.S.-friendly business arrangements, but when push came to shove \u2014 such as in the case of the attack on Saudi oil facilities last month \u2014 it became clear that they have far more to lose than the United States in the dispute with Iran.\n\nA similar situation is playing out farther east, where South Korea and Japan are both simultaneously disappointed with Trump\u2019s negotiations with North Korea \u2014 albeit for opposite reasons. A ballistic-missile launch by North Korea on Wednesday, possibly from a submarine, could only heighten a sense of worry for both nations, with Washington-Pyongyang talks expected to resume this weekend.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing Trump to maintain a hard-line approach to North Korea, with little success. North Korea is still testing missiles, and Wednesday\u2019s launch fell into Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. South Korean President Moon Jae-in had pushed for talks, but the seemingly intractable dispute over U.S. sanctions and North Korean denuclearization, combined with his country\u2019s own national security concerns, has helped cut his approval rating in half.\n\nGood prediction, it turns out. https://t.co/HdOSNHmjja \u2014 Joshua H. Pollack (@Joshua_Pollack) October 1, 2019\n\nEven Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Trumpian a Trump ally as there ever was, has found that the American leader\u2019s friendship may be fleeting. Netanyahu has watched Trump\u2019s outreach to Iran with unease and, as his own domestic political pressures mounted, seen Trump distance himself from him. \u201cOur relations are with Israel, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told reporters last month after Israel\u2019s close election result.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame foreign nations for trying to ally themselves with Trump. The United States remains the most powerful country in the world. One way or another, all world leaders have to deal with the president, and it makes sense to try to do it while on friendly terms.\n\nTaking a confrontational stance can hurt, too: Trump is likely to hit the European Union, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire, with tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of E.U. exports annually after a World Trade Organization ruling Wednesday. Foreign leaders who have stood up to Trump, such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are suffering their own domestic problems anyway.\n\nSome rivals to the United States have ultimately given up on engagement with the Trump administration. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said over the weekend that the release of the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s confidential conversation with Zelensky showed the risks of talks with the United States.\n\nChina, a foreign-policy foe that recently moved to a policy of waiting out the Trump administration rather than trying to engage with it, may end up one of the winners of the scandals engulfing Trump. Analysts say the impeachment pressure on Trump could prompt him to accept an \u201cimperfect deal,\u201d according to a report by Hussein Sayed of the foreign exchange brokerage FXTM.\n\nBeijing wagered that Trump would end his first term in a state of weakness. That\u2019s looking like a wiser bet with each day.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
