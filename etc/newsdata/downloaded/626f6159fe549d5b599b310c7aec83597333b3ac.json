Here are a few:\n\nThe whistle-blower gets right to the point.\n\nWe know right away what his purpose is and why we should care. He wastes no time on background or pleasantries before stating that he is writing to report \u201can \u2018urgent\u2019 concern.\u201d And then he immediately states it:\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nThe whistle-blower uses subheadings to make sure we can connect the dots.\n\nMost subheadings don\u2019t do much to enhance a document. The whistle-blower\u2019s subheadings do what the best subheadings do: They structure the complaint and provide a clear outline of what the document contains:\n\nI. The 25 July Presidential phone call\n\nII. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call\n\nIII. Ongoing concerns\n\nIV. Circumstances leading up to the 25 July Presidential phone call", "description": "His complaint offers lessons on how to make a point.", "authors": ["Jane Rosenzweig"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27rozensweig/27rozensweig-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
