If they're not authorized, they're not authorized and we would expect them not to be taking authorized business.\"\n\nSibley said most larger entities -- which include Barclays (L: ) and Bank of America (N: ) who have set up EU headquarters in the Irish capital -- are pretty much all approved, with \"maybe one or two exceptions\".\n\nEven with the influx, Sibley said he was confident no-deal preparations were in place across Ireland's varied international financial services sector and that the system as a whole is robust enough to cope if Britain leaves without the cushion of a divorce agreement and a transition period.\n\nIreland is considered the remaining EU member most exposed to such an outcome, from the implications for its currently seamless border with British-run Northern Ireland to tightly intertwined trade with its nearest neighbor.\n\n\"The way I look at it is, given the kind of macro, political, societal impacts of Brexit on Ireland, it's really important that the financial services system a) isn't adding to the woes and b) continues to be there to support the business and the people who will require support after Oct. 31,\" Sibley said.\n\n\"So from a system wide level, the shock will be significant enough but manageable.\"\n\nHe said Ireland's retail banks -- which required the euro zone's most expensive bailout after the 2008-09 financial crisis -- were far more resilient a decade later from a funding governance, control and risk management perspective.\n\nRegulators are pretty confident the banks will be ready operationally, he said, but an unruly Brexit will hurt a sector now almost wholly focused on the domestic market.\n\n\"I wouldn't be concerned that we will have an overnight problem, it isn't going to cause a massive financial stability problem. But it will be difficult for them, it will be damaging for the economy,\" he said.\n\nSibley added that he has not seen any evidence to suggest changes were required in an upcoming annual review of the central bank's mortgage lending limits, one of the measures put in place in recent years to increase that resilience.", "description": "Irish central bank's Brexit authorizations top 100", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF811K2_L.jpg"}
