We remain willing and open to examine any such proposals that meet all the objectives of the backstop.\u201d\n\nIn a television clip, Barclay said there was a \u201ccommon purpose\u201d in Dublin, London and Brussels to \u201cget a deal over the line.\u201d\n\nThe response from the EU was as expected, and Barclay had noted in his speech that Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne had demanded a workable solution by the end of September. Downing Street said it would not be bound by an \u201cartificial deadline.\u201d\n\nTechnical teams will meet again next week, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to meet European Council President Donald Tusk at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.", "description": "The EU said a workable solution to the backstop was \u2018essential\u2019 as part of a withdrawal deal, not after.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169765165-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
