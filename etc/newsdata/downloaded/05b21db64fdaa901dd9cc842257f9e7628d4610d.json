Xi met Pakistani PM Imran Khan and reiterated Beijing\u2019s support to Islamabad to safeguard the latter\u2019s interests. In fact, the joint press release from the meeting says that the Kashmir issue should be resolved based on the UN charter, relevant UNSC resolutions and bilateral pacts. India reacted by reaffirming that J&K is an integral part of India and it is not for other countries to comment on the matter.\n\nIt is clear that the atmosphere for the Modi-Xi meet is far from ideal. China\u2019s support for Pakistan on the Kashmir issue has put a big strain on New Delhi-Beijing ties. The Indian side had already expressed its displeasure by putting off the visit of Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. And that the official announcement of the informal summit came so late shows that both sides are sticking to their guns.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that China today is India\u2019s biggest strategic challenge. Beijing wants to have it both ways. It wants to support Pakistan despite its sponsorship of anti-India terror and yet exploit India\u2019s vast market. This, however, won\u2019t do. China needs to make plain whether it stands with India or Pakistan on terrorism. If it wants cordial relations with New Delhi then it must put pressure on Islamabad for sheltering anti-India terrorists. It can\u2019t sidestep the matter. China today is Pakistan\u2019s biggest ally. Therefore, it too shares the blame for Pakistan\u2019s tactic of using terror as an instrument of state policy. India, therefore, must stay firm and force China to choose between ties with Islamabad and cordial relations with itself.", "description": "Although the second informal summit between PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping has finally been confirmed, both sides are talking tough on Kashmir.
