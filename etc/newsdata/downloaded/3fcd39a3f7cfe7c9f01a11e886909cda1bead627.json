Instead, echoing recent polling, the move toward impeachment appears only to have widened the existing partisan divide \u2014 and plunged the Democrats who ran on rising above it straight into the split\u2026\n\nFaced with a more evenly divided crowd in Michigan on Thursday, Slotkin explained her decision to support the impeachment probe \u2014 as Trump supporters challenged her interpretation of the Zelensky phone call, questioned whether former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter ought to be investigated, and pressed the former CIA officer on whether she knows the whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine inquiry. (She does not.)\n\nOnly once \u2014 after one constituent suggested that Trump \u201ccan\u2019t trust the FBI or the CIA right now\u201d \u2014 did Slotkin flash impatience: \u201cI know exactly what those people are doing, risking their life every day alongside our military. And, frankly, I have a hard time hearing that, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics For-House-Democrats-Impeachment-Probe-Widens-The-Divide-They-Hoped-To-Bridge"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
