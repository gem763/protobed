The man cannot hear and yet he has done wonders for India inside the wrestling ring. Goonga Pehelwan was a documentary made on his life and why not?

Now those are a lot of medals.\n\nFB\n\nHe was born into a farmer's family in Haryana and has not been able to hear since he was a kid. As a deaf child he was bullied in his village before his father and uncle took him to Delhi to train as a wrestler as the sport was their family tradition. His talent was evident and Virender slowly began to improve his skills.\n\nThe National Rounds of the World Cadet Wrestling Championships in 2002 saw him win gold. Sadly he could qualify because of his deafness though officially he should not have been barred from the international event. Nonetheless he did not lose heart and in 2005 took part in the Deaflympics and won his first gold.\n\nDon't Miss 123 SHARES 912 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES 410 SHARES\n\nFB\n\nThere was no looking back as medals followed and by 2017 he had won a lot of laurels for India.
