That\u2019s right: In all things Succession, there is Gerri, Waystar Royco\u2019s general counsel.\n\nPlayed with poisonous efficiency by J. Smith-Cameron, Gerri survives the chaos primarily by staying out of it. In the show\u2019s second season, however, Gerri can\u2019t resist getting drawn into the Waystar Royco power struggles, as she\u2019s temporarily placed in charge of the company (a position she accepts with a sense of trepidation), and also gets caught up in a sexually-charged, mentor-like relationship with Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), the family\u2019s most chaotic son. Gerri pushes Roman to get a job at a Waystar theme park and clean up his act, and in the fourth episode, after Roman gets into a fight with his girlfriend over the fact that they don\u2019t have sex, Gerri and Roman end up stumbling into phone sex together. Which, in the world of Succession, means that he jacks off while she berates him for being \u201ca revolting little worm\u201d and a \u201clittle slime puppy.\u201d\n\nSmith-Cameron, a TV and theater actor who\u2019s worked with Culkin a lot in the past (including in her husband Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s film Margaret as well as onstage), was as surprised as everyone else by Gerri and Roman\u2019s phone sex, though she also admits it makes a certain sense. Vulture caught up with her \u2014 over the phone, of course \u2014 to discuss what\u2019s going through Gerri\u2019s mind during that scene, how she imagines Gerri\u2019s backstory, and why she\u2019s managed to survive at Waystar for so long.\n\nAt the end of this episode, Gerri and Roman have very charged, very unexpected phone sex. How did you initially react to that scene?\n\nWell, I was totally shocked. In episode one, I remember [director] Mark Mylod saying, \u201cLean into Roman, a little foreshadowing.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat foreshadowing?\u201d And he went, \u201cOh, has no one told you about that?\u201d Then he said, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s gonna be something.\u201d Kieran and I have known each other a long time. We have a good rapport on set. Gerri and Roman also have, somehow, a good rapport because [she] can just tell him to shut up all the time, you know? He maybe respects that or enjoys that in some roundabout way. But it\u2019s still very, very weird!\n\nI was rewatching the first season and I was surprised by how much it\u2019s foreshadowed. Early on, Gerri has a line about how Roman \u201cknows how to flirt\u201d with her.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for Kieran, but I think there\u2019s something in Roman\u2019s makeup that admires the way Gerri has power even in the midst of dealing with Logan. She keeps her boat afloat and that\u2019s not lost in him. He finds that appealing.\n\nWhat do you think she gets out of it? It feels like a way for her to exert authority amidst the chaos.\n\nIntellectually, it\u2019s that, but I don\u2019t know. I was watching episode three last night, where they\u2019re in Hungary and they\u2019d been to that horrible night of \u201cboar on the floor\u201d and they\u2019re all hung over. Gerri comes to get [Roman] because he\u2019s late for breakfast, and there\u2019s an undeniable fondness or intimacy there. It was on the page, but it also just was true. It just happened in the room. I don\u2019t think, at that point, Gerri would ever guess where it was going. I think she is fond of him and would like to think of him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or something. She thinks, Oh, he\u2019s not stupid. And he\u2019s very charismatic. He\u2019s just a restless spoiled brat. If the right person could fashion that, he\u2019d be really an amazing person.\n\nBut that\u2019s a distant thought, because I don\u2019t think she has very high hopes for the Roys. I feel like Gerri is like, \u201cOh brother,\u201d about all three of the sons, all the time. But some kind of rapport is there. I don\u2019t think she knows what to make of it. Every time we went to shoot one of those scenes, I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It finally occurred to me that Gerri doesn\u2019t know either. She\u2019s just playing it moment to moment, like, \u201cWhat? Okay. What?\u201d\n\nA lot of Gerri\u2019s scenes involve her observing these Roy power struggles, then reacting to whatever\u2019s happening. What is it like to film that?\n\nIt\u2019s really fun. She\u2019s in the center of the company, but not being born a Roy, there\u2019s some layer of privilege she can\u2019t access. But there\u2019s some sanity that she can always access because she\u2019s not caught up in that above-the-law feeling. So she does bide her time. She does carefully choose her words.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Gerri is morally superior at all, by the way. She\u2019s a way for the audience to see someone who\u2019s not just flexing their incredible power of being born into this. I sometimes wonder, Why in the world would anyone choose to work there?, but I imagine people get addicted. It\u2019s like an extreme sport. Will I get dunked by this wave or will I come out on top?\n\nAt the beginning of this season, Gerri is ostensibly put in charge of the company, even as Logan insists that she won\u2019t be his successor. Should we be worried for her, considering how unstable the company is?\n\nLast year, my first scene I shot was when Roman asked me to do that job. Logan had his stroke and he went to the hospital and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat?\u201d You later find out that Gerri knows how much debt they\u2019re in, so I think she never had the fantasy about running the business. She does not want to inherit it at a moment when whoever has it is bound to fail because it\u2019s going to be in really treacherous waters. This season, she\u2019s not in the chosen [group]. She\u2019s not quite in sync with it all. She\u2019s staying alive in the game, but it\u2019s not really quite exactly going her way.\n\nYou talked about working with Kieran in the past. Between you, him, and Jeannie Berlin, who plays ATN boss Cyd Peach, there\u2019s a whole Margaret reunion happening this second season.\n\nThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s a joy. Jeannie and I had more to say to each other than what made the cut, but I don\u2019t want to give it away because it could be used still.\n\nKieran\u2019s been in a number of my husband\u2019s plays as well as Margaret. I\u2019ve gotten to know him over a long the time. I feel like it did really inform the Gerri-Roman thing, our history. It makes for this shorthand you have with someone. A lot of the things that turned out to be true of Gerri, which weren\u2019t written in stone to begin with, they evolved as a combination of the writers and me and the mood on set. It\u2019s our past, but it\u2019s also the way my character evolved into a niche in sync with his character. It\u2019s like the beginning of a beautiful friendship, like they\u2019re like partners in crime.", "description": "J.
