There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTrump's statements follow comments made earlier by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, pinning the blame on Iran for the Saturday attacks, which shut down production on roughly 5% of the world's daily production of crude oil, equal to about 5 million barrels.\n\n\"Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,\" he said in a tweet on Saturday.\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nThe strike was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebel group, who said they used drones to set the two major oil facilities ablaze. But Saudi and US officials have cast doubt on that narrative, stating that evidence suggests that the attack was launched from Iran.\n\nA senior US official told media, including Reuters, that evidence indicated the attack was launched from west-northwest of the facilities, the direction of Iran. The official added that Saudi officials suggested that those responsible may have used cruise missiles to launch the attack.\n\n\"There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,\" Pompeo said in his tweet. He also called on global leaders to \"publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks.\"\n\n\"The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\" he wrote in a follow-up tweet.\n\nIran says it's prepared for a 'full-fledged war'\n\nTehran has denied allegations that it orchestrated the attack. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Sunday that Pompeo's statements were \"obscure and meaningless\" for diplomatic progress, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\nThe agency also quoted a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander as saying that the country was prepared for a \"full-fledged war.\"\n\n\"Everybody should know that all American bases and their vessels in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers [from Iran borders] are within the range of our missiles,\" General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said on Saturday.\n\nOil prices on Monday skyrocketed to their highest levels in six months, according to Reuters, while US crude futures climbed 15%.\n\nWhite House Adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but told Fox News Sunday that recent attacks \"did not help\" prospects. She added that the administration was keeping \"many options on the table\" in regards to potential retaliation.\n\n\"This president and his national security team keep many options on the table particularly when it comes to retaliating against malign behaviour,\" she said.\n\nTrump on Sunday night tweeted that news suggesting that he would be willing to meet with Iran with \"no conditions\" was \"fake news.\"", "description": "Iran has denied allegations that it was behind the attack and a senior Iranian military official said the country was prepared for a \"full-fledged war.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5544/1a998904ef6b44e2bdb00d7032a1757c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
