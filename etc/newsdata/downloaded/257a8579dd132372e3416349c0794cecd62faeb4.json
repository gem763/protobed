The deal includes a capital raising of $150 million.\n\nThe stock last traded at $3.91 on Friday. It has drifted lower from $4.29 a year ago because of softer trading conditions in some of its tourist ferry operations and a slowdown in the number of Chinese tourists arriving in Australia.\n\nBut the company has generated a handsome increase in share price value since listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2013 with an issue price of $1.10.\n\nTransit Systems operates brands including Swan Transit in Perth and Torrens Transit in Adelaide. Torrens Tansit runs about 700 buses and has a staff of 1200 people after the South Australian Government privatised a large portion of Adelaide's bus services in 2000. The spotlight on privatisation has just re-emerged in South Australia with the government of Premier Steven Marshall announcing in July it would privatise the operations of the metropolitan train and tram network.\n\nMr Ellison studied accountancy at the University of South Australia and his first job was at a small North Adelaide accounting firm called Hinks and Smith.\n\nBut he became frustrated at clients not heeding his advice and wanted to roll up his sleeves and run a business himself. \"The clients often didn't follow through,\" he told The Australian Financial Review earlier this year in an interview.\n\nHe joined SeaLink 28 years ago, became chief financial officer, and then was promoted to chief executive 21 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April this year Mr Ellison hinted that the new chief executive was likely to come from outside the group, because internal candidates possibly needed more time to build up extra experience and put more runs on the board.\n\n\"It's unlikely to be internal. If I was going to stay another five years it might have been,\" he said at the time.\n\nMr Ellison is also a board member of Tourism Australia.\n\nLucy Turnbull, wife of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, was on the board of SeaLink for its first two years as a listed entity, but she resigned as deputy chairwoman in October 2015 because of increasing commitments associated with her husband becoming prime minister.", "description": "One of the longest-serving CEOs in corporate Australia is set to bow out after 21 years, in the SeaLink buyout of Transit Systems", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9698%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_277%2C$y_231/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bfc23a4b77ec087031992663b051d94df2cd3a7d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
