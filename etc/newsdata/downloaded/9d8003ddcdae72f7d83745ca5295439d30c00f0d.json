But the film then jumps ahead in time, to Nadine Collier\u2019s kitchen in Charleston, South Carolina, as she whips steamed yams into sweet potato pie for her church, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal. Four years earlier, Collier\u2019s mother, Ethel Lance, was killed when a white supremacist gunman opened fire after Bible study, killing nine black parishioners. The crime was an act of racial hatred so brutal, a violation of a sacred place so inhumane, that it shocked a nation already growing inured to the crushing pattern of mass shootings.\n\nAlways in Season: behind the painful film about lynching in America Read more\n\nThe headlines regenerated days later, when several family members of the victims, including Collier, tearfully forgave the shooter at his bond hearing \u2013 a narrative of forgiveness controversially seized upon by the press as a feel-better cover for looking critically at the deep roots of racism in Charleston and beyond. (At the time, the Confederate flag still flew above the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia. Three weeks after the shooting, the then governor, Nikki Haley, ordered it removed and placed in a nearby Confederate museum).\n\nThe film Emanuel, produced by the basketball superstar Stephen Curry and Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis, takes the news blare of the tragedy and the intense outside focus on forgiveness into account, then zooms in closely to look at church, community and family: the victims\u2019 relationships to the church, and how they loved. Why the families forgave, or did not, and still have not. The film features at least one representative for each victim, as well as numerous voices speaking to the history and culture of Charleston \u2013 journalists, local newscasters, activists, historians and religious community members.\n\nIt\u2019s also an unabashedly Christian film, told from the perspective of a director, film-making team and cast deeply invested in their church and the Christian precept of forgiveness. But director Brian Ivie maintains that it holds lessons for a wider audience. \u201cThe hope of the film is that it would show who these people are and what they believe, but it will also show how much work we have to do. And I think those things can coexist,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nIvie is perhaps not the most obvious choice to direct a documentary on the shooting at Emanuel. A white man from California, he was on his honeymoon when he received news of the tragedy. \u201cTo be honest, I never wanted to make a movie about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like it was the most inappropriate thing to do,\u201d given the media crush to cover the immediate aftermath. His unease was compounded by the intense focus on forgiveness, which \u201cstarted to Christianize the situation in a way that I know hurt a lot of people and forced a lot of people into an expedited healing process that wasn\u2019t necessarily healthy\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, as a white American, it certainly didn\u2019t feel like it was my place to go document the story, even to grieve \u2013 what role would I serve in that?\u201d Ivie avoided the story for a year, but changed tune when he flew to Charleston to film the first annual memorial service as a gift to AME Emanuel. His producing partner, Dimas Salaberrios, an African American pastor from New York City, connected him with several victims\u2019 family members, which began discussions of a potential film.\n\nPeople were \u201crightfully\u201d skeptical at the beginning, said Ivie, but he credited two promises in earning their trust. First, that they would not profit in any way from the film. Second, that they would honor the faith of their loved ones. \u201cKnowing that I shared their faith,\u201d said Ivie, \u201cI think that made them feel comfortable \u2013 that I was going to honor the legacy of faith of their families, which was very important to them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nadine Collier remembers her mother, Ethel Lance.

Not can I make this,\u201d he said. Those questions formed \u201ca process we went through with the families: do you want this to exist? Is this something that honors you and your loved ones, or not?\u201d\n\nEmanuel also includes many local experts \u2013 journalists, local newscasters, historians, a Black Lives Matter activist \u2013 to address the city\u2019s thicket of racism both past and present. The racial context of the tragedy, beyond the hate crime itself \u2013 Charleston\u2019s history as America\u2019s pre-eminent slave port, the terrorism of lynching in the south, the solace provided by black churches, particularly Emanuel \u2013 was crucial to the film. \u201cI wanted it to feel like we were not only humanizing people but also giving them a voice to talk about the pain and injustice and marginalization and disenfranchisement and evil that has been done to African Americans for centuries,\u201d said Ivie. \u201cI felt like that was the only way that the film deserved to exist.\u201d\n\nWhile the film explicitly discusses racism, Emanuel refrains from specifically addressing gun control. Ivie said he personally supports gun reform and the organization Everytown for Gun Safety, but backed away from politics in the film in deference to the families. \u201cUltimately, it felt like we were moving away from what the film needed to be for [the families], so that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t the focal point,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the film\u2019s most moving moments, however, comes again through the presence of Barack Obama, who delivered the eulogy to one of the victims, the Rev Clementa Pinckney. At one point in his speech, the then president pauses, seemingly at a loss of what to do next, how to adequately express this level of pain, or faint possibility of hope. Then he begins to sing Amazing Grace, soon joined by the pastors behind him, then the whole room.\n\nThe decision to devote significant time to Obama\u2019s speech has received \u201ca lot of flak\u201d, Ivie said. \u201cI mean, the Christian community is very divided.\u201d But it\u2019s part of the story on the ground, \u201cand I felt like that was a moment that brought the nation together in the right way\u201d.\n\nThe final moments of the film, though, belong to the families, each paying tribute to their loved ones lost four years ago at church: Clementa C Pinckney, Cynthia Marie Graham Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel L Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson. Their memories were integral to Davis and Curry\u2019s support of the project, said Ivie. \u201cThat was their heart, to make sure the world didn\u2019t forget about these people and why they died \u2013 and also why they lived.\u201d", "description": "Produced by Stephen Curry and Viola Davis, the film allows the family members of those killed in the 2015 shooting to speak about love, loss and faith", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db7f94a9382f61579640a3f5030420cbc59704cf/735_0_3557_2135/master/3557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61cee98c09d0b4244fead4d74b635765", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
