WeWork has come under withering fire in media, startup, and financial circles for paying its CEO for use of a trademark; the deal looked like self-dealing from a CEO with voting control of his company. And the company has endured general censure for filing to go public with an all-male board. (Axios reported on the updates earlier in the day, alerting Crunchbase News to the filing.)\n\nThat it had the poor judgment to get all the way to an IPO without any women on its board was inexcusable.\n\nThat the company agreed to pay Neumann $5.9 million in \u201cconsideration\u201d for assigning \u201crights\u201d to the \u201cwe\u201d trademarks that he controlled through his own side-corporation was a massive optical error. That it had the poor judgment to get all the way to an IPO without any women on its board was inexcusable.\n\nFixing both is good, even if the money (\u201cthe issuance [\u2026] of the partnership interests was unwound and the partnership interests were returned to the We Company Partnership\u201d) should never have been paid, and appointing a woman to the board after the IPO smacks of window-dressing and general ignorance.\n\nIf the markets will decide that the company\u2019s sense of judgement is improving isn\u2019t yet clear, even if the moves are steps in the right direction.\n\nLooming Obfuscation\n\nIt\u2019s old-hat now to point out that WeWork\u2019s business model is hard to parse from its S-1 filing. That its real cost of revenue is hard to nail down, that its adjusted profit metrics are confusing, and that it is hard to tease out growth costs from operating costs.\n\nThis makes the potential profit of its long-term model hard to grok. And if you can\u2019t estimate a firm\u2019s future profits, how can you value it?\n\nWeWork\u2019s financials will be the deciding factors regarding the firm\u2019s IPO potential success or failure. But you can\u2019t help but wonder if the company would be able to extract more goodwill\u2014faith, even\u2014from investors if it hadn\u2019t committed its unforced errors.\n\nRecall that Neumann also sold blocks of shares ahead of the IPO and borrowed against others. This allowed him to buy real estate that he later leased to the company, leading to some cries of double-dipping. (See also: The trademark issue.)\n\nWeWork could be spending its time arguing about the long-term value it can extract from its mature buildings. Instead, it\u2019s promising to appoint a woman to its board at a later date and retracting a $5.9 million payment to its CEO who, through a separate company, charged his own company for use of a trademark that he owned. This is not where you want to be if you are working to go public whilst defending a high valuation.\n\nThere are more important things going on today (Hong Kong\u2019s leader just withdrew the extradition bill, Boris Johnson is getting the whacking that he\u2019s long deserved after losing his majority, and Hurricane Dorian is nearing the Carolinas as we type), but in our little pond of private companies and private capital, this is the feature event.\n\nMore when WeWork sets a price range.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Wilhelm"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MMfeature.jpg"}
