(AP) \u2014 A former Georgia police officer who fatally shot a fleeing, unarmed black man was acquitted Saturday of voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThe jury, however, found Zechariah Presley guilty of violating his oath of office in the 2018 shooting of Tony Green, 33, in coastal Camden County near the Georgia-Florida state line.\n\nPresley was ordered to be jailed pending sentencing Oct. 18. He faces a prison term of one to five years.\n\nPresley sat silently at the defense table. Green\u2019s relatives wiped away tears after the verdict was read.\n\nPastor Mack De\u2019Von Knight, whose church Green attended, denounced the acquittals outside the courthouse, saying the evidence was \u201copen and shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe admitted that he killed Tony Green in cold blood,\u201d Knight said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s hunting season for the young black man and we\u2019re being gunned down in the streets and there\u2019s no repercussions, there\u2019s no consequences for these officers.\u201d\n\nThough Presley\u2019s body camera recorded his fatal encounter with Green, darkness and something covering the camera lens obscured the shooting and the moments leading up to it. That left the jury to weigh Presley\u2019s court testimony recalling what had occurred with a sometimes conflicting account by prosecutors and investigators.\n\nPresley said he followed Green\u2019s car on the night of June 20, 2018, because he believed Green was driving with a suspended license. Dash camera video showed Green drive the car off the road, then open the door and run. He briefly returned to the vehicle to grab an unseen object, then fled again.\n\nPresley chased Green on foot down a darkened street. A short struggle followed that\u2019s not visible on the video. The recording picked up the electrified clicking sound from Presley\u2019s Taser, followed by eight gunshots.\n\nAnother officer arrives afterward to find Presley lying on the ground. Presley says Green had been on top of him, trying to grab his Taser. Presley then says: \u201cAnd then I was going for my gun, and he started taking off. And I fired.\u201d\n\nAn autopsy found Green was struck by eight bullets \u2014 one to his chest, the rest to his back and hips. Green also had small amounts of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and a tranquilizer in his system.\n\nOn the witness stand Wednesday, Presley added details he had not mentioned previously. He said he opened fire after Green turned back to face him and extended an arm, saying he feared Green had a gun. Investigators determined the object in his hand was a cellphone.\n\nPresley\u2019s attorneys argued the shooting was justified because Presley believed his life was in danger.\n\n\u201cTony Green was not shot because of misdemeanor offenses,\u201d defense attorney Adrienne Browning said in her closing argument Thursday. \u201cHe was shot because of bad decision after bad decision, until the threat was overwhelming and Zech feared for his life.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said jurors shouldn\u2019t believe the revised account of the shooting Presley gave in court.\n\n\u201cHe made a fatal mistake and it was a mistake that cost a man his life,\u201d prosecutor Rocky Bridges said of Presley in his closing argument. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like Tony Green. \u2026 He ran from the police, not a good decision. But he was not armed. He did not turn on officer Presley. He did not deserve to die.\u201d\n\nThe shooting of a black man by a white officer sparked protests by Green\u2019s relatives and other black residents of Kingsland. They argued a manslaughter charge wasn\u2019t severe enough for Presley, who was fired after the shooting. The grand jury that indicted Presley rejected charging him with murder.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Tony Green was 33, not 31, when he was killed.", "description": "WOODBINE, Ga.
