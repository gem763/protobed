Understandably, the plan to assign a secret number to students that will affect their college admissions did not receive a warm welcome from the American public.\n\nHowever, the College Board still plans to create a new tool called \u201cLandscape\u201d which will serve much of the same purpose as the Adversity Score, without assigning students a specific number.\n\nCollege Board CEO David Coleman (also the architect of the Common Core Standards) stated, \u201cLandscape provides admissions officers more consistent background information so they can fairly consider every student, no matter where they live and learn.\u201d\n\nAdmissions offices already take a variety of factors into account when deciding whom to admit into their school. While Coleman claims that Landscape will simply provide context to a student\u2019s application, the implications of this new tool will be far more pervasive than that.\n\nOne of the greatest flaws in the College Board\u2019s Adversity Score was that it tied the fate of students to their ZIP code.\n\nLandscape will continue to rank a student\u2019s perceived difficulty based on the neighborhood that they live in for the purpose of providing greater advantage to those from particularly disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nThe hardships students might face in other neighborhoods\u2014be they difficult home environments or other obstacles faced during their K-12 years\u2014may not be captured through College Board data that relies on geography as a proxy for adversity.\n\nWhile the College Board is backtracking on its plans to assign students a specific score, the organization still plans to move the college admissions process away from one that rewards students based on academic performance.\n\nThe SAT is perhaps one of the few measures left in American education meant solely to test academic aptitude regardless of a student\u2019s background.\n\nIt is certainly true that our public school system has failed to prepare many students for the SAT, higher education, or even the workforce\u2014something that won\u2019t be remedied through Adversity Scores or related policies.\n\nTo fix this problem, policymakers should bolster state-based school choice options that would allow families to pick a school that is the right fit for their child, setting them up for long-term success.\n\nAssigning students to a school based on their parents\u2019 ZIP code reinforces a cycle of poverty that prevents too many students from achieving their full potential.\n\nFurthermore, Americans should be wary of a growing trend to make a college education about everything except education. This non-academic arms race has resulted in a proliferation of resort-style lazy rivers, professional grade athletic programs, and social justice protests dominating campus culture.\n\nThis trend is amplified by recent political pushes to make college tuition \u201cfree.\u201d Rhetoric that makes college a \u201cright\u201d for all students makes the false assumption that college is the \u201cright choice\u201d for all students.\n\nResearch suggests that over 40% of recent graduates are in jobs that do not require their degree. Those students may have been better served by pursuing a postsecondary route that did not wind through traditional universities, bringing with it the burden of considerable student loan debt.\n\nThe College Board\u2019s decision to remove the Adversity Score on the SAT yet continue to provide schools with personal information about students through Landscape will continue to give preference to students based on the College Board\u2019s idea of what should matter in college admissions.\n\nThe College Board should stick to its day job. Hardworking students deserve a fair shot at college, regardless of how they fare on the College Board\u2019s excel spreadsheet.", "description": "It appears that many Americans still believe that merit is the most important factor in determining who will get into our top colleges and universities.\n\nOn Tuesday, the College Board announced\u2014after receiving considerable criticism\u2014that it will no longer pursue adding an \u201cAdversity Score\u201d to the SAT.", "authors": ["Mary Clare Amselem", "Policy Analyst", "Mary Clare Is A Policy Analyst At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-492198113.jpg?itok=JDgsrZzk"}
