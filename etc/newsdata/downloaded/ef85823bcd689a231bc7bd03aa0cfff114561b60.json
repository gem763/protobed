He calls them a revelation\n\nThis month, he is starring in Skeletons In The Cupboard, a new Radio 4 drama series on Fridays at 11.30am. The first episode can be downloaded via BBC Sounds.\n\nWhat did your parents teach you about money?\n\nThat the priority was to keep it coming in. My father ran his own medical research business. He was self-employed and had lots of ups and downs. My mother was a speech therapist, but after she had me and my two brothers she gave up her career.\n\nBoth my parents lived through the Second World War and had a frugal 'make do and mend' attitude towards money.\n\nFor example, the idea of taking a taxi somewhere was shocking to them. But we lived in a big house and I didn't think we had any money problems.\n\nI later discovered my father had been anxious about his income. He papered over the cracks so his family would think everything was fine. I can be overly confident about money as a result but I have also inherited a feeling of anxiety about it.\n\nWhat was the first paid work you ever did?\n\nWorking as a gravedigger at a local cemetery for \u00a320 a week, aged 19. At the same time, I was doing unpaid acting jobs and trying to get work in the theatre. I was fully aware that being a gravedigger was a dead-end job.\n\nI had to have a strong stomach. If the measurements for the grave were slightly off, I would find myself cutting through skeleton and rotten wood.\n\nHave you ever struggled to make ends meet?\n\nYes. Being an actor is a volatile career. Even when you think you've made it, you can struggle.\n\nI spoke to a famous actor just the other week who said he hadn't had a job all year.\n\nThere are times when you really are tense. I remember getting a royalty cheque for \u00a32,000 out of the blue, more than 20 years ago. I nearly fainted with relief. You can be financially extended on credit cards and bank loans.\n\nOf course, my parents warned me that acting was an insecure profession, but at the time I didn't care. And then reality hits, especially when you've got kids and you're committed to a mortgage.\n\nTV gold: Nigel Planer got paid just a few hundred pounds for each episode of The Young Ones\n\nHave you ever been paid silly money?\n\nNo, I don't think I have. The Young Ones was a big hit, but we only made 12 episodes and of course that was our first foray into TV. I was only paid a few hundred pounds an episode \u2013 maybe \u00a3400.\n\nI do still receive royalties for the show, but that's worked out as a percentage of what I was originally paid. So it's only a little amount.\n\nWhat was the best year of your financial life?\n\nIt is a toss-up between 2004 and 2008. Each of those years, I starred in a big hit musical: Wicked and We Will Rock You. I earned a six-figure salary each year.\n\nThe downside was that I had to play the same part eight times a week. You cannot imagine how physically and mentally clobbering that is. It really is tough.\n\nWhat is the most expensive thing you bought for fun?\n\nAn artwork by English artist Gillian Ayres. It's a limited edition print which she hand-painted. It's probably worth \u00a32,000, abstract and colourful. It hangs in our dining room.\n\nWhat is your biggest money mistake?\n\nBuying an old property on Eel Pie Island, Twickenham, in South West London, for \u00a3300,000, 20 years ago.\n\nAfter we bought it, we realised the tide came in over the garden which would have been fine except that my wife and I had just had a baby.\n\nThe problems mounted \u2013 we couldn't get planning permission for an extension \u2013 and when we came to sell no one could get a mortgage because there had been terrible floods in York.\n\nAll the mortgage companies refused to lend because of the tidal garden. We ended up selling at a loss. I've blocked the amount we lost from my mind because it was so traumatic.\n\nDo you save into a pension?\n\nNo, but I used to when I was doing a lot of TV in the 1980s and earning good money. I'm so grateful I did that.\n\nIt takes the edge off now I'm 66 because the State pension is not enough to live on. My pension isn't huge but a lot of actors I know are still having to go out on tour at my age.\n\nPension goals: Nigel Planer used to save into a pension when he was doing a lot of TV work\n\nI have never invested in shares outside of my pension. I'm not a natural risk taker and even if I were, I would question what I could have taken a risk with. I am not sitting on a big pile of money. If I were, I might feel differently.\n\nDo you own any property?\n\nYes, I own a small studio flat in London. My wife and I got married six years ago and we live in her home which is a two-bedroom converted chapel in East London.\n\nIt was built in 1875 as part of a tin factory. It has bare brick walls and one fantastic room that's about 40ft long.\n\nWhat little luxury do you treat yourself to?\n\nExpensive socks. It seems ridiculous to pay between \u00a325 and \u00a330 for a pair of socks direct from Falke or via an exclusive gentleman's shop. But they are a revelation.\n\nWhen you buy cheap socks in packs of six, they bunch up your toes. After a couple of washes, they resemble shrivelled bags.\n\nWith expensive socks, you can stretch your toes. They don't make marks around your ankles and are designed to fit your heel properly.\n\nMy shoes slide on \u2013 and they look good. In just sheer pleasure alone, they pay back what they cost.\n\nIf you were Chancellor what would you do?\n\nI would give an income tax concession to black cab drivers in London.\n\nThey offer disabled facilities, but are often undercut by Uber and other minicab drivers which don't.\n\nIt's not fair because black cabs come with higher vehicle and licensing costs than other taxis. Plus black cabs are an iconic London image. I would hate to see them die out.\n\nWhat is your number one financial priority?\n\nTo have the freedom to make good artistic decisions. I want to have enough to live on so I can spend my time being creative and developing the projects I really care about.", "description": "Actor\u00a0Nigel Planer got paid just a few hundred pounds for each episode of The Young Ones - and has made more money starring in musicals over the years.", "authors": ["Donna Ferguson For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
