(Getty Images)\n\nLisfranc injuries are in the mid-foot, and stem from ligaments in the area rupturing, causing instability with the joints. Some Lisfranc injuries also involve trauma to the small bones of the foot, but as Person notes, the Panthers\u2019 initial wording on Newton\u2019s injury last month was that it was a mid-foot sprain, suggesting it\u2019s ligament-related (sprains are muscle/ligament tears of varying degrees).\n\nSome athletes do require season-ending surgery to repair Lisfranc damage, but Person reported that the current plan for Newton does not include surgery.\n\nA rest period of 4-to-8 weeks could be in order.\n\n\u2018What Cam needs is time\u2019\n\nIn announcing on Monday that Allen will start this week when the Panthers face the Houston Texans, Carolina coach Ron Rivera said, \u201cWhat Cam needs right now is time and rest for his foot. We want him at 100 percent when he\u2019s ready, so there\u2019s no exact timetable for his return. At this point, we\u2019re going to go forward with Kyle as our starter.\u201d\n\nNewton was injured last month during a preseason game against the New England Patriots. He played in the regular-season opener less than two weeks later but didn\u2019t look like himself in either of the two games he played before he was sidelined.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllen, a second-year quarterback who was undrafted last year, played well last Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, completing 19-of-26 passes for 261 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury in his left foot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ki2fERTJWbPtpnxokLptXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ur6isw7cZ5ZBZayjAWucRg--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/0e4ffd60-dede-11e9-b33f-74ffafed1325", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
