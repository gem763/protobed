When a black student asked Sanders how he should handle getting pulled over by a police officer, Sanders responded \"respect what they are doing so that you don't get shot in the back of the head.\"\n\nSanders made the statement during a question-and-answer session at the forum at Benedict College, a historically black college. The student asked Sanders, \"If I'm your son, what advice would you give me next time I'm pulled over by a police officer?\"\n\nSanders advised the student do his best to identify the police officer \"in a polite way.\"\n\n\"I would respect what they are doing so that you don't get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit,\" he said. \"I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with that police officer, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure if possible that police officer's camera is on what goes on.\"\n\n.@BernieSanders to black student on how to handle getting pulled over by the police: \u201cIdentify who the police officer is - respect what they are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.\u201d pic.twitter.com/MND84NELLL \u2014 chris evans (@notcapnamerica) October 26, 2019\n\nCBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reported that the question appeared to \"stump\" Sanders and the presidential candidate struggled to answer. Sanders did not get much applause or crowd approval, she said.\n\nThe question was later asked to former Vice President Joe Biden by a black female student.\n\n\"If you were my daughter, you'd be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn't be pulled over,\" Biden said. \"That's what's wrong.\"\n\nBiden tweeted out a clip of his answer. \"Institutional racism should no longer exist. As president, I'll put forward change to help put an end to it,\" he said in the clip.\n\nInstitutional racism should no longer exist.

But if you are poor, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, it's a different story,\" he said in the clip.\n\nIf you are wealthy and powerful, or maybe the president, you are above the law.
