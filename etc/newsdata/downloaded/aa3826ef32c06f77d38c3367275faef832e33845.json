But the fact that the wheels came off the hearing moments after it started reflected just how utterly painful Republicans want to make Democrats\u2019 newly minted impeachment inquiry.\n\nChairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) could not get through his questioning of Lewandowski\u2014President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and a key figure in Robert Mueller\u2019s report\u2014without the witness slow-walking by asking for a copy of the report itself and then asking for instructions on how to find specific passages.\n\nThen, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), the top Republican on the panel, forced two groan-inducing votes on parliamentary procedure, which devolved into gavel-banging and shouting from Democrats and Republicans over Lewandowski\u2019s clock-chewing tactics and Nadler\u2019s move to give himself more time for questioning, respectively.\n\nIt was a frustrating and foreboding start to an event that Judiciary Committee Democrats had billed as their first real impeachment hearing\u2014and their first real cross-examination of a close Trump associate.\n\nWhile no one expected genuine revelations from Lewandowski, who remains a vocal Trump supporter, Democrats did hope for a chance to amplify to the public a central instance of possible obstruction of justice outlined in Mueller\u2019s report. The special counsel found that Trump met with Lewandowski and asked him to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curb the Mueller probe.\n\nInstead, Democrats were largely left to read sections of the report aloud while Lewandowski responded by asking them to repeat their questions\u2014or by saying he couldn\u2019t answer them. He also went so far as to declare he could not answer questions that were simply in the report itself.\n\nLate on Monday night, the White House\u2019s legal team wrote to Nadler telling him that Lewandowski would be unable to answer any questions about conversations with the president.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s conduct so infuriated Democrats that several members called for him to be held in contempt of Congress for obstructing their investigation. Near the end of the hearing, Nagler dangled the punishment but ultimately suggested the committee had bigger fish to fry.\n\nSeveral of his exchanges with Democrats grew testy as the hearing unfolded. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) hammered Lewandowski, arguing that his stonewalling of questions blocked \u201cany reasonable inquiry\u201d into the truth.\n\n\u201cThis is a House judiciary, not a house party,\u201d the congresswoman quipped.\n\nLewandowski, in turn, asked her to repeat her questions, which he described as \u201cjust a rant.\u201d\n\nBut Lewandowski did reveal some nuggets of new information, if minor. Under questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA), Lewandowksi said that he was not reluctant to deliver Trump\u2019s message to Sessions and only did not do so because he went on vacation\u2014a remark that prompted laughs from the Democratic side of the dais.\n\nLewandowski has been expected to soon kick off a U.S. Senate bid in his home state of New Hampshire\u2014and was expected to use his high-profile appearance as a boost. Minutes before Lewandowski was scheduled to testify, a supporter of his nascent political efforts began laying the groundwork for what will undoubtedly be an expensive campaign.\n\nStand With Corey PAC filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission at 12:44 p.m., registered to a post office box in Manchester, New Hampshire, and bearing few fingerprints about the people or organization behind it. But just minutes after the ostensibly independent Stand With Corey political group was created, Lewandowski\u2019s communications adviser Emily Miller, who sat behind him at the hearing, urged supporters to chime in with the hashtag #StandWithCorey.\n\nEarlier in the day, accompanying website domains, including standwithcorey.com and istandwithcorey.com, were also registered. The person or organization behind them also took steps to conceal their identity, employing a service that hides website registration details.\n\nAnd during a brief recess in the hearing, Lewandowski\u2019s Twitter account posted a link to the Stand With Corey website, which \u201cjust launched to help a potential Senate run.\u201d\n\nAnd early on, Lewandowski did impress perhaps the only person he needed to: his old boss. After he wrapped his opening remarks, Trump tweeted his approval, saying he delivered a \u201cbeautiful\u201d opening statement.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Lachlan Markay.", "description": "The former Trump campaign chief and Republican lawmakers swiftly derailed the Democrats\u2019 newly minted impeachment hearings almost as soon as they started.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3018,w_5366,x_0,y_134/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568744253/RTX73D0C_e7orqj", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
