Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (D-Texas) presidential campaign said its chances to win the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 nomination hinges on top 5 finishes in the early caucus states of Iowa and Nevada.\n\nO\u2019Rourke and Campaign Manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said during a livestreamed meeting with staffers that the campaign\u2019s priority remains the first four nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, but that its path includes victories further down the road.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very focused on the early states. We\u2019re playing to win there,\u201d O'Malley Dillon said. \u201cWe feel so good about the work there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to just focus there, we\u2019re also going to focus on a national strategy that is going to play to our strengths on Super Tuesday,\u201d she added, referencing a day on which 17 states and territories, including O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home state of Texas, will hold their primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe campaign clarified in its \u201cpath to win\u201d published online that it believes it can place as low as fifth in the Iowa caucuses and third in the Nevada caucuses to \u201cstill be competitive.\u201d It did not note where it hopes to place in New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nThe campaign also said it was launching a program dubbed \u201cThe Slingshot\u201d to propel it moving forward, saying it hopes to attract $2 million in donations in the next six weeks to expand advertising and organizing programs. The campaign added it is not a \u201cstunt\u201d but that it \u201c[needs] it quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a path to the nomination and through that a path to the presidency,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, noting the campaign has more work to do to break out its message. \u201cThere is no later moment to do it, it must happen now if we\u2019re going to make the most of this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident in our ability to compel our fellow American to see in us a unique opportunity and chance for this country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe campaign, which has stagnated in both fundraising and polls compared to several of the 19 primary competitors, repeatedly expressed confidence in its message and pushed back against a narrative that the nominating race has morphed into a contest between a few top-tier candidates.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s our challenge: we are in an extraordinary field of candidate, really the best that has ever been assembled,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a livestreamed meeting with campaign staff. \u201cWe would not be in this if we did not feel that we have something different and better to offer this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pundits to some degree, the pollsters and folks in the media\u2026in too many instances have defined tis race as only between two people. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s convenient, in some cases, it\u2019s lazy. We\u2019re going to have to break through that,\u201d he added.\n\nO'Malley Dillon adopted a tougher tone, saying the narrative that the race has emerged as a contest between former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenDemocratic 2020 hopefuls tout LGBTQ plans at town hall Trump bashes Biden at Minnesota rally, asks 'Where's Hunter? 'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally MORE and Sens.

It\u2019s total bullshit.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear which two candidates to whom O\u2019Rourke and O'Malley Dillon were referring.\n\nThe unveiling of the campaign\u2019s path to victory comes after it announced it had raised $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2019. The figure was higher than the $3.6 million O\u2019Rourke raised in 2019\u2019s second quarter but well beneath the $9.4 million he hauled in during the year\u2019s first quarter.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s fundraising haul also trailed those of Biden, Warren and Sanders, as well as several middle-tier candidates such as Sens.
