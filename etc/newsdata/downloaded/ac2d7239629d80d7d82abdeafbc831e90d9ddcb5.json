(Oct. 29) AP, AP\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to President Donald Trump's comments about his top Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's testimony, writing on Twitter, \"Everybody has read your words on the call.\"\n\nPelosi notes that in the summary of the July 25 call released by the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asks for military aid to fight back against a Russian invasion, to which Trump replies \"I want you to do us a favor though\" and asks for investigations into his political opponents.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the president had tweeted criticism of Vindman.\n\n\"Was he on the same call that I was? Can't be possible!\" the president tweeted of Vindman's planned testimony, also calling him a \"Never Trumper.\"\n\nMore: Trump impeachment inquiry enters Week 6: National Security Council officials to be questioned on Ukraine aid\n\nSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nVindman plans to tell the House Oversight, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence Committees he was \"concerned\" by the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\" Vindman wrote. A copy of his planned testimony for Tuesday was obtained Monday evening by USA TODAY.\n\n\"I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\" Vindman wrote in his testimony. \"This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\"\n\nEverybody has read your words on the call. The Ukrainian President asks for military aid to fend off the Russian attack, you say \u201cI want you to do us a favor though,\u201d and then you spend the rest of the call asking for bogus investigations to smear your political opponents. https://t.co/vI2eD4T6vK \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 29, 2019\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Savannah Behrmann\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/nancy-pelosi-responds-trump-tweets-impeachment-inquiry-alexander-vindman/2495003001/", "description": "Nancy Pelosi responded to Trump's tweets about Alexander\u00a0Vindman's testimony, writing on Twitter, \"Everybody has read your words on the call.\"", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published A.M.
