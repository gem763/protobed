It\u2019s 2019 but feels like the 1950s. #feminist,\" she added.\n\nKATY PERRY SUED FOR $150G OVER OLD HALLOWEEN PIC IN HILLARY CLINTON COSTUME\n\nHours earlier, Upton said MLB umpires were right to rule that Nationals outfielder Trea Turner had interfered with Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel while running out his slow roller in the top of the seventh inning. Turner was initially called out on the play before the game was stopped for about 10 minutes while the umpires discussed the situation with MLB officials in New York.\n\nUpton, 27, tweeted a photo of the game, as well as voiced her frustration that the review of the call was taking so long.\n\nKATE UPTON SHARES RARE PHOTO OF DAUGHTER CHEERING ON DAD JUSTIN VERLANDER\n\n\"He [Turner] wasn\u2019t within the base path,\" Upton explained. \"Those who don\u2019t know the rule you HAVE to run inside the 2 lines. Not sure why the review is taking so long...\"\n\nMultiple Twitter users commented saying things like \"stick to modeling\" and \"stick to what you know.... modeling.\" Another person wrote: \".......nothing more than the losing pitchers [sic] wife. Shhhhhhhh.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other social media commenters agreed with Upton.\n\n\"Agreed,\" said one. \"Ump made the right call, he should be out.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnother read: \"MS Kate, you are absolutely correct.
