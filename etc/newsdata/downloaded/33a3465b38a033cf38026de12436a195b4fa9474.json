They thought they would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go \u2014 actually we have a better map than that which is going to be presented where we had many lines going directly, many models, each line being a model, going directly through.

When news outlets attempted to correct him, he referred to their reports as \u201cphoney\u201d.\n\nThe president then continued to assert he was right about Alabama being included in the forecast, saying later on Wednesday there are \u201cother, better maps\u201d that include the state in their forecasts. The weather service has disputed those claims.", "description": "Donald Trump presented an altered National Hurricane Centre map that expanded Hurricane Dorian\u2019s official forecast so it would include Alabama, a state he incorrectly and repeatedly said would be hit by the storm.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/18/trumpmap-sharpie.jpg"}
