He is a music mogul, entrepreneur and film producer. And now he\u2019s a restauranteur.\n\nWhen Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move asked Master P about the biggest purchase he\u2019s ever made for himself or his business, his answer was investing in the food business. The music mogul recently opened burger joint Big Poppa Burgers in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cFor my business right now, I'm really focused on the food business,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my grandfather made this recipe. So we built this restaurant in New Orleans... And we have the best burgers. I feel like we could be like a Wendy's, McDonald's, as far as chain-wise but not food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we have the best food. The kept secret is my grandfather recipe. But I looked at In-N-Out Burger, one of those places. I say, why we can't do that? So me being from New Orleans, me and my son got together, and we created this business,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I feel like building that into a franchise, it's important for the family to give other people work. It's not just for me.\u201d\n\nLOUISVILLE, KY - MAY 03: Master P performs at the Barnstable Brown Gala on May 3, 2019 in Louisville, Kentucky.

So I want to cross-promote everything that I have. And I feel like I could sell other product,\u201d he explained.\n\nSo, with all the craze over meatless, will Master P consider going along with that trend in his own business?\n\n\u201cI do both. So I have the plant, veggie burgers. And I also \u2014 you know, I have the real bee,\u201d Master P said. \u201cAnd then right now, the chicken is hot right now. And Popeyes is out of chicken. But Big Poppa's, we have a lot of chicken.\u201d\n\nRalston Ramsay is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nThis company lets you invest in fine art for as little as ... - Yahoo Finance\n\nNow men can customize suits by using an AI-powered \"Style Wall\"\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Music mogul & entrepreneur Master P joins Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move to discuss his new food venture, Big Poppa Burgers.", "authors": ["Ralston Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v6i3DL5qE1lYSo7FqmIn9A--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/88253a80-da54-11e9-9efd-9d9d5406aee5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
