I think it is a mistake. I think, as politicians and Conservatives, we should be looking to find the compromise and using persuasion and intelligence to try and find that compromise.\"\n\nMs Rudd told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: \"I am surprised, and I think it is a very un-Conservative thing to be doing. I have sat in three cabinets under three different prime ministers, and this level of confrontation with parliament I have never seen before.\"\n\nDominic Grieve, the former attorney general, also accused the government of \"trashing the constitution\" and said the Conservative Party was no longer a party he recognised.\n\nBut speaking on Thursday, the prime minister denied lying to Queen over his reasons for suspending parliament.\n\nAsked whether he had misled the monarch after the Court of Session in Edinburgh said advice given by ministers to the Queen which led to her rubber-stamping the five-week prorogation was unlawful, Mr Johnson replied: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The High Court in England plainly agrees with us but the Supreme Court will have to decide.\n\n\"We need a Queen's Speech, we need to get on and do all sorts of things at a national level. Parliament will have time both before and after that crucial [EU] summit on 17 October and 18 to talk about the Brexit deal.\"", "description": "Amber Rudd has revealed Theresa May considered suspending parliament, but ruled out the idea as the \"wrong approach\" and \"un-Conservative\".
