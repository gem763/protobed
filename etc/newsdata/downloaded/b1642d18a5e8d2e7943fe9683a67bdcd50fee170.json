We\u2019re not exposing any of our actual body parts\u2014we\u2019re not violating the rules\u2014but performers are being deleted en masse,\u201d Evans tells The Daily Beast. \u201cWe\u2019d been sending [Instagram] naked pictures of Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian that still sit on Instagram. These are celebrities that are a part of the elite. They have pictures of themselves fully exposing their breasts, you report the image, and you\u2019re told it\u2019s not a violation.\u201d\n\nSo, Evans tweeted at Heard asking her to support the \u201cthousands of sex workers\u201d like herself who\u2019ve been on the frontlines of the fight against Instagram\u2019s censorship practices\u2014and, much to Evans\u2019 surprise, the actress replied in kind.\n\n\u201cYou have my support! Sex workers rights are human rights. The fact this is even a topic of debate should take the breath out of any feminist, or humanist for that matter,\u201d Heard tweeted, later adding, \u201cI always have publicly supported sex worker rights but of course I would love 2 hear more about how I can help what you\u2019re speaking 2. Thank u 4 not assuming, tho i havent been involved n ur particular fight, that it means I haven't been aware of sex worker issues at all.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Evans had tweeted at everyone from Kim Kardashian to Miley Cyrus to Sharon Stone asking them to \u201camplify the message\u201d concerning Instagram\u2019s treatment of sex workers, but her pleas had fallen on deaf ears. \u201cEvery other time before now they\u2019ve ignored it. They have no problem hashtagging #FreeTheNipple but they don\u2019t understand that this is beyond your nipple. You\u2019re fighting to be able to expose yourself, we\u2019re fighting to be able to exist,\u201d says Evans.\n\n\u201cAmber replies, and is completely kind. When she did, it was amazing. It was a moment of, thank you for hearing us,\u201d Evans continues. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, oh my lord, it started.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Johnny Depp truther accounts began targeting Evans for the crime of being acknowledged by Heard\u2014the Pirates of the Caribbean actor\u2019s former spouse, who received a $7 million settlement from Depp after accusing him of domestic abuse (Depp has contested the claims).\n\n\u201c I started to realize that all of these people have Johnny Depp as their photo on their profiles, and then I realized what was happening. In a matter of 24 hours, it started from a trickle to a full-blown harassment campaign. \u201d\n\n\u201cIt started with people coming at me, accusing me of getting involved with someone who was an \u2018abuser.\u2019 I was completely confused. I didn\u2019t understand what it was that they were talking about,\u201d recalls Evans. \u201cAnd then I started to realize that all of these people have Johnny Depp as their photo on their profiles, and then I realized what was happening. In a matter of 24 hours, it started from a trickle to a full-blown harassment campaign.\u201d\n\nEvans received a barrage of messages from Depp superfans disputing the abuse allegations against their hero that \u201call look like bot accounts, follow the same number of people that follow them, and use these chocolate-donut emojis to show their solidarity.\u201d Then the tweets got personal, calling Evans a variety of awful names\u2014\u201cbitch,\u201d \u201ccunt,\u201d you name it\u2014and threatening her for so much as associating with Heard.\n\n\u201cI thought, wait a minute, Amber is being attacked just for existing, and I\u2019m being attacked just for talking to her!\u201d exclaims Evans. \u201cSo, I posted a message of support for her because, at that moment, I could see all the crap that she was dealing with\u2014all of these crazy, obsessed fans of Johnny Depp\u2019s that are coming for her.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the message of support, Evans posted the infamous TMZ video from 2016 that shows a clearly-inebriated Depp furiously shouting at Heard in an aggressive manner while rearranging their kitchen with his fists.\n\n\u201cI grew up with 21 Jump Street and have probably watched every single movie he\u2019s made,\u201d Evans says of Depp. \u201cHowever, after seeing the TMZ video back in 2016, I wasn\u2019t interested in watching his movies anymore or supporting anything he\u2019s done. And that was my choice.\u201d\n\nEvans is no stranger to online harassment. In addition to her position as an outspoken adult actress, she became embroiled in the Donald Trump-Stormy Daniels affair saga when she revealed to The Daily Beast that Trump had invited her into a threesome with himself and Daniels, and that Daniels had confided in her that Trump chased her around his hotel room \u201cin his tighty-whities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we know, I have my history with Trump. I\u2019ve been through Trump harassment. This was worse. This brought more fear about my personal safety than my Donald Trump situation, simply because of the level of crazy, the obsession,\u201d says Evans. \u201cPolitics are one thing, but when you are an obsessed fan and worship someone, it\u2019s a different level of obsession. These are the types of people that show up outside your house.\u201d\n\nShe pauses. \u201cIt made me appreciate and respect the fact that Amber took the time to post that message of solidarity, because I understood how much hate mail she gets on a daily basis. She puts herself through so much just to hear our cries, and show us support.\u201d", "description": "The adult actress and industry advocate opens up about the harassment she received from Johnny Depp\u2019s army of Twitter truthers after she was shouted-out by Amber Heard.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572084712/191024-Stern-depp-pornstar-twitter_2_aho7kq", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
