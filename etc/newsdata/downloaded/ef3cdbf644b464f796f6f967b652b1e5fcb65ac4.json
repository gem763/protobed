REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\n\u201cThis government absolutely believes in the City,\u201d Glen told a conference in London, adding that revenues from finance were key to Britain\u2019s ability to fund healthcare, police and regional development. \u201cWe will strain every sinew to help you flourish.\u201d\n\nFinancial firms in Britain lose unfettered direct access to investors in the bloc after Brexit and will instead have to rely on the EU\u2019s system of equivalence.\n\nUnder this system, Brussels grants market access if it deems that a foreign financial firm\u2019s home rules are strict enough to ensure that EU customers are well protected.\n\nGlen said that Britain stood ready to start negotiating equivalence in key areas with the EU as soon as Brexit has happened - although when that will be remains unknown.\n\nThe EU on Monday agreed a 3-month flexible delay to Britain\u2019s departure, until Jan. 31, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was driven to request a postponement due to lawmakers rejecting the sequence of the ratification of the divorce deal agreed with Brussels.\n\nIf Britain leaves the bloc with a deal, it would have a transition period until the end of 2020, meaning business as usual for the banks.\n\nBritain has said it does not want to be a permanent \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules to maintain EU financial market access and Glen said the issue was how to find a more \u201cenduring mechanism\u201d that recognizes that changes in rules can occur on both sides.\n\n\u201cWe have got to weigh the issue up very carefully,\u201d Glen said, adding it was difficult to know \u201cwhere it would land\u201d until equivalence negotiations with Brussels started.\n\n\u201cIt will be a carefully designed position that we adopt,\u201d Glen added.\n\nBritain needs to be able to set its own rules and Glen hinted that some of the EU\u2019s capital rules for insurers could be amended, given what he called \u201cpressure\u201d in Britain for changes.\n\n\u201cWe need an agile and responsive regulatory approach,\u201d Glen said.\n\nBritain sees Brexit as making it possible to negotiating its own trade deals with other countries, and China\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, told the conference that Britain and China were already building foundations for strong future cooperation in financial services.\n\n\u201cBritain is at a crucial stage of Brexit, but I am confident the UK will not lose its strength in financial services easily and London will retain its status as an international financial center,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nFintech could be a key bridge to deeper China-UK cooperation in financial services, he said.\n\nFinancial services are more dependent than any other economic sector on being able to hire highly-skilled staff from across the world and Britain would introduce a post-Brexit immigration system that supported competitiveness, Glen said.\n\nBanks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have opened over 300 hubs in the EU to deal with whatever form Brexit takes.", "description": "Britain will do whatever it can to ensure that its financial sector remains a major global player after Brexit, financial services minister John Glen said on Monday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445833785&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0V7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
