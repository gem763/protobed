Some businesses in the border towns, which initially prospered, are now struggling.\n\nFlights between the two capital cities, Addis Ababa and Asmara, have resumed.\n\nSome Tigrayans, the ethnic group in the north-east region that borders Eritrea, had protested at the opening of the border posts.\n\nThe dominant political group in the north-east region, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), was against the process and has terse relations with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.\n\nWhen the peace deal was signed, Mr Isaias was highly critical of the TPLF - his nemesis when the countries were officially at war.\n\nWhen the Ethiopian government attempted to remove military equipment from the border, it was blocked by residents of Tigray who feared future conflict with their neighbour.\n\nSome analysts also blame the slow progress towards peace on Eritrea's President Isaias.\n\nHe has resisted opening up his country, considered to be one of the most oppressive on the continent, so he is not pushed into making reforms at home, his critics say.\n\nHave there been democratic improvements?\n\nWhen Mr Abiy came to power, he freed thousands of political prisoners, ended a state of emergency and unbanned numerous political parties.\n\nHe appointed the country's first female president, gave half the seats in his cabinet to women, and committed the country to full multi-party elections in 2020.\n\nThese are all measurable democratic gains, but his critics say his leadership style has relied on a cult of personality, while he has sidelined important government ministries from the decision-making process.\n\nHave Ethiopia's internal ethnic tensions got worse?\n\nTensions between Ethiopia's numerous ethnic communities have always been a matter of serious contention but the authoritarian state had kept a lid on the issue.\n\nWhen Mr Abiy came to power in April 2018, he introduced wider political freedoms.\n\nIn some areas, this has led to open conflict and led some 2.5 millions people to flee their homes in these unstable regions.\n\nA report by Refugees International in November last year criticised the government for encouraging premature returns to regions not yet safe and for not doing enough to protect civilians.\n\nWhat is Abiy's role as a regional peace mediator?\n\nIn his short time in office, Mr Abiy has also played a significant mediation role in other regional hot spots.\n\nHe was instrumental in bringing the military regime in Sudan to the negotiating table with the opposition following widespread protests in Khartoum and elsewhere.\n\nThe talk led to the formation of a transitional power-sharing government.\n\nIn addition, he has tried to help normalise diplomatic relations between Eritrea and Djibouti after years of political hostility.\n\nMr Abiy has also sought to mediate between Kenya and Somalia in a protracted conflict over the maritime border between the two countries.\n\nAnd he has been actively involved in peace talks between South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Riek Machar.\n\nHe facilitated a meeting between the two leaders in June last year in Addis Ababa although a peace deal signed last August has yet to be fully implemented.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The Ethiopian prime minister has won the Nobel Peace Prize, but how successful has he been?", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17D71/production/_109194679_gettyimages-1083976916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
