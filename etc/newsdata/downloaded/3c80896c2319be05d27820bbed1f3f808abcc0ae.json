He intended to achieve that intent by pushing Mr Jayasekera on to the tracks of a busy underground station.\n\nTwo dead after huge fire rips through working men's club\n\n\u2018As the judge noted, there was an obvious and high risk that Mr Jayasekera would come into contact with the live track or be struck by a train.\n\n\u2018In either of those circumstances, there was a very high risk that he would be seriously injured or killed.\u2019\n\nMuthuraja\u2019s sentence was referred to the Court of Appeal by Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Ellis said: \u2018The aggressive and deliberate actions of the offender caused the victim pain and could have ended his life.\n\n\u2018With this in mind, it is right that the Court of Appeal lengthened the offender\u2019s sentence.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
