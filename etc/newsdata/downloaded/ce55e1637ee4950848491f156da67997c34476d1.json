(Papi Morake)\n\nTharina Human and Laetitia Nel, who are accused of kidnapping 6-year-old Amy'Leigh de Jager, have asked the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court to allow them to be moved from \"Sun City\" female prison after their lives were allegedly threatened.\n\nHuman, Nel and Pieter van Zyl appeared in court for the continuation of their bail application which started on Thursday.\n\nAfter the State closed its case, the legal representatives for Human and Nel approached the court with an application to have them moved from Johannesburg prison, also known as \"Sun City\", to a holding cell in a police station until the outcome of the bail application.\n\nHuman's attorney, David Mey, told the court that Human was kept in a cell with 70 other detainees, who had access to the live stream of Wednesday's bail application.\n\nWhen Human returned to the prison, other detainees started intimidating her and threatened to kill her, based on what they saw, or heard.\n\nWATCH | 'I stand by her' - father of Amy'Leigh kidnapping accused\n\nIn the application, the court heard that Human was kept awake the entire night.\n\n\"I don't feel safe there,\" Human told the court in an affidavit Mey read out.\n\nNel's attorney, Stoffel Venter handed up an affidavit from Nel.\n\n\"[It's] clear other inmates had access to the media, they threatened to kill us.
