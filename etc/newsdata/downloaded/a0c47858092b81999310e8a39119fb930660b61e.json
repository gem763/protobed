The United States and its followers should bear in mind that if they raise the issue of our self-defensive measures at the U.N. Security Council, it will further urge our desire to defend our sovereignty. So we will sharply watch every move of the United States and U.N. Security Council. I thank you for your attention.\"Asked how the North plans to defend itself, Kim said to \"carefully watch\" what the regime will do in the future, but stressed that it does not mean the launch of another missile.The remarks came a day before the UN Security Council is slated to hold a closed-door meeting to discuss the North's test last week of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, as requested by Britain, France and Germany.The three countries cited North Korea's violation of UN Security Council resolutions that ban the regime from using ballistic missile technology.Despite the North's protest, the 15-member council is due to meet behind closed doors on Tuesday, local time.Lee Seung-jae, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
