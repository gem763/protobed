USA TODAY\n\nAs members of the baby boom generation age into retirement, more and more are relying on pension benefits for their main source of income.\n\nMillions of aging teachers, firefighters, sanitation workers, and other state and local government employees depend on the income owed to them through defined benefit pension plans. Such plans require employees to contribute a portion of their salaries to a pool of funds that is invested on their behalf and is paid out to them in retirement.\n\nPoor management of the pension funds at the state and local levels, however, has put those benefits at risk for many future retirees. According to nongovernmental organization The Pew Charitable Trusts, state pension systems currently have, on average, less than 70% of the assets they need to be able to pay out benefits owed to current or retired public employees. In some states, the gap is significantly smaller, while in others the pension funding gap is far worse.\n\nTo rank the severity of each state\u2019s pension crisis, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the average pension funding ratio \u2013 the market value of a pension fund as a percentage of the total benefits owed to current or retired public employees \u2013 for all 50 states as of 2017 with data from The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nParenting finances: These 2 child-related expenses have risen the most since 1960\n\nHow often should you check your credit reports?

States have varying contribution policies that affect how much regional public employers are required to contribute to pension funds, but in hard economic times, states use the funds meant for pension contributions in hopes they could make up the difference in times of economic growth. States with responsible contribution policies tend to meet their contribution benchmarks, while states with worse policies often fail to meet them. In 2017, a year with strong economic growth, only 17 states met their employer contribution benchmarks.\n\nOvergenerous benefits can also contribute to underfunded pensions. With greater benefits promised, pension obligations rise, leading states to either raise taxes or reduce services to meet them. In nine of the 10 states with the largest pension funding gaps, the average annual retirement benefits are greater than the $21,804 national average.\n\nHistorically, one of the largest drivers of pension funding shortfall has been poor market performance. While in 2017 the typical state pension plan had a 13.0% return on investment \u2013 greater than the median assumed return of 7.2% \u2013 in other years returns have fallen far below actuarial forecasts. In 2016, for example, the median rate of return on public pension plan funds was just 1.0%, far below the assumed rate of 7.5%.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo rank the severity of each state\u2019s pension crisis, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the average pension funding ratio \u2013 the market value of a pension fund as a share of the total benefits owed to current or retired public employees \u2013 for all 50 states as of 2017 with data from nongovernmental organization The Pew Charitable Trusts. Data on the total pension shortfall also came from Pew and is for 2017. Data on the average annual benefits payout per public retiree came from the research nonprofit National Institute on Retirement Security and figures are for 2016. Data on the share of the workforce employed in state and local government is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2018.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
