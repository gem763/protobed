But what are we doing about it?\n\nJust scrolling through social media and sharing a few posts? This YouTuber however, has done a lot more than just that.\n\nYoutube/Mr Beast\n\nA group of YouTubers created a campaign to raise $2 million dollars (approximately Rs 14,16,62,000) to plant over 20 million trees across the globe.\n\nThe campaign is being led by Jimmy Donaldson, who is known on YouTube as Mr Beast. He was asked (or as he says, spammed) by his followers to plant 20 million trees to celebrate his channel reaching 20 million subscribers in May.\n\nDon't Miss 21.5 K SHARES 2.1 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 325 SHARES 667 SHARES\n\nHe has collaborated with content creators like Mark Rober, Rhett & Link, EDM artist Marshmello, Jeffree Star, Simone Giertz, The Try Guys and Asap Science to help with the cause.\n\nWhile they tried their best, on their own they could only manage to plant 1700 trees which is still a great feat, but far from that their target was. However, Mr Beast didn't consider this as the end. He called on his viewers to donate a dollar to the Arbour Day Foundation which is the largest non-profit tree-planting organisation in the world. This foundation will plant one tree for every dollar that is donated.\n\nYoutube/Mr Beast\n\nIn this video, he says, \"Honestly I've done everything I can: I've got a bunch of fans together and we've planted thousands of trees. Me and Mark [Rober] have invested months of time behind the scenes getting this together and I'm personally planting 100,000 trees - aka a $100,000 donation. I've literally tried my best to do everything I can and now it's your turn.\"\n\nHe further added, \"We only have one Earth and it's important we take care of it. Recently lots of not so great things have been happening to forests and people just keep making fun of our generation for retweet activism and not actually doing something, which is why we created TeamTrees.org with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation.\"\n\nThe foundation has raised $906,000 (which is approximately Rs 6,41,72,886) If you wish to make your contribution, you can do it by donating here.", "description": "We know that global warming will end this planet and to combat this we need to plant trees.
