Under the law, foreigners are not taxed on foreign capital gains. But the Tax Office says trust capital gains rules mean this exemption does not apply.\n\nIn submissions to the Federal Court, the Greensill trust argued that interpretation of the law \"is plainly wrong\", adding that it goes against the purpose of the foreign resident exemption.\n\n\"If Parliament were asked to set out clearer words to disregard Mr Greensill's capital gains ... what would they be?\"\n\nBut the Tax Office claims that a condition of the foreign resident exclusions was not satisfied \"because the capital gains that [Mr Greensill] made were because of [the trust capital gains rules] and not from a CGT event.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Greensill family said that the $25 million in shares transferred were intended for employees of the company.\n\n\"The majority of the matter relates to a substantial gift of Greensill shares to employees, for which neither Lex Greensill nor the Peter Greensill Family Trust received any consideration.\n\n\"The company took extensive advice at the time and informed the ATO. It\u2019s disappointing that the ATO is taking action against business owners who have sought to share the success of their business with employees.\n\n\"We will vigorously defend this matter.\"\n\nThe significant gains arose due to the success of Mr Greensill's company. Founded in 2011, this year the business expects to book revenue of $600 million and, based on a capital raising in May, is worth about $5 billion.\n\nBut the company's growth has not occurred without some controversy. A flagship fund for which it originated assets lost nearly all of its investors. It's practice, referred to as reverse factoring, has attracted some criticisms recently. Mr Greensill argues that it democratises capital and is not \"evil\".", "description": "The Rich Lister is relying on the fact he lives in London in his fight to avoid paying tax on $60 million in capital gains from the sale of shares in the company he founded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_419/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b708f8e81c93bf293727cc6045eae002539d1c4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
