We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.\n\n\u201cAnd by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he confirmed he would insist on Northern Ireland leaving the customs union immediately, along with the rest of the UK \u2013 necessitating some customs checks, though he insisted these would not be at the border.\n\nHe suggested the proposal represented a compromise from the government \u2013 and urged the EU27 to respond in kind.\n\n\u201cI hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn. Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson made the Brexit offer the centrepiece of his speech \u2013 but he also laid the groundwork for a \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d general election, blaming MPs for trying to stop Brexit.\n\nJohnson launched a series of attacks on parliament, saying, it \u201crefuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom. If parliament were a school, Ofsted would be shutting it down. If parliament were a reality TV show, the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now.\u201d\n\nBrexit tactics: what is the strategy behind Boris Johnson's plan? Read more\n\nAnd he listed the domestic policies on which the Conservatives would fight the forthcoming general election, including investment in hospitals and schools, a crackdown on crime and an increase in the national living wage.\n\n\u201cI have seen so many things that give cause for hope. Hospitals that are finally getting the investment to match the devotion of the staff. Schools where standards of reading are rising through the use of synthetic phonics. Police colleges where idealistic young men and women are enrolling in large numbers to fight crime across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Johnson lashed out at Labour, calling it a party of \u201cfratricidal antisemitic Marxists\u201d, and highlighting radical policies including the four-day week and the abolition of private schools.\n\nDespite having won the leadership with the help of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG), Johnson insisted the Conservatives were not an anti-European party and the UK was not an anti-European country.\n\n\u201cWe love Europe. We are European,\u201d he said.", "description": "Prime minister outlines final offer to EU and attacks \u2018wheel of doom\u2019 parliament", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea705fb653b0406909c2f86bb0c832281fab5e04/0_142_6587_3952/master/6587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c3f90da0bd7b6ad2ac0ddb92c59ac14"}
