Okta, which manages identity and access, will integrate into Atlassian's cloud products, meaning that Atlassian customers can securely sign into popular products like Jira and Confluence.\n\n\"We're seeing this massive movement from on-premise based products into the cloud,\" Atlassian's vice president of product Joff Redfern told Business Insider. \"When they choose Okta, what's unique about it, if you're currently an Atlassian customer and you don't have an identify product, we're going to give you Okta for free, forever.\"\n\nFor Okta, COO and co-founder Frederic Kerrest says, it's an opportunity to gain new customers from Atlassian's wide reach. Right now, Okta has over 7,000 customers, while Atlassian has 152,000 customers. While Okta's identity management product will be free for Atlassian customers, if they want more advanced security products or use Okta with other applications, then they can purchase them.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for us to expand our partnership with Atlassian and find net new opportunities ourselves,\" Kerrest told Business Insider. \"That's an opportunity for us to have it flip from a free customer to a paying customer.\"\n\nAtlassian originally launched with software that runs on-premises, but now most of its customers are moving to the cloud \u2013 now, more than 90% of Atlassian's new customers choose a cloud product. And in September, Atlassian announced new updates and packaging plans for its cloud products.\n\nRead more: $32 billion Atlassian just made sweeping updates to its cloud products, as it changes with the times: 'We strongly believe cloud is our future'\n\nAs its cloud products became more popular, Atlassian customers started asking for this feature to use with those products, Redfern says. Atlassian decided it could either build its own identity and access management, or it could partner with another company.\n\nRedfern says many of Atlassian's customers were already using identity management providers, but Okta was one of the most popular ones, so Atlassian reached out.\n\n\"We've made that drop dead simple with this relationship with Okta,\" Redfern said. \"More and more companies are realizing, as they come into the cloud, one of the first things they tend to do is [say] 'Hey I can get a lot of benefits from having an identity provider.'\"", "description": "Atlassian Cloud customers can now use Okta to sign onto popular products like Jira and Confluence.
