Janie Barrett\n\nA team of scientists at Google's quantum computer laboratories in Santa Barbara, California, claimed in the science journal Nature that they had pulled off an elusive \"Quantum Supremacy\" experiment, showing that their \"Sycamore\" quantum computer was able to do a maths problem that was all-but impossible for a classical computer to do.\n\nQuantum computers harness the strange physical laws that govern the universe at the atomic scale, such as the fact that a photon of light can act as if it's in two places at the same time, and the fact that atomic particles can become \"entangled\" with each other so that the state of one particle affects the state of another particle, to make calculations that are practically impossible on computers that harness the classical laws of physics that control the universe at everything but the most minute scales.\n\nWhere the basic building block of a classical computer, the \"binary digit\", or \"bit\", can either represent a \"1\" or a \"0\", a \"quantum bit\" or \"qubit\", can be act as if it's some combination of 1 and 0, allowing the quantum computer to perform multiple calculations simultaneously.\n\nGoogle says its 54-qubit Sycamore chip finished in 200 seconds a random number calculation which the world's fastest supercomputer would take 10,000 years to do.", "description": "Google is standing by its claim that it had achieved one of the Holy Grails of\u00a0 quantum computing, building a quantum computer that could perform in minutes a calculation which would take a supercomputer 10,000 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2381%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_180%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a2a3d84ca93f6456739ec0629d1df15e11032352", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
