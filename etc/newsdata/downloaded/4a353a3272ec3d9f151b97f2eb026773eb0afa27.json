I am really pleased with the goal and overall really pleased with his performance.\n\n\u201cI thought he did really well against Belarus (in a friendly last month), he occupies the two centre-halves and he gives us a different option.\n\n\u201cHe took a few knocks, but it was a real competitive game without being too dirty.\u201d\n\nThe draw leaves the race for qualification in Group E delicately balanced with Wales trailing second-placed Slovakia by three points and Hungary by two, but having a game in hand on both.\n\nWales, who beat Slovakia 1-0 at home in March, will finish above them on their head to head record if they end on the same number of points.\n\nCroatia are three points clear of Slovakia and favourites to take the first of the two qualifying places after beating Hungary 3-0 in Split on Thursday.\n\n\u201cObviously now we have a better head to head than Slovakia but you still have to capitalise on that,\u201d Giggs said.\n\nWales\u00b4s Aaron Ramsey (Tim Goode/PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy away from home and it\u2019s always fine margins.\n\n\u201cIt could have gone either way and it was end to end, a good game for the neutral. Overall I\u2019m happy to get the draw because we were under pressure at times.\n\n\u201cBut we probably created the better chances. We could have won it, we could have lost it.\u201d\n\nWales have little time to recover from a pulsating encounter before playing Croatia in Cardiff on Sunday.\n\nGiggs hopes to have Aaron Ramsey available after the Juventus midfielder missed the Slovakia draw with a groin problem.\n\nWales\u00b4s Gareth Bale gestures to the fans (Tim Goode/PA)\n\nGareth Bale is expected to play after needing lengthy treatment in the final minute in Trnava, but Ethan Ampadu is doubtful after being substituted near the hour-mark.\n\nOn Bale, Giggs said: \u201cIt was on the far side so I didn\u2019t really see what happened, but I was a little bit worried when the referee called for a stretcher.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He took a knock but he should be OK.\n\n\u201cEthan was feeling a bit tired and a bit leggy with his lack of game-time (at RB Leipzig).\n\n\u201cWe just have to assess him because he\u2019s not playing games at the moment. We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but it might be too quick a turnaround for Ethan.\u201d", "description": "The 27-year-old has journeyed through non-league football and had a spell in Norway before making it to the international stage.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/04/wire-19570002-1570764838-416_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
