Dyson said \"as many of the team as possible\" would be reassigned to other roles in the company.\n\nSingapore government agency the Economic Development Board predicted the decision to ditch the project would have a minimal disruption on Dyson's operations in the Asian trading hub, as it was at an early stage.\n\n- Tough project -\n\nIn May, Dyson unveiled brief details of patents filed for the electric car and said it would be more energy-efficient than rivals -- and with \"very large wheels\" for city and rough-terrain driving.\n\nBut analysts were sceptical about the plan and not surprised about the change of heart.\n\n\"From the first instance it was always difficult to understand why Dyson thought that it would have any sort of competitive advantage in actually embarking on this project,\" Walter Theseira, a transport economist at Singapore University of Social Sciences, told AFP.\n\n\"Selling a successful electric car is really a very high-capital enterprise, it's a very ambitious project.\n\n\"Given the global competitive landscape, you're adding a new manufacturer which is untested in the car industry and which does not appear to have the same kind of deep pockets as existing local car manufacturers.\"\n\nElectric vehicles are increasing in popularity as governments worldwide seek to phase out polluting petrol and diesel cars, but producing them profitably is a challenge for even leading manufacturers.\n\nWhile Tesla has strong consumer appeal, investors have been frustrated by the pace of production and the company's ability to hit its financial targets.\n\nDespite dumping the project, Dyson insisted the company would continue a $3.1 billion investment programme in new technology, including the manufacture of batteries, robotics, machine learning and AI.\n\nThe company in May completed the move of its headquarters to Singapore, where many international firms have their Asian bases, and Dyson has since made headlines by going on a property-buying spree.\n\nHe reportedly paid Sg$74 million ($54 million) for Singapore's biggest, most expensive penthouse -- a three-floor residence with a rooftop terrace and jacuzzi.\n\nAnd the tycoon also bought a luxury house complete with an indoor waterfall, spiral staircase, landscaped garden and infinity pool, according to local media.\n\nburs-sr/kaf", "description": "British inventor James Dyson has dropped out of the race to produce electric cars in the face of stiff competition and after criticism of the Brexit-backing...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/07/wire-19575222-1570776764-939_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
