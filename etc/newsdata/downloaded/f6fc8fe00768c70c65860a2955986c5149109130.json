It is due to wake up soon and begin testing the mystery material.", "description": "Jade Rabbit rover snapped pictures of strange and mysterious material discovered within an impact crater.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_86528146_1571831471.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
