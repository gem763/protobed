In the 16th minute, Ashley Westwood\u2019s shot from the edge of the penalty area deflected off both of them, with Wood just unable to make solid contact to divert the ball past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nJamie Vardy equalised for Leicester just before half time with a bullet header beyond Tom Pope\n\nVardy leaps in jubilation after bringing his side back into the contest at the King Power stadium\n\nThe Leicester striker dedicates his goal to the club's late chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\n\nTwo minutes later, Soyuncu escaped his markers but headed James Maddison\u2019s corner just wide. This was Maddison\u2019s first appearance since he was pictured in a casino during England\u2019s defeat by Czech Republic, after illness had forced him out of the squad.\n\nLeicester came close again soon afterwards when the impressive Tielemans sent Pereira clear down the right. Harvey Barnes was first to the cross only for Matt Lowton to block it, and Ben Mee hooked the follow-up from Maddison off the line.\n\nLowton\u2019s intervention proved crucial as Burnley swiftly took the lead, once more exposing Leicester\u2019s fragility in defence. Dwight McNeil sent over an insidious cross from the right and Wood leapt above both Soyuncu and Jonny Evans to power the ball past Schmeichel.\n\nChris Wood gave the visitors the opener after guiding home a Dwight McNeil delivery\n\nThe New Zealander wheels away in delight after giving Burnley a surprise lead on Saturday\n\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez makes his way into the Leicester box as he is tracked by Jonny Evans\n\nAt this stage, Burnley\u2019s plan was working perfectly. They defended deep to deny Vardy space, and also doubled up in wide areas to subdue Leicester\u2019s attacking full-backs, Pereira and Ben Chilwell.\n\nWestwood was busy and clever in central midfield, while Wood and Jay Rodriguez kept the Foxes defence honest with their physical strength and unselfish running.\n\nYet no team can relax when facing one of the Premier League\u2019s most efficient goalscorers. Vardy had barely been in the game, but he showed how dangerous he can be when he raced on to Maddison\u2019s lofted pass but fired into the side netting.\n\nThe next time a chance came, Vardy showed no mercy as outjumped Mee to head Barnes\u2019 superb left-wing cross beyond Nick Pope. After being taunted by the visiting fans, Vardy celebrated with typical swagger by running towards them and lifting his hands to his ears. Wisely, he stopped his charge at the halfway line \u2013 but the forward had made his point.\n\nWood almost got his second of the game but failed to put the ball past Kasper Schmeichel\n\nKhun Vichai died last year in a tragic helicopter accident outside the King Power stadium\n\nIt was one of the few times Leicester had reached the byline in the first half but they came out for the second half with greater purpose and created far more problems for Sean Dyche\u2019s men.\n\nPereira had regained his rhythm and nearly set up Vardy for a second after Barnes had dummied a low cross, though Lowton read the danger and poked clear. Maddison swapped passes with Tielemans before blasting over from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nThen, Ayoze Perez \u2013 who had a poor afternoon \u2013 squandered a glorious chance to give Leicester the lead. Vardy robbed Jeff Hendrick in midfield and fed the Spaniard, who released Pereira but skied the return pass. It was no surprised to see him replaced by Demarai Gray soon afterwards.\n\nLeicester players wore warm up tops with their former owner's initials before kick off\n\nFans rose to their feet on the 60th minute to pay tribute to Khun Vichai on an emotional day\n\nWhat a good substitution it proved, as Gray started to combine effectively with Pereira on the right, and their interplay led to the second goal.\n\nA one-two gave Gray the space to cross, Barnes again sold the dummy to allow Tielemans, free inside the box, the time he needed to control the ball and smash it in off the crossbar. In the directors\u2019 box, Aiyawatt, known as Khun Top, clenched his fist in celebration.\n\nLeicester were dominant, so why did they switch off? Burnley grew in confidence and thought they had an equaliser when Lowton robbed Tielemans and crossed for Wood. Schmeichel saved the original effort, only for the ball to rebound off Evans and into the net.\n\nEvans protested immediately, and his complaint was upheld by VAR, which ruled that Wood had tripped the Leicester defender as he tried to clear. Burnley were furious, and Lowton and Westwood continued the protests to the officials long after the whistle had blown.", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT THE KING POWER: Youri Tielemans latched onto a Demarai Gray cross to score the decisive goal to give Leicester all three points in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929454-0-image-a-87_1571499901708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
