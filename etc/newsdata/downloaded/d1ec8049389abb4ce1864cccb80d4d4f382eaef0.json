Did we not learn anything from 2016 that polls are sh*t?\u201d", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who has taken as sustained and vitriolic a negative pounding as Biden and who has come through it with the strength he has,\u201d said a top Biden adviser. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t the argument not that he\u2019s a \u2018fragile front runner,\u2019 but instead why is this guy so strong? How is he able to withstand this? Because it is unrelenting. Every story that has been written about Biden for a month has been negative! I would ask Warren and Sanders and these folks: He\u2019s been pummeled for months. For months! So why is he going to fall apart now?\u201d\u2026\n\nThey brandish the many predictions of his demise as evidence of their more sophisticated understanding of the Democratic electorate. \u201cHe\u2019s still leading the race nationally. He\u2019s leading in Iowa. It looks like he\u2019s in a dead heat in New Hampshire,\u201d said the top Biden adviser. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the story in New Hampshire isn\u2019t how Bernie Sanders went from sixty to fourteen. And why is it that Biden is beating Warren in Massachusetts? And he\u2019s way ahead in South Carolina. And this is all on the back end of really the most vicious press I think anyone\u2019s experienced. So that to me is a statement of strength. And anyone who\u2019s sitting around waiting for him to fall apart\u2014you know what, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cThe narrative that Biden has staying power is bullshit,\u201d said a senior adviser to one of Biden\u2019s rivals. \u201cIt is just too fucking early. Did we not learn anything from 2016 that polls are shit? The dude does not know what is going on. He is not in fighting shape to beat Trump. You put him on stage together with Trump and they\u2019re both gonna forget shit but Trump is sharper. The dude is just old and it\u2019s showing and they\u2019re fighting every day to make the case that\u2019s not happening but it is.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
