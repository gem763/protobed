We had to draw a walk here, (Josh) Reddick had the single before George\u2019s homer.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees produced two runs in the bottom of the sixth, but Houston added a run in an eighth inning that saw DJ LeMahieu and Torres both fielding errors.\n\n\u2013 Sabathia last stand \u2013\n\nThe dismal eighth for the Yankees included what could have been the last pitches thrown by CC Sabathia in his major league career.\n\nSabathia pitched to four batters, retiring two before departing to an ovation with his team trailing 7-3.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see more about it,\u201d Boone said of Sabathia\u2019s injury, \u201cbut not good with the shoulder.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old Sabathia, who arrived in New York in 2009 and won a World Series title in his first season with the Yankees, was hindered by a troublesome right knee in the regular season, landing on the injured list several times.\n\nAfter returning in September he was sidelined by a sore left shoulder.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who said in February that he would retire at the end of 2019 after 19 years in the major leagues, was applauded by both Yankees fans and Astros players as he left the field.\n\n\u201cI hate to see that for him, I hate to see that for the sport, and we hope he\u2019s OK,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cOur entire dugout was on the top step paying our respects to him trying to gut it out.\n\n\u201cYou can see the impact he\u2019s had on numerous players on our team and me, and everybody else.\u201d", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 George Springer and Carlos Correa hit three-run homers as the Houston Astros beat the New York Yankees 8-3 on Thursday to move one", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/f5d6ac_houston-carlos-correa-george-springer-celebrate-astros-victory-new-york-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
