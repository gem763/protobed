Here in NYC, most people don\u2019t own cars, especially in the inner boroughs. That often means calling a cab when you need to go to the vet or on a trip across town.\n\nProblem is, many drivers don\u2019t want animals in their cars, whether for cleanliness or allergies. Now it seems Uber wants to make traveling with your fur baby easier for a few extra bucks. The company is testing a feature called Uber Pet that lets you hail a fur-friendly driver right from the app for an extra $3 to $5.\n\nCurrently, Uber wants you to call a driver beforehand to ask if you can bring a pet along, something you can only do after requesting a ride. For riders in hurry, that could waste precious time, as many drivers will cancel when they hear you want to bring a dog for a ride, forcing you to request another cab with no guarantee it will be pet-friendly either. If your pet is in the midst of a veterinary emergency, being denied is frustrating and scary.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don\u2019t call beforehand, drivers can be surprised by an unexpected pet they might not be prepared to deal with \u2013 or can\u2019t transport due to allergies. Uber Pet theoretically makes things a less stressful experience on both ends.\n\nDrivers who don\u2019t want to deal with pets can opt out of the feature. But the prospect of making extra cash might compel some who might\u2019ve previously rejected pets to consider allowing them on the ride. The fee would also help cover cleaning expenses for pets with a tendency to shed.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth noting that, in accordance with federal laws, Uber drivers can\u2019t deny or charge a fee for service animals. And before requesting an Uber and relying on chance to find a pet-friendly driver, you should consider calling a local cab service; a dispatcher can easily assign you a pet-friendly driver.\n\nUber Pet is rolling out in Austin, Denver, Nashville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Tampa Bay starting October 16. It\u2019s still in testing, so no word on when it may arrive in other regions.\n\nVia The Verge\n\nRead next: Why Facebook's AI guru isn't scared of killer robots", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FIMG_20180309_133335-e1570733488894.jpg&signature=f9b7dfbb7a528d0f0172a8a83eb8402e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
