Soon after, the cheer squad was placed on probation for the remainder of the football season.\n\nThe fallout has ranged from a rally scheduled for Friday, to tweets urging President Trump to offer the teens his support.\n\n*****The North Carolina High School Athletic Association has put the North Stanly High School cheerleaders on probation for the rest of the football season for their part in holding up a Trump banner during the Aug. 30 game against Piedmont.****** Please do something about it. \u2014 Shopveeluxe (@shop_veeluxe) September 13, 2019\n\n@realDonaldTrump\n\nMr President, cheerleaders were put on probation by the NCHSAA for posing with TRUMP2020 banner at a high school football game.\n\nThey are holding a rally for the cheerleaders at North Stanly HS in NC 09-20-19, 6-8 pm. 1st Amendment under attack! U should come. \u2014 CountryBoy17 (@Jerry23756323) September 14, 2019\n\nRep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) penned a letter on Tuesday to the athletic association, saying he is \u201cappalled\u201d the students were being punished for exercising their First Amendment rights and requests to know what rule had been violated.\n\nThe school district has also received threatening calls about the decision, Miller said. The attention this is getting puzzles her because no student has been suspended or removed by the high school or the school district following the picture\u2019s circulation, she said.\n\n\u201cThey have all participated in every event since,\u201d she said, adding that the word \u201cprobation\u201d was probably not the best word for the warning against the students.\n\nMarilyn Que Tucker, the commissioner of the athletic association, said in a statement that probation isn\u2019t a punishment.\n\n\u201cIt serves as a notice of behavior or action that is against NCHSAA Handbook Policy or contrary to expectations of sportsmanship and proper behavior that could bring additional sanctions, including penalties such as a fine or suspensions, should infractions persist,\u201d she said. \u201cBy NCHSAA Handbook Policy, probation may last for a period of up to one year. In the incidence concerned, no opportunities for participation were limited.\u201d\n\nThe NCHSAA is a voluntary nonprofit group responsible for administering the \u201cstate\u2019s interscholastic athletic program.\u201d\n\nMiller said there have been Facebook threats and calls of threats to the district since the controversy \u201chas grown wings,\u201d and she\u2019s concerned about what attention the students could be facing.\n\nBecause the cheerleaders were in school uniforms, they were acting as representatives of the school, the Stanly County School District said in a statement, and the school cannot be seen to be endorsing a political campaign. Miller said having \u201c2020\u201d on the sign could have easily been interpreted as campaigning. The only time political posters and other printed materials are allowed is on election days, according to the Stanly County Board of Education\u2019s Policy Code.\n\nThe cheerleaders have been asked to not display the sign again, but they haven\u2019t been banned from cheering.\n\nJeremy Onitreb, who told The Washington Post in Facebook messages he is not a student and does not have any relationship with anyone on the cheer squad, is organizing a free-speech rally on Friday across from the school. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 130 people have said they\u2019re going and more than 950 people have said they\u2019re interested in attending the event Onitreb created on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe truth is if there were a Bernie 2020 or Biden 2020 [sign] and conservatives complained, nothing would have been done at all,\u201d Onitreb said. \u201cIt\u2019s only because of the name Trump that there was ever an issue.\u201d\n\nTrump overwhelmingly won Stanly County in the 2016 presidential election, taking home 74 percent of the vote.\n\nMiller said the school district will be monitoring the event as the days draw near to ensure safety.\n\nThe conversation around how much free speech students are allowed is more than 50 years old, said Sanford Ungar, director of the Free Speech Project at Georgetown University, a nonpartisan initiative that examines the state of free speech across the country.\n\nHe pointed to the Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District case as an example, where the court ruled students who wore black arm bands to protest the Vietnam War didn\u2019t lose their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech when they stepped onto school grounds.\n\nIf the North Stanly High cheerleaders wanted to make a case and bring it to federal court, Ungar thinks the school district would lose.\n\n\u201cIt would be very hard to prove that this was a substantial disruption,\u201d he said, noting that private schools might be able to behave like Stanly County Board of Education because they\u2019re not funded by the government.\n\nUngar said he\u2019s seen a resurgence of similar rules because of the current political times.\n\nMiller emphasized the students haven\u2019t faced any disciplinary action, and she\u2019d like for the students to be able to return to their normal lives.\n\n\u201cWe really need to think about this and see the impact that it can have on these children,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re under fire, they can\u2019t be productive within the school building.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA teen was told her MAGA hat violates school code.
