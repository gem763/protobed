The official said confirmation that the IS chief was killed in an explosion is pending. No other details were available. The official was not authorized to discuss the strike and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Donald Trump teased a major announcement, tweeting Saturday night that \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, would say only that the president would be making a \u201cmajor statement\u201d at 9 a.m. ET Sunday\u2026\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s presence in the village, which is a few kilometers away from the Turkish border, would come as a surprise, even if some IS leaders are believed to have fled to Idlib after losing their last sliver of territory in Syria to U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in March. The surrounding areas are largely controlled by a rival of the Islamic State group \u2014 the al-Qaida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2014 although other jihadi groups sympathetic to IS operate there. Unverified video circulated online by Syrian groups appeared to support the Observatory claim that the operation occurred in Barisha.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
