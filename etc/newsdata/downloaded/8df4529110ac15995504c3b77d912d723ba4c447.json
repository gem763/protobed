The president himself denounced it as a sign of Democratic incivility.\n\nIn the months that followed Tlaib\u2019s call to war, Democrats launched a number of investigations into the Trump administration: his alleged welcoming of Russian interference in the 2016 election; his alleged obstruction of the investigation into that interference; his taxes; his granting of security clearances to White House officials; his payments to women with whom he was reported to have had extramarital affairs; his handling of the census, his handling of the crisis at the border with Mexico \u2014 and more.\n\nIt has taken the better part of a year, but the Democrats have finally opened the formal impeachment proceedings that many progressive have long demanded. That inquiry, however, is not rooted in the contentious and time-consuming investigations that have occupied Democrats since the inception of the 116th Congress. Instead, the push to remove Trump from office stems from the very recent revelations about a phone call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the recently elected Ukrainian president.\n\nPresident Trump with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the United Nations General Assembly, Sept. 25, 2019.

Asking a foreign country to contribute something of value to a political campaign is illegal, and critics have charged that scrounging for political dirt on an opponent is exactly that.\n\nIt later came out in press reports, and then in a whistleblower\u2019s complaint, that Trump had ordered $400 million in aid to Ukraine held up, reportedly to pressure Ukraine to follow through with the Biden investigation. Though the White House denies a quid pro quo, diplomats\u2019 texts released Thursday night by the House Intelligence Committee appear to weaken the administration\u2019s argument.\n\nStaffers in the House speaker\u2019s office say that by no means have the other investigations been curtailed. They have merely been subsumed into the impeachment inquiry, those aides say. They explain that because of the national security implications of Trump seeming to trade protection of a critical Eastern European ally for political favors, the Ukraine probe simply must take precedence.\n\nSo while the other investigations may have not fallen by the wayside, Democrats have moved with such speed on the Ukrainian front that even relatively recent history has been forgotten in a rush to figure out the significance of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. Trump himself has only stoked the fires of outrage with his tweets and statement to the press. He has also called for China to investigate the Bidens, leading some to question if he is aware of constitutional constraints on his power.\n\n\u201cThis is way over the line and we have to stop it,\u201d explained an aide to a moderate Democrat who had not been in the pro-impeachment crowd until very recently. \u201cUkraine calls into question the fairness of the 2020 election,\u201d the aide added, \u201cand raises constitutional issues that cannot wait til after another election.\u201d", "description": "It has taken the better part of a year, but the Democrats have finally opened the formal impeachment proceedings that many progressive have long demanded, spurred by recent revelations about a phone call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the recently elected Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1sai4DeUdWuz6KqdIlLDGQ--~B/aD0yNzk2O3c9NDE5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/aab65260-e958-11e9-bf6f-7662591f5105", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
