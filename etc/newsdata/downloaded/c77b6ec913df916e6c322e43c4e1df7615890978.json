We have the rule of law,\u201d prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the verdict in a crowded courtroom.\n\nRafi was lured to the rooftop of the seminary in Sonagazi where her attackers pressed her to withdraw the complaint she had filed with police.\n\nWhen she refused, she was tied up, doused in kerosene and set on fire.\n\nShe suffered burns to 80 percent of her body and died in hospital four days later.\n\nHer death triggered widespread horror across the nation, with protesters in the capital Dhaka staging days of demonstrations seeking \u201cexemplary punishment\u201d for the killers.\n\nThe murder put pressure on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to do more to protect women, with her government ordering some 27,000 schools to set up committees to prevent sexual violence.\n\n\u2018Not a big deal\u2019\n\nRafi had gone to police in late March to report the sexual harassment, and a leaked video shows the local station chief registering her complaint but dismissing it as \u201cnot a big deal\u201d.\n\nPolice said the attackers\u2019 plan had been to pass off her death as suicide, but this failed after Rafi managed to stagger down the stairs while still engulfed in flames.\n\nActivists say many of the women and children who report sexual violence in Bangladesh often suffer a backlash, and that successful prosecutions are rare.\n\nRafi\u2019s case was fast-tracked, with the hearing taking only 62 days at a special tribunal hearing cases of violence against women and children.\n\nMaleka Banu, head of a woman\u2019s rights group, told AFP: \u201cIt is an exemplary punishment. We hope it will send a serious message to the perpetrators and collaborators of sexual violence.\u201d\n\nShe said she hoped the verdict would work as a deterrent and would bring down \u201calarming rise\u201d in sexual violence in the country.\n\nSince the arrest of the principal, at least five more madrasa teachers have been held on charges of rape and sexual assault of their students.\n\nThe head of the Mahila Parishad, another women\u2019s rights group, gave a \u201cguarded welcome\u201d at the quick conclusion of the case, but said more needed to be done to ensure increased convictions for sexual harassment and rape cases.\n\nAccording to that group, there were 731 incidents of sexual violence reported in the first six months of the year, including 592 rapes, 113 gang rapes and 26 women who were killed after being sexually assaulted.\n\nResearcher Rezaur Rahman Lenin said on average more than 200 people are sentenced to death each year in Bangladesh, and as of May around 1,500 people were on death row\n\nThe number of executions carried out is less than 10 a year.\n\nDefence lawyers said they would appeal against Thursday\u2019s verdict in the high court.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WOMEN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
