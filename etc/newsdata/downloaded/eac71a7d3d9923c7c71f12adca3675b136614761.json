We have limited land area, no hydro or geothermal resources and low wind speeds,\" Chan said.\n\nTo address these challenges, Singapore aims to widen the use of solar power in the city state, targeting at least 2-gigawatt (GW) peak of solar power capacity by 2030, which is equivalent to more than 10% of the country's peak electricity demand today, he said.\n\nBesides putting more solar panels on buildings, Singapore plans to double the capacity of floating solar modules in Singapore's water reservoirs from current plans of around a 160 megawatt (MW) peak and develop solutions such as integrating solar panels on vertical surfaces of buildings, Chan said.\n\nThe city state also plans to deploy 200 MW of energy storage systems (ESS) beyond 2025 to augment solar power generation, he said.\n\n\"Over the next 10 years, we expect solar with ESS to reach cost-parity with current gas turbines,\" he said.\n\nStill, he added that will continue to be the dominant fuel for Singapore in the near future due to the time needed to scale up alternative sources for power generation.\n\nSingapore plans to diversify the sources of natural gas into the country and it will continue to develop its role as a trading hub for liquefied natural gas (LNG), Chan said.\n\nThe country is also studying plans to build a second LNG import terminal and will look at issuing more import licences, he added.", "description": "Singapore to stick with natural gas power for time being, expand solar use", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S05N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
