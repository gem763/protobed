The Dodgers can clinch with a win on Monday at 6:40 p.m. as Max Scherzer starts for the Nationals against Rich Hill of the Dodgers. The Nationals trailed in the wild-card game before beating the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\u201cI mean we were like that in the wild-card game, too,\u201d Washington catcher Kurt Suzuki said after Monday\u2019s game. \u201cIt is no different.
