First, publicly owned pharmaceuticals are free of the structural need to appease profit-hungry shareholders and are thus able to focus on public health priorities. They can work hand-in-hand with public health departments to assure that essential medicines\u2014originally researched and developed with significant public spending\u2014are in adequate supply and priced to be accessible to everyone who needs them .\n\nThe U.S. can learn from a number of countries with successful public pharmaceutical industries. China and India\u2019s state-owned drug companies produce a large number of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and sell them worldwide. Sweden\u2019s public company, APL, is one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers in Europe. Brazil\u2019s state-owned labs produce more than 100 essential medications that are offered to low-income patients at little or no charge. Among the innovations developed by Cuba\u2019s state-run biopharmaceutical industry is the lung cancer vaccine CimaVax, which has been used to treat 5,000 patients across the globe, and is being tested in clinical trials in the U.S.\n\nThese examples expose the emptiness of industry arguments that public involvement in the drug industry will stifle innovation. In fact, it\u2019s the increased profit-driven financialization of the industry in recent decades that is most responsible for strangling innovation. The largest U.S. drug manufacturers together have spent far more on marketing than they do on research. They also spend more on stock buybacks: A 2017 Institute for New Economic Thinking study demonstrated that many large drug companies \u201croutinely distribute more than 100 percent of profitsto shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing reserves, selling off assets, taking debt, or laying off employees.\u201d\n\nExperience has shown that innovation is driven by the passion and knowledge of people free to focus solely on healing and hope, without having to worry about what Wall Street thinks. Insulin is a prime example of the difference a public pharmaceutical option could make. Managing diabetes has become a huge expense, consuming 20 percent of U.S. health care spending\u2014and profit extraction by an oligopoly of insulin manufacturers is a key reason. Because prices have more than tripled in the past decade, diabetics put their lives at risk by taking partial doses or skipping doses altogether. There have been four publicly confirmed deaths thus far in 2019 attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis in patients rationing their insulin due to cost, according to the Right Care Alliance.\n\nStates like New York or California, and municipalities like New York City, would be ideal candidates for public pharmaceutical operations. Not only do they have market size, but they have robust research and health systems upon which to build. They also have political leaders and activists primed for leading the kind of democratic engagement that can make these operations accountable to the public and its needs.", "description": "Though seen as insufficient by many states, the proposed deal with Purdue Pharma hints at public alternatives to for-profit drug companies.", "authors": ["Dana Brown", "Isaiah J.
