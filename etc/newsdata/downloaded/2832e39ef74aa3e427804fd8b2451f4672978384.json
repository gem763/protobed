They carried on having a great night, posted pictures of them and so on.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an interesting one, you have to take them at face value I think, you have to listen to what they say about it. They say it\u2019s not what it looks like.\u2019\n\nSharing his own insider knowledge, Piers continued: \u2018I\u2019m told they both like a party, they like a bit of a drink occasionally together and they are a bit boisterous together and that\u2019s literally what it was, which might be the case. I\u2019ve no reason to doubt them.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s one of those things, it\u2019s totally emphatic.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking to Twitter following the publication of the images, Clare shared her own denial, as she wrote: \u2018Unbelievable what nonsense these people will make up!\n\n\u2018Me and Ben messing about squishing up each other\u2019s faces cos that\u2019s how we show affection and some pap tries to twist it in to a crazy story!\n\n\u2018And all before we then have a romantic McDonalds 20 mins later!\u2019\n\nShe tagged Ben in her tweet and he later retweeted and added a kissing emoji.\n\nClare and Ben became engaged in 2013 and married four years later in 2017; they are parents to a six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter.\n\nBen helped England win the World Cup for the first time earlier in 2019, when he made 84 not out in the final before he was chosen to bat in the tie-breaking super over. He also made 135 runs to help England to a thrilling win in the third Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley.\n\nHowever, the past 12 months have seen him found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute by the England and Wales Cricket Board. A sanction came after the England star was involved in a late-night brawl in the streets of Bristol in 2018.\n\nThe player accepted he had punched two men on a night out, but said he was acting in the defence of Mr O\u2019Connor and Mr Barry, who had suffered homophobic abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn court, the sportsman maintained that he heard Mr Ali and Mr Hale directing homophobic abuse at Mr O\u2019Connor and Mr Barry.\n\nAfter two hours of deliberation, he was cleared of affray at Bristol Crown Court but still faced the cricket sanction from the CDC; he was fined \u00a330,000 and banned for eight matches, all of which he had already served by that time.\n\nMetro.co.uk previously contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
