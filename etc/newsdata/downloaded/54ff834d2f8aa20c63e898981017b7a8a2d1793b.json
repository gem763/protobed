(AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)\n\nAll eyes were on activist Greta Thunberg when she bluntly told world leaders: \u201cYou are failing us.\u201d\n\nBut what mattered most at Monday's U.N. climate summit was what China, India and the U.S. actually said \u2014 and what the three biggest emitters of greenhouse gases did not say.\n\nCountries \"once again stopped short of committing to the sort of far-reaching new goals scientists say are needed to rein in emissions,\" as The Post's Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report from the summit.\n\n\u201cGreta Thunberg laid down a clear line in the sand, separating those countries and leaders who are united behind the science from those who continue to place the profits of fossil fuel polluters above the safety of their citizens,\u201d Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. \u201cSadly, most leaders from the world\u2019s largest emitting countries failed this litmus test, dodging their responsibility to step up action as is essential to address the climate emergency we now face.\u201d\n\nAltogether, the top three emitters account for nearly half of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute. Their national policies are what will have the biggest impact on whether the world can hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nThe aim of the Paris accord was for nations to ratchet up their emissions cuts over time. But it relied on voluntary pledges. The Obama administration, which brokered the agreement in 2015, hoped that over time the United States could wield its soft power to press other nations to cut emissions.\n\nPresident Trump's election upended that plan. And this week's climate summit brought into stark relief how countries are still grappling with the fallout of Trump's promise to withdraw from the climate accord:\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. (AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)\n\nChina: China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi took a veiled swing at Trump. He sought to reassure other countries that the promised U.S. withdrawal won't affect China's goals under the international accord.\n\nWhat he said: \u201cChina will faithfully fulfill its obligations \u2026 The withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the international community,\u201d per the New York Times.\n\n\u201cChina will faithfully fulfill its obligations \u2026 The withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the international community,\u201d per the New York Times. What it means: The rub here is China, the world's top emitter, made no new promises to further cut emissions as worries there grow about its slowing economy. And China's original commitment for its emissions to peak no later than 2030 is not enough to begin with. Climate Action Tracker, a consortium of scientists that compares global climate pledges, has rated China's goal as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d for keeping warming below 2 degrees.\n\nIndia: Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to more than doubling India's renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nWhat he said: \u201cIndia today has come not just to talk about the seriousness of this issue, but to present a practical approach and a road map. We believe an ounce of practice is worth more than a tonne of preaching,\u201d per the Indian newspaper the Hindu.\n\n\u201cIndia today has come not just to talk about the seriousness of this issue, but to present a practical approach and a road map. We believe an ounce of practice is worth more than a tonne of preaching,\u201d per the Indian newspaper the Hindu. What it means: India's original Paris goals are compatible with keeping warming under 2 degrees, according to Climate Action Tracker. Still, Modi made no promise to cut its use of coal-fired power generation as some hoped. India is looking to build out all the electricity generation it can as it tries to lift millions out of poverty.\n\nUnited States: After initially deciding to forgo the climate summit, Trump made a surprise, 14-minute appearance, listening to Modi's and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's remarks, according to The Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Anne Gearan.\n\nWhat he said: \u201cI believe in clean air and clean water, very simple,\u201d Trump said when asked why he decided to participate. \u201cWe have the cleanest air; we have the cleanest water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in clean air and clean water, very simple,\u201d Trump said when asked why he decided to participate. \u201cWe have the cleanest air; we have the cleanest water.\u201d What it means: The Trump administration's efforts to walk back regulations on coal plants and automobiles means the United States is set to fall far short of what it needs to do to meet the Paris temperature goal. Other than those off-the-cuff remarks, the United States was virtually invisible during the day.\n\nRead more about the summit here:\n\nClimate and Environment Countries promise more aggressive action at U.N. climate summit, but is it enough?
