It seems counterintuitive to be grateful for something that can limit your mobility, independence and experiences, but the lessons and insights gained from living with disability can be enlightening and empowering. While I won\u2019t say I am grateful to be disabled or for the events that caused my disability, I will say I am extremely grateful for the personal growth and wisdom I gained from them. Disability made me a better and happier human being.\n\nBefore I developed Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (a variant of GBS), I was an unemployed, suicidal alcoholic in an unhappy marriage. I had struggled with persistent depressive disorder since I was young, for which I took medication that only took the edge off. I had attempted suicide six months prior, and struggled with trying to avoid a second attempt. Having missed several opportunities to build a fulfilling career, I was terminated from yet another dead-end job, and had given up on searching for another. I languished at home in front of the computer, smoking cigarettes and drowning my angst in beer. My two-year marriage was ending, and I didn\u2019t have the energy or desire to heal myself, let alone my relationships.\n\nRelated:\u200b 4 Lessons 'Walk. Ride. Rodeo.'

The depression was at its all-time worst, and even though I was confined to bed, I managed to find ways to try to end my suffering, so frequently that it was recommended that my parents sign a DNR because I \u201cobviously wanted to die.\u201d\n\nAnd then it began to change. It was right around the time when I went from resignation about my future to acceptance of it. My marriage improved. My husband didn\u2019t leave me (as many friends had advised), but instead stuck by me and supported me in so many important ways. My family gathered around me and I began to see the ordeal through their eyes. I began to have a better understanding and sympathy for what they endured. Spending time around other patients in rehab and group homes opened my eyes to others who were struggling as I was. My empathy and compassion for others grew, and I developed the ability to see others\u2019 pain even while struggling with my own.\n\nRelated:\u200b When Kids Ask or Comment About People With Disabilities\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t work, I no longer felt the pressure of trying to \u201cfind myself\u201d through career goals. I had more time to explore how I could contribute to society in a way that fulfilled me. I started giving speeches, sharing my experiences with the hope of helping others cope. I began a Facebook page and a blog in order to advocate and spread awareness. I spent more time on creative hobbies and left the house more often, gaining more and more independence and confidence. My mood improved and the depression lifted. With that, I had more energy to give to others, and I started to grow in leaps and bounds.\n\nBefore I became disabled, I was typical of many other able-bodied people, compassionate and supportive of the disabled community, but still ignorant of the deeper issues. I would think and say ableist things like: \u201cI agree that \u2018the handicapped\u2019 should have more rights, but we shouldn\u2019t have to change everything to accommodate them,\u201d or \u201cThat person doesn\u2019t look disabled to me.\u201d Suddenly finding my backside in a wheelchair and my body far less functional than it used to be was a rude awakening to what people with disabilities face on a daily basis.\n\nRelated:\u200b Why I Wrote a Children's Book About Disabilities\n\nI quickly learned about many different kinds of disabilities and their common, as well as unique obstacles. I began to understand invisible disabilities and the societal struggles people with them face. I learned appropriate language to use when discussing disability, and the dangers of inspiration porn. I became an advocate myself, and continue to use my own talents and skills to spread awareness and ideas of inclusion.\n\nBecause I was an educated, able-bodied, straight, Caucasian, cisgender woman from a middle-class family, I had many privileges I was unaware of until I became disabled. I was still a kind, compassionate person, but did not have a deep enough understanding of those who are considered \u201cother\u201d and my role in it all.", "description": "Jennifer Burgmann discusses what she is grateful about in her life since she became disabled.", "authors": ["Jennifer Burgmann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S0DOBlyGNyXg.t8rnYeZVw--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/d067b2d8392c84ac677518865d28763e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
