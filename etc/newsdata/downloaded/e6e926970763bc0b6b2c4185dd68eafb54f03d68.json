REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nTurkey has stepped up its air and artillery strikes on Kurdish militia in northeast Syria, escalating an offensive that has drawn warnings of a humanitarian disaster and also raised the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Ankara.\n\nThe European Union, which Turkey still formally aspires to join despite its growing criticism of Ankara\u2019s human rights record, had already condemned the Turkish offensive but has been infuriated by Erdogan\u2019s threats to send refugees to Europe.\n\n\u201cWe will never accept that refugees are weaponised and used to blackmail us,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, said on Twitter. \u201cPresident Erdogan\u2019s threats ... are totally out of place.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also accused Erdogan of blackmail and said the military operation should immediately end. France proposed economic sanctions on Turkey, a NATO ally, while Sweden\u2019s parliament demanded an EU arms embargo.\n\nFurther piling pressure on Ankara ahead of an EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on Monday and a summit of EU leaders on Thursday, Cyprus and Greece urged economic sanctions against Turkey over Turkish gas drilling in waters off southern Cyprus.\n\nA senior EU official said the European Union was spending 6 billion euros ($6.63 billion) on supporting the Syrian refugees currently living in camps inside Turkey, adding that \u201cto use this as leverage is totally unacceptable\u201d.\n\nAnkara says the aim of its assault in Syria is to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as linked to militant Kurdish separatists in Turkey. It says it wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil and that Europe should pay for it, a plan the EU has rejected outright.\n\nThe YPG is the main fighting element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the principal ally of the United States in Syria against Islamic State. U.S. Republican lawmakers have joined their Democrat opponents in criticising President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from the region and are now discussing sanctions against Turkey over its offensive.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nBrussels relies on Ankara to curb the arrival of refugees into Europe following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean sea route after more than 1 million people entered the bloc.\n\nFrance\u2019s European affairs minister said Paris wanted next week\u2019s EU summit to specifically discuss sanctions over Turkey\u2019s offensive in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will not remain powerless when faced with a situation that is shocking for civilians, the SDF and the stability of the region,\u201d Amelie de Montchalin told France Inter, adding that the possibility of sanctions was \u201con the table\u201d.\n\nSo far, EU discussions of sanctions on Turkey have focused on Turkish oil and gas drilling off Cyprus and on the targeting of specific individuals and companies.\n\nBut a French diplomatic source said Europe would look \u201cabsurd\u201d if the option of sanctions over Ankara\u2019s offensive was not discussed. The source said EU foreign ministers would discuss the issue at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just limit it (the sanctions talk) to drilling. and there are similarities on both issues,\u201d the source added.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nThat could lay the ground for EU leaders to weigh sanctions and possibly impose them, although any decision needs consensus and EU diplomats cautioned that many governments were wary of further angering Erdogan, given Turkey\u2019s size and importance.\n\nHungary, which has refused to take in people fleeing Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war, is against sanctions and blocked an EU statement on Wednesday criticising Turkey, two diplomats said.\n\n($1 = 0.9046 euros)", "description": "EU governments threatened sanctions against Turkey on Friday over its offensive in Syria, angrily rejecting President Tayyip Erdogan's warning that he would \"open the gates\" and send 3.6 million refugees to Europe if they did not back him.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439760137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1O3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
