BP flagged earlier this month it would take a non-cash charge of $2 billion to $3 billion in the quarter as it gets closer to disposing of assets worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.\n\nSo far this year, BP\u2019s proceeds from divestments reached $1.4 billion.\n\nBP last year acquired BHP\u2019s U.S. shale assets for $10.25 billion that turned BP into one of the largest shale oil drillers. It also announced the sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp Energy Co for $5.6 billion.\n\nBP shares were down 1.2% by 0928 GMT, compared with a 0.33% decline for the broader FTSE index .FTSE.\n\nThird-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company\u2019s definition of net income, fell 40% from the year earlier period to $2.3 billion. That exceeded a forecast of $1.73 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts and compared to $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn a sign of confidence, BP eliminated a scrip dividend for the quarter which allows investors to get shares instead of cash, a measure used during the industry downturn.\n\nHURRICANE\n\nOil and gas production, excluding BP\u2019s share from its 19.75% stake in Russia\u2019s Rosneft, was down 2.5% from a year earlier at 2.568 million barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of maintenance at several high-margin fields and a two-week disruption to production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Barry.\n\nBP said production in the fourth quarter would be higher than in the previous quarter as maintenance winds down.\n\nOn the oil demand outlook, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters demand remained under pressure globally from trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nThe weakness in oil and gas production was offset by a strong performance in BP\u2019s refining and chemicals businesses and higher than expected earnings from Rosneft, which helped lower BP\u2019s tax rate.\n\nBP\u2019s capital spending was set to be below $16 billion in 2019, Gilvary said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of BP is seen at a petrol station in Kloten, Switzerland October 3, 2017.
