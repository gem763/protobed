It is unclear if Fruman also appeared at the event.\n\nThe photos from the overseas visit further show the extent of Giuliani's involvement with the pair and how his links to Parnas and Fruman and their charity brought him into contact with Ukrainian-connected individuals at a time he was seeking to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who allegedly aided Giuliani's efforts to dig up political dirt on Biden, pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Wednesday to charges that they funneled foreign money to US campaigns.\n\nThe two were arrested earlier this month attempting to leave the country and were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nGiuliani told CNN in an email he did \"not recall meeting anyone associated with Firtash\" and that \"part of the trip\" was paid for by a podcast that has yet to launch. He added the trip \"included two meetings with an unrelated client, a luncheon speech and three 45-minute interviews we submitted and haven't yet been used.\"\n\nGiuliani declined to provide any other details on the podcast --- such as which individuals or company are backing it financially -- other than a claim that he also did interviews for it during a July trip to Albania.\"\n\n\"Busy days and all completely innocent,\" he said. \"I'd be interested to see how this is twisted.\"\n\nFruman did not comment. John Dowd, a lawyer for Fruman, who previously served as a lawyer for Trump in the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference, repeatedly declined to comment. A lawyer for Parnas did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPhotos reveal who was with Giuliani\n\nGiuliani and Parnas can be seen chatting in the Yankees' dugout with retired baseball greats Dave Winfield and Bobby Bonilla. In other photos before the game, Giuliani can be seen with both Parnas and Aaron Boone, the manager of the Yankees.\n\nGiuliani reportedly said in a deposition related to his divorce he was paid to go on the trip by the still unlaunched podcast, which he also later told CNN in an email. Maria Ryan, a \"good friend\" of Giuliani's claimed in several tweets she and Giuliani, whom she called \"a \"business partner\" would be conducting interviews with executives from the league, Yankees, and Red Sox during the trip. Giuliani tweeted the podcast would be, \"truly great nformatie[sic].\"\n\nRyan is a New Hampshire-based health care executive. It is unclear what the podcast is about. Ryan did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nA spokesman for the Yankees told CNN that Giuliani purchased four tickets for the game from the Yankees, but that the league handled on-field credentialing. It is unclear how Parnas and Fruman ended up on the field.\n\n\"Neither Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman were credentialed for the games in London. I am unaware of how they ended up on the field,\" MLB spokesman Pat Courtney told CNN in an email.\n\nA Ukraine charity tied to Parnas and Fruman\n\nDuring the visit, Giuliani also appeared at a luncheon to benefit the Ukrainian Jewish community of Anatevka, a settlement near Kiev that helps Jews forced to flee Eastern Ukraine due to the ongoing conflict there.\n\nPhotos posted on Parnas' Instagram account, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video on the Wall Street Journal's website , indicate the event was a \"founders' luncheon\" for the \"British Friends of Anatevka,\" featuring \"honorary mayor\" Rudolph Giuliani.\n\nFisher did not respond to requests for comment. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Firtash's attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, did not say if Giuliani met with any Firtash associates during the trip. Toensing and diGenova did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Corallo previously served as spokesman for Trump's legal team during the Russia investigation. Greenberg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is unclear who else attended the event. Friends of Anatevka declined to answer questions about the event through their Facebook page and later said they would forward any questions to Greenberg of Curzon PR.\n\nCLARIFICATION AND UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect that, after publication, Corallo clarified his position as spokesman for Toensing and diGenova, and not for Firtash himself. It has also been updated to reflect that Toensing and diGenova did not respond to CNN's request for comment.", "description": "Photos from a trip to London in June 2019 show President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and a now-indicted associate Lev Parnas having a VIP experience at two baseball games between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.", "authors": ["Andrew Kaczynski"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191026131549-giuliani-yankees-aaron-boone-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
