Only recently have prices moved below the cresting moving average line.\n\nTrading volume appears to be light but the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a rising pattern from December signaling more aggressive buying.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been weakening for several months and has diverged from the price action. The MACD oscillator is now close to a sell signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of LDOS, below, we see a mixed picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line but they also look extended above that line. When prices get too far away from the 40-week line they can tend to be drawn back to it.\n\nThe movement of the OBV line matches the price move and the MACD oscillator on this time frame has crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of LDOS, below, we can see some distribution (selling) and a potential downside price target of $76.\n\nBottom-line strategy: I am not sure where LDOS is going in the long run -- $100 seems like a good target. In the short run LDOS could correct a bit lower to the $76 area.", "description": "Leidos Could Correct a Little Before Its Next Rally Phase...LDOS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Leidos Could Correct A Little Before Its Next Rally Phase", "Here'S Where We Think The Defense", "Aviation Stock Is Going In The Long Run.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1086bce3-8e9f-11e8-9c19-a3c3a4296d66.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
