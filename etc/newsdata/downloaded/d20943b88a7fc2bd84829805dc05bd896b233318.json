So much of it is opinion wrapped up as fact, or selective facts to evoke emotions,\u201d said Obama, who was interviewed by Splunk Inc. SPLK, -1.52% CEO Doug Merritt for about an hour.\n\nWith a digital fire hose of data, compounded by decisions that require rapid-fire responses from the White House, any person or organization needs a diversity of viewpoints as well as \u201ca process you have confidence in\u201d that properly sifts and sorts data, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I would advise is to not watch TV or read social media,\u201d Obama said in a not-too-subtle dig at President Donald Trump, which prompted laughter and applause.\n\n\u201cWe were some of the earliest adapters\u201d of new technological tools and social media during 2008 campaign, Obama said. \u201cWe did a lot of data analysis on deploying volunteers, turning out the vote. I benefited from an entire war room of folks who developed high-level skills from Silicon Valley. We understood the benefit of Big Data, good data. So we thought, how do we infuse that into the federal government?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of discussion about what health data sets were appropriate to share without violating people\u2019s privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the least efficient system we have but accounts for one-sixth of the economy.\u201d\n\nBig data, he added, could help minimize waste in the health-care industry, as well as improve everyday headaches like gridlock traffic in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nMerritt submitted 20 questions to Obama\u2019s team before the company\u2019s event on data management, though none of them were politically tinged at Obama\u2019s request.\n\nBut the elephant in the room -- in this case, San Francisco\u2019s 500-seat August Hall -- was the inevitable showdown between the federal government and four of tech\u2019s biggest players over how they collect, handle, and monetize personal information. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee demanded email and other documentation from the CEOs of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.28%, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.94%, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +0.23% GOOG, +0.27% Google, and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.03%.\n\nObama did not comment directly on the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigations into those companies, but he touched on the importance of what he calls \u201cgood data.\u201d\n\nTechnology can enhance and hinder personal relationships. \u201cThat\u2019s what you in Silicon Valley have to be concerned about,\u201d he said. \u201cSome poll suggested 20% of millennials said they had no friends. How we manage that for our own mental health and democracy is so important.\u201d\n\nSocial media, in essence, has helped create bubbles of people sharing like-minded opinions.\n\nThe tone wasn\u2019t entirely somber about the dangers of data, decision making, and culture. The former president weighed in on the upcoming NBA season. \u201cI love the (Golden State) Warriors. I know Steph (Curry),\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a great example of a place that built a great culture. Don\u2019t worry about how they\u2019ll do (this season). They had a great run.\u201d\n\nThe 44th president\u2019s appearance kicked off a busy week for his family in Silicon Valley, where they have cultivated a strong following among tech executives, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to speak off-the-record in appearances next week at Dropbox Inc. DBX, +0.38% and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT, +0.82% LinkedIn, both in San Francisco. She\u2019s also set to appear at AT&T Inc.\u2019s T, -1.08% Business Summit in Dallas in November.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d a clearly bemused Barack Obama said when informed his wife would be in town next week.\n\nUnderscoring the growing influence of technology as an economic, cultural, and fundraising tool, President Trump on Tuesday briefly ducked into the Portola Valley, Calif., home of former Sun Microsystems Inc. CEO Scott McNealy to raise $3 million in a fundraiser luncheon.", "description": "The slippery slope of data has never been more crucial, former President Barack Obama warns in a far-ranging fireside chat at a tech conference in San...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR371_Obama_ZG_20190916112913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
