While it\u2019s refreshing that this topic is receiving more attention, some of us remain skeptical that the status quo will ever change.\n\nWhy the pessimistic view? Because zebras throwing as many flags as possible has become an ingrained part of referee culture. That is, refs at all levels of football (and basketball) seem to be rewarded (or at least receive no penalty for) being foul happy.\n\nConversely, refs who may be more inclined to let them play, to keep their hankies in their pockets if violations are borderline or make no difference to the outcomes of plays, seem to be few and far between in a league where the number of penalties called set a record in 2018.\n\nThe closest analogy is to Washington, D.C., where new laws and rules are constantly being created, and where the bureaucrats who enforce said rules are rewarded with jobs, power, and career advancement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this nanny state, the sheeple have increasingly been conditioned to yield to those who \u201cprotect\u201d them\u2014or, in the arena of sports, to those who enforce rules that are \u201cvital to protecting the integrity of the game.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the system protects our rule/law enforcers. In pro-sports, coaches and players are often prohibited from criticizing referees\u2019 calls.\n\nEnter Tom Brady, the NFL\u2019s all-time best quarterback and probably the league\u2019s most influential player. After a recent Thursday night game replete with penalties, Brady could no longer contain himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning off this game\u2026can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore. Just let us play!!!!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nStop the presses! Not only was this sentiment shared by millions of Americans, it was being voiced by someone who actually mattered.\n\nNot long after Brady fired his salvo, the outcome of this week\u2019s Lions-Packers Monday Night Football contest was again determined by the refs calling penalties where none existed. Afterwards, syndicated talk show host Jim Rome let loose with one of his hot takes.\n\nIn the intro to his Tuesday show, Rome railed against the officiating crew of Clete Blakeman for handing the game to the Packers:", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NFL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
