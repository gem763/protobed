As I revealed last week, Dara has been invited with her two-year-old son Wolfie, who is to be Edo\u2019s best man\n\nBeatrice is in the happy position of being able to opt out of Royal protocol as she has dropped to ninth in line to the throne since the birth in May of Prince Harry\u2019s son Archie.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have to ask the Queen for permission to marry her fiance, Italian property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and she is not obliged to endure the pomp of a procession.\n\nNor will she have to face the embarrassment of potentially getting turned down by the BBC for TV coverage of the event, as Eugenie was. With no procession, there will be no pressure to have the occasion broadcast.\n\nA low-key affair will also cut costs \u2013 Eugenie came under fire after it emerged her wedding cost the taxpayer about \u00a32 million to police.\n\nBeatrice is said to be relieved that she can get on with a quieter, private wedding, possibly in a marquee at her parents\u2019 home, the relatively modest Royal Lodge at Windsor. She has insisted to friends that she genuinely hasn\u2019t yet decided where it will be, but hopes a smaller venue will keep things a little more casual.\n\nThoughtful Bea also hopes that a lack of pomp won\u2019t rub Edoardo\u2019s ex-fiance Dara Huang\u2019s nose in the occasion too much. As I revealed last week, Dara has been invited with her two-year-old son Wolfie, who is to be Edo\u2019s best man.\n\nOne of Beatrice\u2019s friends told me last week: \u2018Beatrice has said she and Edo are looking at alternative venues because she wants something different. The wedding will not be in Italy and from what they are saying it won\u2019t be in St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, either.\n\n\u2018There have been three big Royal weddings there in the past year or so and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what Bea wants. Edo has a child, there\u2019s the situation with his ex, and Beatrice might just feel something more low-key might be more fitting.\u2019\n\nPrincess Beatrice in August also become a full-time 'stepmother' to Edoardo's two-year-old son (pictured with Eduardo) while Dara was working overseas\n\nBeatrice is said to be relieved that she can get on with a quieter, private wedding, possibly in a marquee at her parents\u2019 home, the relatively modest Royal Lodge at Windsor (pictured, Bea and Edo in May)\n\nA highly-successful architect with her own design company and international clients, Dara also has to travel a great deal.\n\nPrincess Beatrice in August become a full-time 'stepmother' to Edoardo's two-year-old son while Dara was working overseas.\n\nEdo, 34, moved in with Bea, 31, ensuring there's plenty of free child care on hand for his toddler Christopher Woolf, known as Wolfie.\n\nArchitect Dara, 37, was said to be thrilled with the arrangement and told Bea's sister Eugenie as much when she bumped into her at a party recently.\n\nA close friend tells me: 'Dara thinks Beatrice is wonderful with Wolfie. She's a natural.'\n\nBeatrice, who has known Edoardo for several years, is said to have begun dating the millionaire after meeting him again at Eugenie's wedding in October last year.\n\nHe is the son of former Olympic skier Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi and Nikki Shale, is a count himself, and has been a friend of the York children for some time before getting engaged to Beatrice.\n\nHe was educated at the prestigious Radley school in Oxfordshire before studying for a Master's in politics at Edinburgh.\n\nHis mother is Nikki Shale, who split with his count father when he was young.\n\nThe couple, who will tie the knot in 2020, shared a series of down-to-earth photographs after their engagement taken by sister Princess Eugenie in the grounds of Windsor Great Park.\n\nBeatrice's mother Sarah, better known as 'Fergie', said she and her husband Andrew are overjoyed at the news (the couple are pictured together in July)\n\nIn stark contrast, Princess Eugenie and husband Jack Brookbank's official engagement pictures back in January 2018 were taken in the Picture Gallery at Buckingham Palace by Press Association photographer, Jonathan Brady.\n\nThe Queen's granddaughter and Edoardo released a statement regarding their 11-month whirlwind romance and said: 'We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement.\n\n'We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to actually be married.\n\nBeatrice's mother Sarah, better known as 'Fergie', said she and her husband Andrew are overjoyed at the news.\n\nShe wrote: 'I know what mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news. Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great son-in-laws.'\n\nPrincess Eugenie may have been waiting generously for her sister Beatrice to reveal her engagement to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi before making an announcement of her own.\n\nWhispers reach me that, almost a year after their wedding, Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank are ready to start a family but haven\u2019t talked about it because of a genuine wish not to upstage Bea.\n\nIn the Royal Family, timing is everything. Eugenie had to wait to marry Jack until after her cousin Prince Harry had tied the knot.\n\nAlas, Eugenie\u2019s big day was reportedly overshadowed when Harry and Meghan revealed to some family and friends at the nuptials that they were expecting their first child.\n\nThis might explain why Beatrice\u2019s engagement news was timed \u2013 or should I say mistimed \u2013 at the beginning of Harry and Meghan\u2019s African tour.", "description": "Beatrice is in the happy position of being able to opt out of Royal protocol as she has dropped to ninth in line to the throne since the birth in May of Prince Harry's son Archie.", "authors": ["Charlotte Griffiths For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19634984-0-image-a-76_1570911255173.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
