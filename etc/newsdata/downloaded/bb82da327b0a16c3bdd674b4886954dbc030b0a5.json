Look no further than Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey declared: \u201cWe know Donald Trump\u2019s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that.\u201d He claimed that America has \u201ca president that [sic] can\u2019t condemn white supremacy.\u201d\n\nMARK LEVIN RIPS 2020 DEM FIELD AS 'WEAKEST CANDIDATES I'VE EVER SEEN': 'SO IMMATURE -- ALL OF THEM'\n\n\u201cAnyone who supports this [President Trump\u2019s immigration policies] is supporting racism,\u201d said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u201cThe only people, though, who actually buy into this president\u2019s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don\u2019t know any.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas shouted: \u201cWe have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you\u2019ve spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris of California hectored, \u201cand that is why we\u2019ve gotten nothing done.\u201d\n\nThese and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast. I repeatedly have documented these statements, events, and actions in tremendous detail, most recently in a piece in the National Review.\n\nJust last Tuesday, Trump addressed the 2019 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference at Washington\u2019s Renaissance Hotel.\n\nThe president did not merely breeze by for a photo op. He spent a full 30 minutes speaking with black educators and detailing his policies to assist scholars, professors and administrators at these 101 public and private campuses \u2013 most with large, if not majority, black student bodies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cFor more than 180 years, HBCUs have strengthened our country and called America to greatness,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYour institutions have been pillars of excellence in higher education and the engines of advancement for African-American citizens.\u201d\n\nTrump celebrated distinguished HBCU alumni, including such noted Americans as educator Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Airmen who helped win World War II, civil rights leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and others.\n\nTrump specified the steps that he and his administration have taken to advance HBCUs, including the following:\n\nMany HBCU students attend summer school. HBCU presidents appealed to President Barack Obama for eight years to allow year-round Pell Grants for college students. Obama didn\u2019t lift a finger. Trump approved this in less than two years and gave HBCU students fresh financial aid options. Trump added: \u201cI signed legislation to increase federal funding for HBCUs by a record 13 percent.\u201d (Fiscal hawks might bristle at that number, but no one can call such a spending hike bigoted.)\n\nThe Trump administration forgave the debts of Dillard, Xavier and other New Orleans-area HBCUs, which have struggled since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe White House has pressed NASA to recruit HBCU students interested in space careers.\n\nThe Departments of Labor and Education are collaborating with HBCUs to expand apprenticeships for their students.\n\nForty students have been chosen as the 2019 White House HBCU Competitiveness Scholars.\n\nIn his fifth week in office, Trump explained: \u201cI signed an executive order to move the federal HBCU initiative to the White House, right where it belongs.\u201d\n\nThese and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast.\n\nThese and other pro-HBCU reforms unfold just steps away from the Oval Office, not in some far-flung federal outpost.\n\nBeyond this, Trump repeatedly spoke about national unity, including when he said: \u201cEvery day of my presidency, we\u2019ll strive to give every child, of every background and every race, religion and creed, the best chance to reach that beautiful American Dream.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of a racist?\n\nNaturally, this huge story generated tremendous attention among the Old Guard media. Wrong!\n\nTrump\u2019s half-hour address garnered exactly zero minutes and zero seconds of coverage on that night\u2019s ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs.\n\nAlas, Trump stomped on his own potential HBCU headlines by firing National Security Adviser John Bolton via Twitter at 11:58 a.m., just two-and-a-half hours before his speech. Still, despite that major development, ABC, CBS and NBC could have spared a moment or two to mention Trump\u2019s HBCU presentation, at least fleetingly.\n\nAfter all, the networks somehow found time for such urgent developments as ABC\u2019s 15 seconds on the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders doubling their pay, CBS\u2019 22 seconds on the health benefits of twice-weekly naps, and NBC\u2019s one minute and 34 seconds on a 9-year-old Ohio boy who was \u201clunch-shamed\u201d on his birthday.\n\n\u201cThe national news media have no interest in highlighting any facts which might undermine the \u2018Trump is a racist\u2019 narrative,\u201d the Media Research Center\u2019s Brent Baker observed. MRC kindly furnished this statistical confirmation of the networks\u2019 irresponsible public affairs coverage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTuesday afternoon, Trump reached out to blacks \u2013 as he has many times before. On cue, the media buried the story. And, playing their part perfectly, top Democrats two days later screamed: \u201cRACIST!\u201d\n\nThis is exactly why America is choking on the poison of division. And the corrupt fake news media are right in the middle of this \u201cDJT = KKK\u201d venom \u2013 pumping it out by the gallon.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DEROY MURDOCK", "description": "Democrats love to call President Trump a \"racist.\" It's a lie fanned by the Old Guard media that contributes to the poison of division choking America.", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6086058816001_6086053698001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
