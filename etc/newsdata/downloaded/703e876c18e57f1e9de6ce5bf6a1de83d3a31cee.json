DEMOCRATS have also seen positive signs in cases aimed at extracting Mueller grand jury information.\n\n-- SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI sent her House Democratic colleagues this letter. The House Dem call is at 4:15 p.m. today -- not 4:30 as we said in the AM edition.\n\n2) Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine MARIE YOVANOVITCH arrived on Capitol Hill around 10:20 this morning. She avoided reporters, and entered into the House\u2019s secure suite of rooms through a back stairway. More from Kyle Cheney, Andrew Desiderio and Quint Forgey\n\n-- IF PAST IS PRECEDENT, Yovanovitch will spend hours with the committees. It\u2019s notable that a current member of the government is testifying despite State Department instructions to the contrary -- especially one who was ousted from her role as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n-- WE\u2019RE ALREADY HEARING WHAT HAPPENED \u2026 NYT\u2019S SHARON LAFRANIERE and NICK FANDOS: \u201cMarie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled as the American ambassador to Ukraine, testified to impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official told her that President Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though the department believed she had \u2018done nothing wrong.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn a closed-door deposition that could further fuel calls for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, Ms. Yovanovitch delivered a scathing indictment of his administration\u2019s conduct of foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment, threatening to undermine the nation\u2019s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service. \u2026\n\n\u201cShe said that John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, told her this spring that she had \u2018done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u2019\u201d NYT \u2026 The full testimony, courtesy of the NYT\n\n-- SPEAKING OF JOHN SULLIVAN, Trump nominated him to be ambassador to Russia this afternoon.\n\n3) U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. GORDON SONDLAND will testify Thursday in closed session. This is another member of the administration coming to Capitol Hill. We have no idea what he is going to say, but he is a political appointee of the president.\n\nGood Friday afternoon.

Esper and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar \u2018spoke by phone where they discussed the situation in northeast Syria,\u2019 Hoffman said in a statement.\n\n\u201c\u2018As part of the call, Secretary Esper strongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in northeastern Syria in order to increase the possibility that the United States, Turkey and our partners could find a common way to deescalate the situation before it becomes irreparable.\u2019 Esper \u2018also reiterated his strong concern that, despite U.S. force protection measures, Turkey's actions could harm U.S. personnel in Syria,\u2019 Hoffman said.\u201d POLITICO\n\nNOT ENDING ALL WARS! -- \u201cTrump sending 2,000 more troops to Saudi Arabia,\u201d by Wes Morgan: \u201cDefense Secretary Mark Esper authorized the deployment of two fighter squadrons, two batteries of Patriot missiles, a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system, and an Air Force headquarters unit \u2018at the request of U.S. Central Command,\u2019 Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.

His allies aren\u2019t so sure,\u201d by Darren Samuelsohn and Burgess Everett: \u201c[B]ehind the scenes, Republicans and Trump\u2019s informal circle of advisers are tempering the president\u2019s bravado, expressing concern over whether the president can truly count on a GOP-led Senate to keep him in office. While Senate Republicans relish the president\u2019s judicial appointments and many of his domestic policies, they\u2019ve never fully embraced Trump\u2019s style of politics. And that raises eyebrows in Trump world. \u2026\n\n\u201cMany Republicans have yet to decide how to react. \u2026 Some Republican senators are starting to coalesce behind a wrist-slapping strategy with Trump. What Trump did was not right, they say, but neither is impeachment. It\u2019s movement away from Trump, but not in any way that has Senate Republican officials worried about defections.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cLarry Hogan comes out in support of Trump impeachment inquiry,\u201d by Abbey Marshall\n\n-- \u201cHow Trump-Country Democrat Rep. Max Rose Got to Impeachment,\u201d by New York\u2019s David Freedlander: \u201c\u2018I do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u2019 he said when he at last made his way through the crowd and settled in at a back table at Jody\u2019s. \u2018But no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u201cprove it.\u201d But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201c[U]ltimately it\u2019s about winning \u2014 especially winning elections in Trump-loving places. Today that means keeping your powder dry for the impeachment inquiry so that more people will trust that it is carried out faithfully.\u201d Chock-full of money quotes: New York\n\n-- MICHAEL CALDERONE: \u201cReporters call out the State Department for \u2018lockdown\u2019 on Ukraine\u201d: \u201cState Department reporters are protesting what they see as unprecedented stonewalling of questions surrounding the Ukraine scandal that led to the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, with their correspondents\u2019 association calling on senior officials to break the impasse.\u201d POLITICO\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER\u2019S LONG SHADOW -- \u201cTrump ending U.S. role as worldwide leader on refugees,\u201d by Ted Hesson: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is dramatically slashing the number of refugees allowed into the United States to an all-time low, but the real number of refugees set to be admitted into the country could be far lower than the official limit \u2026\n\n\u201c[T]he administration has created a new system of limits for different types of refugees and has effectively stopped recruiting new refugees into the pipeline. Since resettlement usually takes years, the impact could last well beyond the Trump era. \u2026 The moves may be popular with Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant base, but critics warn that they endanger the lives of tens of thousands of people.\u201d POLITICO\n\nDISINFORMATION BATTLE -- \u201cHow Trump is winning the fight on \u2018baseless\u2019 ads,\u201d by Cristiano Lima: \u201cDemocrats say the dominant online platforms are once again bending or ignoring their own policies against targeted harassment, hate speech and misinformation when it comes to Trump \u2014 a decision that will have major implications for the political ads that tens of millions of voters see between now and Election Day. \u2026\n\n\u201cFree speech advocates say the Democrats\u2019 calls for Silicon Valley to play political gatekeeper risk trampling on constitutionally protected political discourse. \u2026 The companies have offered similar explanations of their policies, even as they have faced rising pressure to squelch hate, bullying and fake news.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cTeamsters kick off endorsement process as 2020 Democrats race for labor support,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg: \u201cTo be eligible for the Teamsters\u2019 official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.\n\n\u201cThe Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa. \u2026 [President James] Hoffa didn\u2019t specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.\u201d CNN\n\n-- MARIANNE WILLIAMSON chats with Illinois Playbook\u2019s Shia Kapos: Williamson said she is staying in the 2020 presidential race \u201cas long as people come to hear me, as long as people send in money, and as long as I feel I\u2019m having a deep and meaningful conversation with voters.\u201d\n\nON AGE CONCERNS: \u201cYou know, someone being too young to know things is as problematic as someone being too old to remember things.\u201d Full interview\n\nFRIDAY READ -- MICHAEL GRUNWALD in Pescadero, Calif.: \u201cTom Steyer Thinks His Ranch Can Save the Planet\u201d: \u201cSteyer and his quintessentially California wife, the banker/social justice activist Kathryn (Kat) Taylor, are the proud proprietors of TomKat Ranch, a cutting-edge regenerative grazing operation on 1,800 acres of coastal scrub and grassy hills \u2026 Steyer is quietly producing beef \u2026 He\u2019s also financing exhaustive scientific research on the property, hoping to prove that ranching in harmony with nature, without lethal chemicals to protect grass or corn feedlots to fatten cattle, can pull carbon from the air, hold water on the land, and produce enough delicious meat to disrupt the beef-industrial complex. \u2026\n\n\u201cTomKat\u2019s regenerative approach has provided clear environmental benefits, reducing erosion and enhancing plant diversity at the ranch, and its scientific monitoring program has already been extended throughout the state. But there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s sequestering more carbon in the soil to help the climate, much less demonstrating a viable business model for ranchers who aren\u2019t billionaires.\u201d POLITICO Magazine\n\nEYES ON THE SKIES -- \u201cDamning Report Faults Boeing and F.A.A. on 737 Max Certification,\u201d by NYT\u2019s David Gelles and Natalie Kitroeff: \u201cBoeing failed to adequately explain to regulators a new automated system that contributed to two crashes of the 737 Max, and the Federal Aviation Administration lacked the capability to effectively analyze much of what Boeing did share about the new plane.\n\n\u201cThose are among the findings in a damning report from a multiagency task force that the F.A.A. convened to scrutinize the Max\u2019s certification process after the second plane crashed in March. The New York Times obtained a draft copy of the report, which is expected to be made public on Friday.\u201d NYT\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
