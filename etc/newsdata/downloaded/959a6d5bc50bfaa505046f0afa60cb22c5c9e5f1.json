Extensive leaks have shown we\u2019re expecting two models: one that looks a lot like the old one box, and another that\u2019s a compact dongle. Otherwise, the differences don\u2019t appear to be huge. The larger device is expected to sport a more powerful Tegra X1+ processor, a more comfortable remote, USB-C, 4K upscaling, and Dolby Vision support. As reported by Android Police, the bigger unit is expected to sell for $200, while the smaller one will go for $150.\n\nThey\u2019re definitely still on the \u2018premium\u2019 side of the streaming wars, but the price may well be worth it. Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV is one of the under-appreciated gems among Android devices. Where most Android devices are put out of commission within a year or two, Nvidia is one of the rare manufacturers that has continued to provide updates OS updates and new features to its device since the original launched way back in 2015. If the new device is anything like it, it\u2019ll serve potential buyers for years to come.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F01%2FNvidia-Shield-hed.jpg&signature=d1b399e603795d8100b71b21ea6d1946", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
