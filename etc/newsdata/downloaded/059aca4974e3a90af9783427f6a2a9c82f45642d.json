It's not the Bloc that will give you more money in your pocket. Quebecers can only count on us,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who the leader is. The Bloc will always be powerless spectators.\"\n\nHis speech, given last week at a rally in Laval, Que., could be a sign of things to come as political parties jostle for Quebec's 78 ridings. Some races are shaping up to be tight, with Liberal, Conservative, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and NDP candidates all in play.\n\nScheer's road to government doesn't necessarily run through Quebec, but a source within his party says the Conservatives are targeting strategic seats in the province, believing that they can capitalize on success the party has enjoyed in and around Quebec City.\n\nWhile the election has not been called yet, early pre-campaigning indicates the party is looking to attract sovereigntist voters who might otherwise vote Bloc.\n\nQuebec Conservative signs show a Quebec flag flying in the background. (Kate McKenna/CBC)\n\nLawn signs specifically prepared for Quebec feature a picture of the candidate \u2014 and a background that includes the Quebec flag.\n\nOutside of Quebec, candidate signs don't have any flag at all. In 2015, Conservative Quebec lawn signs featured both the Quebec flag and the Canadian flag.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois currently holds 10 seats in Quebec. The Conservative party holds 11, mostly in the Quebec City region.\n\nConservative campaign signs outside of Quebec do not show provincial flags. (Twitter/PierrePoilievre)\n\nQuebec messaging the same, but also different\n\nA party source says the Conservatives will not simply be translating their material from English to French \u2014 there will be Quebec-centric messaging for the province in this campaign.\n\nDespite that, they are adamant that they will not say something in French that they wouldn't say in English.\n\nThere are Quebec-specific issues. The party has already announced it will campaign for a single tax return in Quebec. The environment will also be more front-and-centre in campaign material.\n\nGerard Deltell, one of Quebec's Conservative MPs, says they're more than ready to run in Quebec.\n\n\"We have never been in a better position than we are now,\" said Deltell.\n\nHe credits the province's \"lieutenant,\" Victoriaville-area MP Alain Rayes, for recruiting strong candidates.\n\nThe Conservatives are also the only party to have a full slate of Quebec candidates one week before the election officially begins.\n\nConservative Quebec lieutenant Alain Rayes is being credited with finding strong candidates. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nIn Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, they've recruited former mayor Yves L\u00e9vesque. Olympic medalist Sylvie Fr\u00e9chette is running in the lower Laurentian riding of Rivi\u00e8re-du-Nord.\n\nA party source says the Conservatives are aiming for seats in the Eastern Townships, the south shore of Quebec City and the central and eastern regions of the province.\n\nBut Deltell says he believes seats across Quebec are up for grabs.\n\n\"We have great candidates in each and every part of the province and we want to be very competitive in each and every part of the province,\" Deltell said.", "description": "The party hopes that strong local candidates and taking votes from the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois could help win more of Quebec's 78 seats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5274830.1567978930!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20190906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
