Eckhardt's comment drew laughs from the panel's audience.\n\nThe comment was first reported in a tweet by The Federalist political editor John Daniel Davidson.\n\n\u201cIn my panel today at the Texas Tribune Festival on 'Public Enragement' I spoke about the importance of being able to disagree without being disagreeable. Then I said something disagreeable,\" Eckhardt said in a statement, according to The Texas Tribune. \u201cI want to apologize to Governor Abbott. I made a flippant comment that was inappropriate. The comment did nothing to further the debate I was participating in, much less further the political discourse in our community, state, and nation. While the Governor and I disagree on a number of issues, that is no excuse to be disagreeable.\"\n\nAbbott, 61, was left paralyzed from the waist down since 1984 when an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging in Houston. He has used a wheelchair ever since.\n\nTravis County Republican Party chairman Matt Mackowiak said Eckhardt\u2019s remark showed a \u201cprofound lack of compassion\u201d towards someone with a disability.\n\nTEXAS GOV APPROVES BUDGET WITH GUN SAFETY STORAGE EFFORT OPPOSED BY NRA\n\n\u201cJudge Eckhardt apparently believes that his disability is open to ridicule if it helps her make a political argument. This joke represents a profound lack of compassion from Judge Eckhardt,\u201d he said in a statement. \"There is no place for insulting Americans with disabilities and Judge Eckhardt should know better.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s office could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter his injury, Abbott sued the homeowner whose tree fell on him, along with the tree service company that had inspected the tree before it fell on him. Abbott received a multi-million dollar settlement in 1986, which he has said he would gladly give back to regain the use of his legs.\n\n\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t heal anything. Money doesn\u2019t allow me to walk. It doesn\u2019t allow me to dance with my wife. It doesn\u2019t allow me to pick up my daughter. It doesn\u2019t allow me to walk my daughter down the aisle when she gets married,\u201d Abbott told The Texas Tribune in 2013, during his first campaign for governor. \u201cIf you could name the person I could write the check to, I\u2019d send all this money right back if I could walk again.\"", "description": "A Democratic judge in Texas apologized Friday for saying the state's\u00a0governor,\u00a0Greg Abbott, \u2018hates trees because one fell on him,\u2019 a reference to an accident 35 years ago which left Abbott paralyzed.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/EckhardtAbbott720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
