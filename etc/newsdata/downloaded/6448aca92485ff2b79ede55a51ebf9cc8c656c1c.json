Her old interviews are displays of either surprising candour or frosty reserve. She can be earnest and thoughtful, sometimes to the point of seeming grave, yet she peppers her social media with \u201cpenis/yoni of the day\u201d posts, pictures of things that happen to look like genitals, even when they are not. She speaks with an American accent when with Americans, and with a crisp British accent with Brits, though she retains a US sheen on only one word that I clocked: \u201cprocess\u201d. She is extremely famous and has been for more than half her life, yet has maintained a sense of mystery and intrigue, and is keenly private.\n\nNaturally, then, in a photographic studio in a tiny back street in north London, talk has turned to tattoos of Anderson\u2019s face on strangers\u2019 buttocks. It started with one of her own cashmere jumpers, part of her new capsule collection for the London brand Winser (she turned designer for them in 2018, adding another string to an already creaking bow that includes activist and author, as well as actor) that features a familiar-looking mouth emblazoned across the chest, accented by that Monroe-esque beauty spot.\n\n\u201cIt is a strange thing, yes,\u201d she agrees, adding that of all the pieces, she probably won\u2019t make a habit of wearing the one with her own face on it. It\u2019s an impish design, but this being Anderson, there\u2019s more to it than a bit of self-reflective fun: some of its profits will go to Women for Women, which helps support female survivors of conflict.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The silly side of me has always been there\u2019: Gillian Anderson wears dress by Prada. Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer\n\n\u201cWell, the way that started was, a fan showed up with a T-shirt that she had made with my mouth on it. Which I recognised, and I went, \u2018Wait, is that\u2026?\u2019\u201d That might be an unnerving experience for most people, but Anderson has to admit that for her, it is not so out of the ordinary. \u201cI\u2019m kind of used to it,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cEspecially because of my old job. The enthusiasm of the fans, from being in something that\u2019s remotely science fiction, is more intense. And so I\u2019m used to tattoos on calves and buttocks and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, The X Files arrived on television, with Anderson at the helm as the sceptical FBI agent Dana Scully. She had just turned 25, and she found herself at the frenzied frontier of a cultural phenomenon. The tattoos soon followed.\n\n\u201cIt was really early on, actually. I had gone to Australia to do press, and somebody had David Duchovny and me on their buttocks, and were offering to show us.\u201d She laughs. The thought of what they might look like now tickles her. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are both less\u2026 chubby-cheeked?\u201d\n\nAnderson has been wrangling with what is public and private for the past three decades. Recently, she has found herself having to think about it again. The X Files came back in 2016, after 14 years away, and now there is Sex Education, the Netflix teen comedy-drama in which she plays a sex therapist. \u201cThis has gone to a completely different level,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in something that is so universally watched as this is. Even when I did The Fall, it was popular, but it wasn\u2019t Netflix popular, you know? So the level of recognition has gone up to what it was when I was younger.\u201d The trouble is that she forgets. \u201cI\u2019m so used to sliding under the radar that there have been some situations recently where it\u2019s just been\u2026 a lot. Travelling with kids and stuff. You don\u2019t want to be that person. You want to be like, ah, thanks!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The enthusiasm of fans, from being in science fiction, is intense\u2019: in the X-Files, which aired from 1993 when she was 25. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/20 Century Fox\n\nShe has three children; two boys, Oscar and Felix, aged 10 and 12, while her daughter, Piper, is 24. At the height of X Files mania, when Piper was young, Anderson was followed constantly by paparazzi. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my daughter to the park without long lenses and stuff. If that were the case here, I would not live here. I cannot stand it,\u201d she says, crisply.\n\nShe was born in the US, but spent her early childhood in north London, before moving back to the States when she was 11. She speaks fondly of London, of its green spaces and its vibrancy, and it is where she has lived for most of her adult life. \u201cIn my formative years, my experience of private life was quite public. And I had a very different experience here in the UK, if one knows what neighbourhoods to stay out of and what restaurants to stay away from. And also, it\u2019s just always felt like this is where I belong.\u201d She is superstitious enough to curse herself for what she is about to say, but here, she explains, she doesn\u2019t have photographers on her doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s that part of it that has made me really hate the business that I\u2019m in, at times.\u201d\n\nWhen she is working, Anderson says, she can be quite unpredictable. \u201cDepending on the day and what I\u2019m working on, and my need to focus or whatever, I can be very relaxed and jovial, and then sometimes I can be serious and slightly shut down. I\u2019m sure that must be confusing for people.\u201d I tell her I wasn\u2019t quite sure, from reading old interviews, who I was going to meet. She says that if she were to read an old interview with herself, which she doesn\u2019t, she could tell you which ones happened during periods of intense paparazzi interest, based on how frosty she was. \u201cIt makes you paranoid. I just completely clam up.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I had a very different experience here in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s always felt like this is where I belong\u2019: wearing her own Gillian Anderson for Winser London roll neck. Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer\n\nToday, she is perfectly open and friendly. Women, particularly, do seem to like her. \u201cI do feel like a woman\u2019s woman, and I go out of my way to be one. And actually I get so shocked and shaken when I come across women who aren\u2019t. It really unsettles me.\u201d\n\nAnderson has played so many iconic characters, and almost all of them have shared a solitary, mournful quality, from Miss Havisham to Stella Gibson, from Lady Dedlock to Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, who is not always played as a model of restraint. Sex Education, though, has given her the chance to be funny. Her character Jean is a nightmarishly frank parent, for whom oversharing does not exist, and Anderson has run with it. Her Twitter bio is still Shag Specialist. \u201cOh, is it?\u201d she says, coyly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m still the shag specialist. At least until Sex Education is off the air.\u201d Her social media has certainly taken on a fruitier twist. \u201cMostly, that\u2019s the penis and yoni of the day,\u201d she says. People send in images of accidental genitalia, and her team backlogs them, and posts them. \u201cIt\u2019s important!\u201d she laughs. It also shows off her sillier side. \u201cI mean, I feel like the silly side of me has always been there. Just in terms of the kind of humour. For a long time, Chewbacca was my boyfriend. I don\u2019t know if you know that, but we were dating for a long time.\u201d\n\nShe says this so matter-of-factly that it almost passes me by. Hold on, I say. Chewbacca? \u201cI can\u2019t remember whether it predates me taking a picture at a comic-con with the real Chewbacca. That might have been the beginning or it might have just been our first outing.\u201d Either way, it turns out, she enjoyed a longstanding digital relationship with the Star Wars stalwart, which led to fans sending her a wild selection of Chewbacca memorabilia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I guess I\u2019m still the shag specialist\u2019: as the no-boundaries therapist in Netflix\u2019s Sex Education. Photograph: Sam Taylor/Netflix\n\n\u201cThen, when I knew that I had started to date somebody in real life, I had announced at some point that Chewbacca and I had broken up.\u201d That was quite the declaration of commitment, to leave Chewbacca for your boyfriend. \u201cOh no, no, no. Let\u2019s be clear. They didn\u2019t overlap.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 no overlap \u2013 is Peter Morgan, the screenwriter and playwright who is currently at the helm of The Crown. Anderson is about to start work on the fourth season, in which she\u2019ll play Margaret Thatcher; she is both keen to talk about it and wary of letting anything slip. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite figured out how to talk about her yet.\u201d She has immersed herself in reading and watching everything she can find. \u201cTo a certain degree, it\u2019s very helpful for an actor, at least in my experience, to slightly fall in love with the character you\u2019re playing, regardless of what your opinion might be of them, if it\u2019s a historical character, particularly. So I have.\u201d\n\nShe is finding Thatcher \u201cabsolutely fascinating. Mostly because of her childhood. You could draw such a clear line from how she was raised and what she was exposed to in their religion, and how she was raised in the shop, and how she worked, and their work ethic and their beliefs. Just everything that came later stems so entirely from her childhood. But that in and of itself is fascinating, and \u2013 I\u2019m not going to use the word forgivable, but one can find compassion.\u201d She is excited to work with Olivia Colman, who will be her Queen, for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the third season, and she\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I like to think I am a women\u2019s woman\u2019: Gillian Anderson for Winser London silk georgette blouse; stretch wool trousers by Stella McCartney; shoes by Rupert Sanderson and earrings by Alighitheri. Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer\n\nIn February, she appeared in London\u2019s West End as Margo Channing, the role made famous by Bette Davis, in Ivo van Hove\u2019s stage adaptation of All About Eve. It is the story of a famous woman facing the horrors of age in an industry that is not sympathetic to it, and I wonder if Anderson felt any significance in playing her when she herself was 50. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cIn the film, Margo had just turned 40. The point wasn\u2019t that I as an actress was trying to do something younger. In fact, we raised the ages of everyone by 10 years.\u201d Her eyes flash, and she suddenly gives the impression of a cat teasing its prey. \u201cIs there another part to that question?\u201d she purrs.\n\nWell, some of the reviews had an issue with the idea of you as an ageing actress at all; you weren\u2019t \u201cageing\u201d enough to be worried about ageing. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really the point,\u201d she says, with a sigh. \u201cFirstly, so many of our issues about ageing, as men and women, have absolutely nothing to do with reality. It\u2019s so much to do with our own perception or what we think other people\u2019s perception is, to the point that 20-year-olds are having plastic surgery and Botox, because they believe that if there\u2019s some sign of a wrinkle, or if they\u2019re flat-chested or whatever, that that\u2019s bad. So for a 50-year-old woman to be concerned about it makes sense, especially given that that\u2019s her career.\u201d\n\nShe is on a roll; she loves talking about her characters. \u201cBut also it wasn\u2019t just about that. It was about her value, her value in her work, her value to her husband, not her value to her public, necessarily. So I was shocked at the small-mindedness of some of the reactions to it, in terms of just not understanding the psychology of human beings, and where lies fear, and one\u2019s currency in one\u2019s personal life and in one\u2019s work life.\u201d She takes a big breath, smiling. \u201cAnyway!\u201d\n\nIt will be a while before we see her on stage again. She likes to break up theatre roles, leaving gaps of a few years in between them. \u201cI\u2019ve had such fear and anxiety around it, and there have been so many times when I\u2019ve been in the middle of it thinking, I must be mad to be doing it again.\u201d\n\nBlanche DuBois, in particular, was tough. \u201cStreetcar was something else entirely. Even in the short runs that we did here and in the US, it really takes it out of one. I mean, there was a point where I thought I might be losing touch with reality, which is known to happen during that play.\u201d Has she thought about doing a comedy? \u201cWell, Sex Education is a gift in that way. There\u2019s funny stuff in this second season.\u201d\n\nDuring Sex Education\u2019s first run, Anderson\u2019s hair was icy white. Today, it\u2019s a light strawberry blonde again. She went white initially just to try it, for herself, and it seemed to fit Jean\u2019s character, so she kept it. \u201cBut then my hair started to fall out.\u201d She lifts up her hair to show me her roots. Her natural colour is a mousey brown, with only the odd grey strand, though she has thought about going grey. \u201cOh, I would, yes, and I\u2019ve thought about it quite a lot, actually, when I had that hair. I absolutely would. It\u2019s occurred to me that to decide to have it natural, as an actor, is quite a big decision. But it\u2019s interesting, because when I first did it, I thought, it\u2019s kind of cool, in an Annie Lennox, Billy Idol-ey kind of way.\u201d\n\nFor a second, Anderson offers a glimpse of the teenage punk she was. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in your 50s, it just looks like you\u2019ve got grey hair. So I look forward to that, but I\u2019m not ready yet, to deal with the consequences of it, which would be, presumably, that I would naturally be cast in a different zone of characters.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m a bit of a hermit\u2019: in A Streetcar Named Desire. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nWe meet a few days before her 51st birthday. She celebrated the big day last summer with three small parties, in London, in Canada and in the US. \u201cBut it was only five people, six, and 13,\u201d she says, merrily. \u201cThose are all the friends I have.\u201d She likes to be alone, and is a happily solitary person; the idea of a big party felt both presumptuous and like it was inviting \u201ctoo much attention. It\u2019s possible that were everyone in town, I would have chosen to do something with 30 people, but I don\u2019t have hundreds of people in my life. I don\u2019t have 300 people to invite. I mean, I probably do, but I wouldn\u2019t imagine inviting people to fly over from LA.\u201d She looks horrified at the prospect. \u201cIt felt better to gather in small groups.\u201d\n\nThat suits her personality, anyway. \u201cI think because I was an only child for so long, I don\u2019t like to share,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI have spent a lot of my life being a bit of a loner and a bit of a hermit, and that\u2019s my preferred state of being.\u201d\n\nShe has chosen a funny career for someone who needs a lot of alone time. \u201cYeah, but when I\u2019m not doing this, I don\u2019t leave the house,\u201d she beams. \u201cIt\u2019s true! I really don\u2019t. I work, or I\u2019m with my kids. When I\u2019m with my kids, I take them out. But I\u2019m likely to sit in the corner.\u201d\n\nStyling by Hope Lawrie; lighting by Joe Stone; production by Emma Allan at Lemonade Productions; Waddington Studios; hair by Nick Irwin for anticollective.com; assisted by Ellie Bond; makeup by Florrie White at Bryant Artists using Surratt Beauty\n\nGillian Anderson\u2019s new collection for Winser London launches today on winserlondon.com", "description": "She\u2019s played a host of strong female leads, from Miss Havisham to Blanche DuBois \u2013 and now Margaret Thatcher.
