This is partly why President Trump ultimately withdrew from this deeply flawed agreement.\n\nIn fact, the nuclear deal aided Iranian military aggression and support of terrorist groups by lifting international economic sanctions against Iran and freeing up Iranian funds frozen by foreign banks. Iran has supported several terrorist groups in the region, including Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah based in Lebanon, the Palestinian group Hamas that rules the Gaza Strip, and the brutal regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.\n\nTRUMP: US 'LOCKED AND LOADED' AGAINST ATTACKERS OF SAUDI OIL FACILITY 'DEPENDING ON VERIFICATION'\n\nThe attack Saturday on Saudi oil facilities \u2013 which temporarily cut Saudi oil production in half \u2013 was carried out by either drones or cruise missiles (or a combination of the two), according to news reports. About 5.7 million barrels of crude oil production were interrupted by the Saturday attack, amounting to more than 5 percent of the world\u2019s daily oil supply.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet Saturday that \u201cTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia \u2026 Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\nAnd President Trump tweeted Sunday night: \u201cSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nThe president notably refrained from saying who the U.S. government believes is responsible for the attack on Saudi Arabia, but U.S. officials previously pointed to Iran.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is playing a game of three-dimensional chess against the U.S. and its regional partners \u2013 a game aiming to induce weakness and irresolution in the face of the Iranian challenge.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels are claiming credit for the strike against the Saudi oil facilities. However, satellite photos released by the U.S. government showed at least \u201c17 points of impact\u201d that officials said indicated the attack came from the direction of Iran or Iraq rather than the Houthi\u2019s home base of Yemen.\n\nIranian officials denied their government was responsible for the strikes against Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn late 2014, the Houthis burst forth from their stronghold in northern Yemen, conquered the capital city of Sanaa, and plunged the Arab world\u2019s poorest country into deep chaos. Since then, humanitarian suffering caused by the Houthi insurgency has mushroomed across the nation on a medieval scale.\n\nSince 2015, Saudi Arabia has led a multinational military coalition to restore the U.N.-backed government in Yemen. The Saudis prosecution of the war has made their nation the primary target of international criticism \u2013 even as Saudi bases, cities, airports and oil installations come under attack from Houthi rockets, missiles and drones.\n\nOther foreign belligerents have mostly escaped blame.\n\nIran\u2019s involvement in Yemen is more nefarious. Tehran seeks to co-opt the Houthi insurgency into a tool with which to bleed and bludgeon its regional rival, Saudi Arabia. This competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a struggle for both the sacred and profane: for leadership of the Muslim world, for individual Muslim hearts and minds, for the Middle East regional balance, and for oil.\n\nIran has provided the Houthis with anti-tank missiles, ballistic missiles of varying ranges, cruise missiles, and suicide drones \u2013 which can function as cruise missiles. As a result, Iran has been able to grow the long-arm of Houthi military capabilities, and at a low cost to Iran.\n\nIranian-supplied weapons allow the Houthi insurgents to strike at the Saudi heartland from a distance and respond to battlefield developments at a time and place of their own choosing.\n\nIn additions to the tweets from Pompeo and Trump,\n\nThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.elsewhere on Twitter, there has been increased chatter about, and even video alleging, that the strikes on Saudi Arabia originated in Iraq. If that were the case, Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq, which are part of Tehran\u2019s broad proxy network across the Middle East, would be to blame rather than the Houthis.\n\nShould the thesis of Iraqi involvement hold, it would be a measure of the Houthis\u2019 deference to Iran that they claimed credit for an attack they did not carry out.\n\nIt would also be an indicator of Tehran\u2019s tolerance for risk and retaliation in places like Yemen \u2013 which is far away, unlike Iraq, which is right next door to Iran.\n\nConversely, should Iran have launched cruise missiles from its own territory \u2013 which is less likely \u2013 it would mean Tehran is confident that its adversaries would not respond using military force against the origin of the strikes.\n\nWhile Iran is known as a ballistic missile powerhouse in the region, copies of its cruise missiles are increasingly winding up in the hands of terrorist groups, be they anti-ship variants with Hezbollah in Lebanon or land-attack cruise missiles with the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nEither way, the launching of cruise missiles and/or drones at a vital artery of the international economy conveys a broader strategic point: Iran\u2019s threats to oil shipping are not limited to the Strait of Hormuz, where over one-fifth of seaborne traded oil passes daily. This signifies that the regime is comfortable broadening the scope of its harassment from oil tankers at sea to oil installations on land. Consider this an attempt to make good on old threats.\n\nWith the blaze of Saudi oil facilities in hindsight, the priority for Washington should not be to covet a high-level meeting with the Islamic Republic on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City in coming days. It must be how better to contest Iran\u2019s asymmetric military capabilities, as well as those of its proxies and partners in the region.\n\nSince May, Washington has been hardening and growing its military footprint in the region through enhanced deployments. This process, as well as tough sanctions, should continue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSlowing economic pressure, recalling assets \u2013 or worse, talking to Tehran only about the nuclear issue \u2013 would replicate the mistakes that got the U.S. into the flawed 2015 nuclear deal, which in turn underwrote the expansion of Iran\u2019s regional threat network.\n\nThe Trump administration should not make the same mistake as the Obama administration, and should instead continue to hold Iran accountable for its latest hostile actions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BEHNAM BEN TALEBLU", "description": "The devastating attack Saturday against a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia dramatically illustrates why the Iran nuclear deal that was accepted by the Obama administration and rejected by President Trump failed to end the Iranian threat to peace and stability in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Behnam Ben Taleblu", "Behnam Ben Taleblu Is A Senior Iran Analyst At The Foundation For Defense Of Democracies", "A Nonpartisan Research Institute Focusing On National Security", "Foreign Policy.
