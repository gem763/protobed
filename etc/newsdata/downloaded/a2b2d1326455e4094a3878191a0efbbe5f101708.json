USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Wizards' Capital One Arena sits in the heart of the city\u2019s Chinatown, which served as a unique backdrop to the chasm between the NBA and China over Houston Rockers general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet, which infuriated China.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wizards played the Chinese Basketball Association\u2019s Guangzhou Loong Lions in a preseason game.\n\nOutside the arena about an hour before the game, pro-Hong Kong supporters from the non-profit Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation handed out \"Free Hong Kong\" t-shirts, hoping fans would wear them inside the arena.\n\nIt was a sparse crowd at the game \u2014 no more than a few thousand fans \u2014 but some fans wore the t-shirts.\n\nPro-Hong Kong supporters out the Wizards arena, where China\u2019s Loong Lions are in town for a preseason game. They\u2019re handing out shirts hoping fans where them inside the arena, which is in the heart of D.C.\u2019s Chinatown. pic.twitter.com/04VqnrN5a5 \u2014 Jeff Zillgitt (@JeffZillgitt) October 9, 2019\n\nOne fan at the end of the Chinese national anthem yelled \"Free Hong Kong\" and then left the arena on his own. He was not escorted out, according to Wizards spokesperson Scott Hall. Jon Schweppe, who was wearing a pro-Hong Kong shirt, confirmed this account.\n\nA few other fans had \"Free Hong Kong\" signs, and Schweppe, wearing one of those t-shirts, held a sign that read \"Google Uyghurs,\" a reference to Muslims who are under mass internment in China.\n\nAt the end of the Chinese national anthem and during the silence before the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, a protestor screams \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d while holding a sign. He walks out of the arena peacefully, followed by an usher. pic.twitter.com/H9JrZHb9FO \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 9, 2019\n\nThose signs were removed by arena staffers because Capital One Arena has a policy that says signs, banners and posters \"may not be commercial or political in nature.\" Lions players were not made available to reporters after the game.\n\nBut those in support of Hong Kong were able to make their point.\n\n\"We clearly understand Chinese influence on major American industries or corporations or people,\" Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation executive director Marion Smith told USA TODAY Sports. \"But at the same time, we think it\u2019s the long-term and medium-term interest of America and the NBA for us to resist all efforts of the Chinese communist party to use a sport to advance propaganda.\"\n\nWhile Smith understands the NBA side of this issue may not last long, Smith noted his organization, which has been around since 1992, is in this for the long haul.\n\nCLOSE NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league wasn't apologizing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. (Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\n\"We are interested in business, sports and entertainment leaders understanding that we need companies that enjoy American free speech, rule of law and free enterprise and to stand for those values,\" Smith said. \"Increasingly, companies and public figures are going to have to make a choice here.\"\n\nAfter a slow start to its defense of Morey, the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver made clear their support for free speech, even if it cuts into the NBA's revenue from China.\n\nSmith shot down the idea that it\u2019s a difficult decision for companies to walk away from the amount of money that can be made from China.\n\n\"You can turn a buck, people do it all over the world. But there\u2019s business and then there\u2019s business,\" he said. \"When it comes to free enterprise \u2014 a system that respects the dignity of work and human rights of the individual \u2014 that\u2019s what we stand for.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "Supporters from the non-profit Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation handed out \"Free Hong Kong\" t-shirts at Capital One Arena in DC's Chinatown.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
