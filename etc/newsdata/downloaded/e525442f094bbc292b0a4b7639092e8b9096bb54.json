Some rejected Ms Lam's move and vowed to keep on protesting.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Ms Lam also announced other measures that appeared to be designed to soothe unrest.\n\nShe said two senior officials would join an existing inquiry into police conduct during the protests. An independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters is another of the activists' key demands.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Lam was heard on leaked audio tapes blaming herself for igniting Hong Kong's political crisis, and saying it was unforgiveable of her to have caused such huge havoc.\n\nThe extradition bill quickly drew criticism after being unveiled in April. Opponents said it would undermine Hong Kong's legal freedoms and might be used to intimidate or silence critics of Beijing.\n\nHong Kong is now in its 14th successive week of demonstrations, and saw fresh violence between police and activists last weekend.\n\nWhat did Carrie Lam say?\n\nIn her pre-recorded message Ms Lam said the government would \"formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns\".\n\nShe said the protests had \"shocked and saddened the Hong Kong people\" and the violence was \"pushing Hong Kong towards a highly dangerous situation\".\n\n\"No matter what discontentment the people have towards the government or the society, violence is not the way to resolve problems,\" she said.\n\n\"Currently, stopping the violence is the top priority, maintaining the law and rebuilding the rules of society. The government will sternly tackle violence and illegal action.\"\n\nMs Lam said she and other senior officials would visit communities in Hong Kong and talk to people directly about their concerns.\n\nWhat reaction has there been?\n\nPro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip told BBC Chinese the latest move was \"a positive step forward\".\n\n\"It won't pacify everybody but hopefully it would clear remaining doubt in the minds of some of the peaceful protesters,\" she said.\n\n\"The protests have been driven by a multitude of reasons including deep-rooted anger about Hong Kong's widening wealth gap, housing conditions and political system. I am glad that the chief executive said that she would go to the district to enter direct dialogue with the people from all walks of life.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Students have boycotted classes as protests continue into their 14th week\n\nPro-democracy politician Wu Chi-Wai, however, dismissed Carrie Lam's compromises as \"fake\".\n\n\"We must stop police brutality. Otherwise the protests will keep going,\" he said.\n\nAhead of Ms Lam's announcement, leading pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said the withdrawal of the bill would be \"too little too late\".\n\nIn a series of tweets he said all the protesters' demands had to be met.\n\nFellow pro-democracy activist Nathan Law told the BBC that their campaign would go on.\n\n\"The movement has evolved into a movement that fights for autonomy, democracy and also preserving our way of life and restricting the excessive power of the police. So I think the protest will continue based on that,\" he said.\n\nAmnesty International said that although the withdrawal of the bill was welcome, an independent investigation into \"unnecessary and excessive use of force by police\" was needed \"more than ever\".\n\nDemonstrators want amnesty for all those arrested, greater political reforms and for officials to stop describing the protests as riots.\n\nHong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. It has remained semi-autonomous under a \"one country, two systems\" principle but some fear China is seeking greater control.\n\nWill concessions be enough to stop protests?\n\nAnalysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong\n\nBy her own reckoning, Hong Kong's chief executive has created \"unforgivable havoc\" by bungling the response to broad public opposition to her proposal.\n\nFinally, she is officially withdrawing the bill.\n\nThere had been widespread speculation that Carrie Lam did not have the authority to adhere to this or any of the protesters' demands because Beijing has really been calling the shots.\n\nIt is possible that she has been given the green light to pull the bill to try to show that Hong Kong's autonomous decision-making is still intact.\n\nBut the longer it has taken for the extradition bill debate to be resolved, the wider the demands from activists have become. Many demonstrators now say they will not stop holding rallies without a genuinely independent inquiry into the Hong Kong police force and universal suffrage in this region.\n\nWhat is the bill about?\n\nOpponents said allowing criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China would undermine the city's judicial independence and risked exposing Hong Kongers to unfair trials and violent treatment.\n\nThey also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.\n\nOpposition was widespread from the start with groups from all sections of society voicing their criticism.\n\nSeveral countries also expressed concern. In response, China's foreign ministry accused them of interference in China's internal affairs.\n\nA guide to the Hong Kong protests", "description": "Fully withdrawing the controversial bill has been one of the key demands during months of protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mf4z6.jpg"}
