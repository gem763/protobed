Nearly 50,000 hourly workers have been striking since September 16 in a walkout that has halted production at 31 factories and led to thousands of layoffs at auto supply companies.\n\nMarick Masters, a professor at Wayne State University who specializes in labor negotiations, said GM's latest move and the UAW's forceful response suggest the strike is likely to go on at least \"somewhat longer\" even though the negotiations had made some progress in narrowing the differences between the two sides.\n\n\"The pain is beginning to set in on both sides and they'll realize that sooner or later,\" Masters said in an interview. \"They'll have to come to terms with reality and strike an accord.\"\n\nMasters said concerns about job security are at the center of the UAW's stance in light of GM's emphasis on building electric cars and developing autonomous technology as its future strategy.\n\nThe talks center on \"how much of a commitment is GM willing to make to produce combustion-engine automobiles in the US for the foreseeable future,\" said Masters.", "description": "General Motors went public Friday with highlights of its latest contract proposal, prompting a sharp response from union leaders as a grinding strike moved...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/wire-19604214-1570821765-976_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
