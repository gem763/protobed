Res. 604. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for reading a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump into the record.\n\nSchiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nBiggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week, but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.\n\nThe legislation has quickly gained support from Republicans across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House GOP leadership have all backed the legislation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.\n\nAs the House moves towards voting on Biggs\u2019 bill to condemn Schiff, not every Republican has cosponsored the bill. The 23 Republicans that have yet to cosponsor the bill to condemn Schiff are:\n\nMartha Roby (R-AL) Ken Buck (R-CO) Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) Francis Rooney (R-FL) Rob Woodall (R-GA) Rodney Davis (R-IL) Jackie Walorski (R-IL) Greg Pence (R-IL) Hal Rogers (R-IL) Fred Upton (R-MI) Ann Wagner (R-MO) Chris Smith (R-NJ) Peter King (R-NY) Tom Reed (R-NY) John Katko (R-NY) Mike Turner (R-OH) Greg Walden (R-OR) Dusty Johnson (R-SD) Van Taylor (R-TX) Michael McCaul (R-TX) Mac Thornberry (R-TX) Jamie-Herrera Beutler (R-WA) Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)\n\nReaders should note that even though these Republicans have not cosponsored the legislation, it does not necessarily mean that they will vote against the resolution to condemn Schiff. It remains entirely possible that many, if not all, of these Republicans will vote for the resolution to condemn Schiff.\n\nHowever, since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Schiff have moved forward with their impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, this resolution has become a focal point through which Republicans can fight back against the Democrats and show Republicans\u2019 nearly unanimous support for Trump.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted in support of Biggs\u2019 bill to censure Schiff Saturday.\n\nTrump wrote, \u201cThere has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt. Go Andy!\u201d\n\nThere has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt. Go Andy! https://t.co/yw57NhKpG2 \u2014 Donald J.
