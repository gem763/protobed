Michael Bunn\n\nHobart Airport has also been a beneficiary of strong traffic growth in recent years with both Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia putting on additional routes to capitalise on growing tourism interest in Tasmania.\n\nIt comes after a hotly contested auction that came to a head last week when Credit Suisse collected bids for MIRA's 50.1 per cent stake.", "description": "Australian infrastructure investor QIC Ltd and Dutch partner Schiphol have agreed a deal to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Hobart Airport, sources told Street Talk on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3203%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce60d1a896d20b67ec57cafe4b8413b84bfb09b7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
