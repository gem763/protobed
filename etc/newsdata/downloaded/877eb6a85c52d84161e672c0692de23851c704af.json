a 200-kilometre (124-mile) band around Japanese territory.\n\nA submarine-based missile would take the North's arsenal to a new level, allowing deployment far beyond the Korean peninsula and a second-strike capability in the event of an attack on its military bases (pictured: an image released by the North's propaganda machine Wednesday)\n\n'The launching of ballistic missiles violates UN Security Council resolutions and we strongly protest and strongly condemn it,' Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry condemned repeated missile launches by Pyongyang and said the latest test 'cannot contribute to the resumption of serious negotiations.'\n\nThe North's leader Kim Jong Un sent 'warm congratulations' to research units involved in the launch, which 'had no adverse impact on the security of neighboring countries,' KCNA said.\n\nNorth Korea is banned from ballistic missile launches by United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\nHowever, it rejects those resolutions, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defence.\n\nThe test-firing 'ushered in a new phase in containing the outside forces' threat to the DPRK and further bolstering its military muscle for self-defence,' KCNA said, using a formal acronym for the North.\n\nThe North carried out a successful test of the solid-fuel Pukkuksong-1, also known as KN-11, in August 2016, which flew around 301 miles (500 kilometres).\n\nIn July, North Korean state media had published pictures of Kim Jong Un inspecting a new type of submarine, fuelling concerns that Pyongyang was pushing ahead with an SLBM programme.\n\nAnalysts say the missile is likely an intermediate-range ballistic missile with an actual flight range of around 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometres).\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drew a line between a recent series of launches by Pyongyang and Wednesday's test, calling it 'an explicitly nuclear weapons system'.\n\nThe launch came a day after the North's Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Pyongyang had agreed to hold working-level talks with Washington later this week.\n\nDonald Trump crosses the border with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on 30 June 2019 - Washington has urged Pyongyang to stop its provocative tests and come to the table\n\nThe two sides will have 'preliminary contact' on Friday and hold negotiations the following day, Choe said in a statement carried by KCNA.\n\nUS State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus later confirmed the talks, which she said would happen 'within the next week'.\n\nIt is not the first time the North has followed up an offer of talks with a weapons test.\n\nPyongyang tested what it called a 'super-large' rocket launcher last month just hours after Choe released a statement saying that the North was willing to resume working-level talks with Washington.\n\nNegotiations between the two have been deadlocked since a second summit between the North's leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in February ended without a deal.\n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi of China, North Korea's main ally, said that the United States needed to ease its pressure campaign on Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea is under heavy US and UN sanctions over its nuclear programme.", "description": "'The new-type ballistic missile was fired in vertical mode' on Wednesday in the waters off Wonsan Bay, the Korean Central News Agency reported.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/01/19232126-0-image-a-3_1570061982800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
