For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro are $199.98, which is $50 cheaper than usual, at Google Express (sold via Daily Steals) for the Labor Day holiday in the US. This sale marks the cheapest price they\u2019ve sold for yet, in case you\u2019ve had your eye on them.\n\nTo get in on this deal, you\u2019ll need to visit Google Express\u2019 page, add the Powerbeats Pro to your cart, then apply the code 19LABOR12 at checkout. They\u2019re currently listed at $227.25, but the code brings the total (before tax) down to $199.98.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro are currently our favorite truly wireless headphones. Like our runner-up pick, the second-generation AirPods, these Beats use Apple\u2019s H1 wireless chip for fast, easy switching between your iPhone, Apple Watch, and other Apple devices. It also allows for hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice commands.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro have an improved fit that should be compatible with more ear sizes than the AirPods, and they also have better sound performance and battery life. Even though the Beats don\u2019t support wireless charging and their case is \u201claughably large,\u201d according to our review, it doesn\u2019t take away from the value here.\n\nThis deal expires on August 31st or when the supply runs out.", "description": "If you\u2019ve been looking for a deal on the new Beats Powerbeats Pro, you\u2019re in luck: Google Express (via Daily Steals) is hosting the best deal we\u2019ve seen yet by marking them down by $50 with an offer code.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A12e8I926XFi2sjOujwLqQR4ArU=/0x80:2040x1148/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234648/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
