So, although our team\u2019s trained well, if they\u2019re turning round and serving, it\u2019s difficult for them to see exactly who\u2019s next. So, this technology, it\u2019s been helping them, be exact on who\u2019s at the bar and who\u2019s next in line to be served.\u201d\n\nIt might be good news for those who struggle to get served in busy bars, but privacy campaigners warn it \u2018trivialises a dangerous surveillance technology\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not solving a problem that desperately needs to be solved at all, there\u2019s no obvious need for it. And yet people just going to have a drink are going to be biometrically analysed, scanned, have their face up on a screen, it\u2019s just really quite intrusive stuff,\u2019 says Silkie Carlo, director of British civil liberties campaign organisation Big Brother Watch.\n\n\u2018And around the rest of the world, we\u2019re seeing that facial recognition is being used as quite an oppressive surveillance technology, so what we don\u2019t want to see is it sort of creeping into social life in the UK.\u2019\n\nWyllie says bar visitors shouldn\u2019t be worried about their privacy \u2013 data collected by the webcam isn\u2019t stored, snap-shot thumbnail images of faces are deleted at the end of each session.\n\nThe data doesn\u2019t leave the venue. It\u2019s processed internally by the AI device.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re being very transparent around how we\u2019re using your face for this purpose,\u201d says Wyllie.\n\n\u2018There are no hidden cameras, there\u2019s no data being stored in any permanent way.\n\n\u2018And so, we\u2019re really keen to understand what the public feel is appropriate and what level of consent and permission is required to allow us to do this.\u2019\n\nThe Underdog hopes to use the technology at peak times. But, due to GDPR standards, they must obtain explicit consent from everyone entering the venue in order to use the tech, so currently it is only used for special events when consent has been obtained.", "description": "Big Brother is finally getting his round in.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92263292_1572019281.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
