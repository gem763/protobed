If a flashlight is farther away from an object, the beam of light is wider and less intense. The closer the flashlight gets to an object, the more focused and bright the beam of light.\n\nA broadband beam from a satellite behaves similarly to a beam of light from a flashlight.

Current satellites orbit higher above the earth, meaning they cover wider geographical areas but have less data capacity and thus can only serve a limited number of subscribers. Newer, smaller satellites are designed to orbit closer to earth, resulting in more direct signals and more capacity with 5G-like speeds.\n\nabove the earth, meaning they cover wider geographical areas but have less data capacity and thus can only serve a limited number of subscribers. Newer, smaller satellites are designed to orbit closer to earth, resulting in more direct signals and more capacity with 5G-like speeds. But the closer the satellites are to earth, the narrower the signal beam. So providers need more satellites to cover a broad area. Even with more advanced launch strategies, deploying thousands of satellites is still a pricey proposition.\n\nThe FCC has tried to free up additional spectrum for satellite services and modify rules to allow new constellations of satellites to be launched.\n\nHere's what a few companies are doing:\n\nBottom line: Lower-Earth constellations have the potential to compete more directly with cable or fiber networks on speed and price than the older satellite systems. But these companies will require a large number of subscribers \u2014 on the order of tens of millions \u2014 to recoup their costs, per an OECD paper.\n\nGo deeper: Satellite TV\u2019s tricky future in the cord-cutting era", "description": "Low-Earth satellites have the potential to compete more directly with cable or fiber networks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/r9rJbQDBrE_Vt-vyQZhkr4H5BK4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/10/06/1538833598975.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-06"}
