'You could be cooking and open the oven door and no one can get past,' Helen said.\n\nThe back of the Victorian house wasn't very attractive, while the garden was over grown\n\nThe transformation - light poured in from the back of the house as they opened it up with large window doors which went out on to the garden\n\nNext to the kitchen was the families only bathroom, and their utility room - which was providing no use to them, and she described it as a bunker or dungeon - making you 'feel like you are underground'.\n\nAs always two architects Robert Jamison and Laura Jane Clark competed to take control of the renovation project. Showing them how they would look via VR teh couple were impressed.\n\nRobert used influences from Japanese architecture to draw light into the centre of the terraced home, while offering Helen the separation she wanted and also answering Rob\u2019s desire for open spaces.\n\nThe living area (right back) was blocked off completely and the new kitchen area was bought forward\n\nNext to the kitchen lies the families only bathroom, and their utility room (pictured) - which was providing no use to the them, and Helen described it as a bunker or dungeon -making you 'feel like you are underground'\n\nHowever Laura stripped out the back of the house completely - she moved the kitchen into the living area and the bathroom upstairs to create some room and open up the space - a solution that wowed both Helen and Rob.\n\nIt was a hard decision for the couple to make, as they loved both designs. Rob said: 'We liked Roberts vision of space, but loved Laura's design - so it took us a long time,\n\n'There was a lot of negotiating and conversation, but we went for Laura's design as over time we fell in love with it - the VR walk through was incredible to see what it would look like.'\n\n'Laura looked at the practicalities of the house as as well as the design and its achieved a feeling that I really wanted it to be - its open and light and spacious,' Helen said.\n\nThe new kitchen: Modern lighting had also been installed with funky plants and furniture\n\nTwitter agreed that the couple had made the right choice and loved the new design and the couple\n\nThe finished renovation was an adaptation of Laura's design, with white walls, instead of exposed brick wall, which made it look less homely.\n\nPresenter Angela Scanlon was wowed by the open design too - which also saw the utility room knocked down and only a toilet left, which opened up the whole back of the house.\n\nA modern kitchen had been installed, while light poured in from the back of the house and also from the ceiling. Modern lighting had also been installed with funky plants and furniture.\n\nWhile Twitter agreed that the couple had made the right choice. 'Laura's design won't date as much as Rob's and it will be attractive to buyers if you choose to sell. Rob's design will need to be totally ripped out by your average Victorian house purchaser and thus the value of the property will be depressed #yourhomemadeperfect'\n\nAnother agreed: 'I think my favourite transformation ever on #yourhomemadeperfect the doors, the floor, the black metal and the brass, what a treat. Rob and Helen have my dream house.'\n\nWhile another said: 'Laura's amazing design completely changed their house. What a lovely down to earth and practical couple, with great taste. Love their revamped house. Looking fwd to the next episode!'", "description": "Helen and Rob, from St Albans, appeared on BBC 2's Your Home Made Perfect and spent \u00a3100,000 converting the extension of their property into a modern warehouse style space.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/08/19527620-0-image-a-6_1570692705473.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
