He lived that way for eight years before realizing he had been a victim of childhood abuse and began the process of returning to his birth-assigned gender.\n\nIn an explosive interview with controversial conservative host Candace Owens, Heyer re-told the story of his troubled childhood; how his grandmother sparked gender confusion by encouraging him to wear a purple dress at the age of four \u2013 and how he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an uncle as a direct result.\n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT interview I\u2019ve ever done is out now!\n\n\n\nFormer Transgender woman Walt Heyer completely obliterates the \u201ctrans\u201d narrative & reveals the truth; children switching genders signifies child abuse from the adults that watch them.\n\n\n\nWatch HERE: https://t.co/MMMS1LNy4mpic.twitter.com/vmhmw6AQJi \u2014 Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cThe consequences of [grandma] affirming me became very destructive \u2013 I think it\u2019s actually evil and it\u2019s child abuse to indicate that you can change genders at such a young age, and I\u2019m speaking from 74 years of experience, so it\u2019s not like I just came to this conclusion,\u201d Heyer told Owens.\n\nToday they call it gender dysphoria, but \u201cit\u2019s really just child abuse,\u201d he said.\n\nIt confused my identity of who I was \u2013 the seed was planted and the destruction had started.\n\nHeyer believes that the idea of gender dysphoria is introduced to children by adults and that a person is \u201cnot born with it.\u201d To encourage it creates an abhorrent \u201cearly sexualization\u201d of the child, he said.\n\nHeyer now runs a website for those who regret transitioning and publishes books and articles on the subject. He believes there is a misconception that transgenderism has something to do with being gay, but claims that 95 percent of the people who he speaks to about wanting to detransition are not gay.\n\nAlso on rt.com Joy of self-identification or social contagion? Why did trans become the trend\n\nIn fact, he adds, a desire to transition is usually a \u201cbandaid\u201d for something else \u2013 often abuse \u2013 which makes the person not want to be who they are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to escape, and this is where the dissociation comes in. You don\u2019t want to be who you are, so you attempt to be someone else \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to be who you are because you got hurt, something happened to you,\u201d he said.\n\nOwens has repeatedly come under fire from the transgender community for expressing similar sentiments in her interviews, including questioning the readiness of modern parents to encourage curious children to transition. Actor Mario Lopez was recently condemned across social media for arguing during an interview with Owens that children as young as three years-old might be too young to decide their own gender.\n\nThe conservative host has also been slammed for suggesting that the medical community is too quick to diagnose a child as being \u201ctransgender\u201d when perhaps something else could be going on. But Heyer echoes those concerns about medical professionals.\n\nAlso on rt.com Parents outraged as girls \u2018too embarrassed to pee\u2019 in London primary school UNISEX TOILETS\n\nHe recounts his own personal experience of visiting a top gender therapist seeking help at the age of 41. Married with two children and a successful career, Heyer was still suffering mental anguish after years of being unable to talk about his past. After only two sessions, the therapist prescribed hormones and wanted him to approve reassignment surgery.\n\nDon\u2019t let them tell you that they go through some exhaustive psychological counseling because it\u2019s absolute baloney \u2013 they just approve, approve, approve, affirm, affirm, affirm \u2013 give them hormones, give them surgery. It\u2019s an assembly line.\n\nHeyer ultimately divorced his wife, underwent surgery and was fired from his job.\n\nThe comments sound provocative at a time when society teaches that the only acceptable response to a questioning or confused child is to immediately support their decision to live as another gender. He is not looked upon kindly among trans activists, who say that, while he may have been misdiagnosed as transgender while actually suffering from a \u201cdissociative disorder,\u201d that is not the case with all trans individuals.\n\nYet, Heyer is not alone in some of his conclusions. Others have warned of the dangers of pumping kids full of hormones and using surgery as a drastic quick-fix to a problem which may be more layered and complicated.\n\nAlso on rt.com Wait! US & UK doctors warn against hormones/surgery for trans-identified kids\n\nIn the UK, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) recently cautioned that there is a lack of \u201crobust evidence\u201d about the long-term impact of puberty-blocking drugs and hormones given to trans-identified kids. Whistleblower Dr. Kirsty Entwistle, who\u2019d previously worked at the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), has said \u201ctraumatic early experiences\u201d \u2013 including sexual abuse \u2013 can lead a child to present with gender dysphoria, but doctors are refusing to fully investigate these cases for fear of being labelled \u201ctransphobic.\u201d\n\nAddressing the high suicide rate among those who have completed the surgical transition, Heyer blames what he believes is the realization that they can \u201cnever\u201d really fully become another gender, which results in further depression.\n\nIt\u2019s insane to treat depression with hormones and surgery, but that\u2019s what they do.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
