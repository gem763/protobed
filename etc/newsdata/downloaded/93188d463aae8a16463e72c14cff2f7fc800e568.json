Eva pilgrim sat down with kobe to talk books, fatherhood. This was a fun conversation. Kobe Bryant is the dad to four, yes, I said four daughters. And he told me being a father to girls has definitely changed him. His daughters are his inspiration for his latest book. You know him best as NBA champion and two-time olympic gold medalist but kobe Bryant got creative after his 2016 retirement from basketball. Now out with his second novel, \"Legacy and the queen.\" This story about a young tennis prodigy who needs to summon magic to defeat the supernatural is close to Bryant's heart as a longtime athlete. You know, sports is a very emotional thing and our world that emotion is what creates the magic. Why did you decide to write this book about a girl playing Well, I have four girls at home and, you know, I wanted to make sure it's important that they see characters that look like them and that are also athletes and, you know, they get tired of hearing my voice of, be persist inter, work hard, you know, believe in yourself. Okay, dad, I got it. We get it. So when I can put them into stories like this, hopefully we'll get that same message without having their parents in their ear all the time. What is the lesson that you want little girls and little boys to take away when they read this book. The biggest thing for this book and all our books in the series is self-awareness. How to be aware of anxiety you may feel, the pressures, whether self-induced or coming from parents or coaches, you know, how to deal with failure, success. We tend to think for our children as content like that is a little too heavy or rich for them at this time and we disagree. We feel like it's important to have those conversations at an earlier age. Now you have a 16-year-old. Yeah, I got a 16-year-old, yeah. That's like dating age. I don't -- That's what they say. How is kobe the dad with the guys coming to the door? Fortunately for me we haven't had that happen. So she's keeping it from you. Let's be real, I mean. Listen, maybe. Yeah, yeah, I don't want to think about that but, you know, I think that's every father. For sure. Stay away. Stay away. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Nobody allowed. But I'm not. Kind of but not really. You could feel his energy shift when I started talking about his 16-year-old dating. Kobe's new book is out tomorrow, Looking forward to that thanks, Eva.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The basketball legend discusses his new children's book and what it's like raising four daughters.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190902_gma_kobe3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
