Or just desperate to toss anything at Trump \u2014 in the hope something will stick to justify impeachment.", "description": "Trouble is, the Times\u2019 story offered scant evidence to show the president crossed any lines, just as the text of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to show any wrongdoing by Trump.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/afp_1kw65y.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
