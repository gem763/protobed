Romney called the effort \"wrong and appalling.\"\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney tweeted Friday.\n\n\"By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" he added.\n\nGOP Sen.
