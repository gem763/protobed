You can form your own view.

Perhaps there\u2019s even a sense of levelling an imaginary playing field, for perceived overcharging, for example.\n\nAnd yet the other kind of fraud considered acceptable by otherwise upstanding members of the public who wouldn\u2019t dream of committing other crimes, even other types of fraud, often hits the smallest trader hardest.\n\nClaimed non-delivery, when ordering goods online and falsely claiming they never arrived to get a refund, can and does cause sole traders to go under.\n\nThe focus of online transactions is usually on the risks to the purchaser. One in four Britons has been victims of fraud when buying online. Typically losing out by \u00a3608, one in seven victims have been defrauded by more than \u00a31,000.\n\nBut the figures pale into insignificance compared with the fate of sellers in the hands of fraudsters posing as buyers.\n\nNearly half of those people who\u2019ve sold an item or service online have been defrauded by a buyer, according to data from secure payments service Shieldpay. One in every 10 sellers has been defrauded by more than \u00a35,000.\n\nThe chances of a shift in attitude seem limited though, not least because those businesses with the resources to alter the fraud game are far more fixated on detection and prosecution of consumer fraud rather than prevention.\n\nThis is despite the fact that detection can be problematic and prevention is generally accepted by experts as more effective.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to raise awareness of the consequences of what can be considered everyday fraud, such as finding it difficult to obtain a financial product or a mobile phone account, and in some cases, such as being a money mule, ending up with a criminal record,\u201d says Haley.\n\nThe Cifas report argues that efforts to reduce fraud would be better directed towards awareness campaigns focused on educating consumers about different types of fraud and their consequences, such as criminal records, fines, or difficulties in obtaining banking and credit facilities.", "description": "Britons have an ambivalent attitude towards\u00a0fraud,\u00a0the latest data suggests, with almost 40 per cent believing the most common kinds of financial theft are \u201creasonable\u201d.
