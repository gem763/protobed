To date, he has escalated every war he inherited, and the number of drone strikes in less than three years of his presidency far exceeds the number from the entire eight years of Obama\u2019s. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Trump is not averse to using force, and he has sent more troops overseas since becoming president than he has brought back.\n\nHis on-again, off-again quasi-withdrawals from Syria are a perfect example of how he can\u2019t quite bring himself to end our illegal military presence in another country. Withdrawing from Syria should be a lay-up for a president who genuinely wants to \u201cget out.\u201d The mission was never authorized by Congress, there is no international mandate for our military presence there, and there is no popular appetite for keeping U.S. troops in that country. Somehow it is almost 2020 and U.S. troops are still there. Trump\u2019s determined effort to keep U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition going in the face of Congressional demands to cut off all weapons and assistance shows that he has no intention of \u201cgetting out\u201d of that conflict. He is unwilling to follow through on what Kennan once called \u201ca resolute and courageous liquidation of unsound positions.\u201d Far from wanting to \u201cget out\u201d of our involvement in Yemen, Trump has tied himself and the U.S. as closely as possible to the belligerents that continue to bomb and starve that poor country.\n\nBen Friedman spotted the central flaw in Sanger\u2019s analysis:\n\nHow can the @nytimes publish \"new analysis\" pontificating about Trump's national security strategy is \"get out\" that never points out that Trump hasn't gotten out of anything: no war, no alliance, nothing. Why not analyze that rhetoric results gap?https://t.co/5dNtdfjCwe \u2014 Ben Friedman (@BH_Friedman) October 8, 2019\n\nThe only things that Trump ever wants to quit are the arms control treaties and nonproliferation agreements that stabilize relations with other states and make the world more secure. Otherwise, he escalates the shooting wars and launches one economic war after another. Trump \u201cgets out\u201d of the things he should stay in, and he stays in when he should get out.\n\nEven this latest Syria decision doesn\u2019t point to \u201cgetting out\u201d of Syria so much as it shows how easily foreign governments can get Trump to alter U.S. policy to suit their interests. The president hopes to get credit for bringing troops home at the same time that he keeps them in open-ended, illegal missions for years to come, and he might get away with it if we paid attention only to what he said and not what was actually happening. Rep. Amash summed it up very well yesterday, and I\u2019ll quote him again:\n\nHe\u2019s not bringing home the troops.\n\nHe\u2019s not ending any war.\n\nStop falling for it. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump professes to put American interests first, but frequently caters to the preferences of foreign governments at the expense of American interests. He claims to be ending endless wars, but he never ends any of them. We need to judge Trump by his actions and not his words, and if we don\u2019t we will keep getting our analysis wrong.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-28-at-10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
