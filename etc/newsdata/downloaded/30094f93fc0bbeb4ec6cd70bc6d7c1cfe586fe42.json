It\u2019s known for its twee soundtrack (The Pixies! The Doves! Regina Spektor!); its inversion of romantic comedy stereotypes (\u201cThis is a story of boy meets girl, but this is not a love story,\u201d so begins the narrator); its characterisation (haven\u2019t we all, at some point, been heartbroken by a Summer Finn?). In the ten years since its UK release, (500) Days of Summer \u2013 which currently holds an 85 percent audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 has become a sort of indie classic. It\u2019s apparently up there with Garden State and Her and all the other films that made straight boys everywhere think their brief interaction with a \u201cquirky\u201d girl was profoundly poetic, a life-altering experience, so shaken were they by the fact she\u2019d heard of The Smiths.\n\nBut unlike other films that came out in 2009 \u2013 Jennifer\u2019s Body, He\u2019s Just Not That Into You, Paranormal Activity \u2013 its flaws have not marinated over the years to form something cultish and quotable. Instead they\u2019re made more potent, maybe even duller, with time. We\u2019re given a lead character (Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who repeatedly idealises, blames and struggles to control his casual lover (Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel). Summer, in turn, is given no room to be seen as a whole, nuanced person. Instead she appears as an almost glazy-eyed mirage in a blue dress, experienced only through Tom\u2019s eyes, none of her unknowable blanks coloured-in or explained. On a recent rewatch, this film hasn't aged well.\n\nI\u2019m not the only person who thinks this. Perspectives around the film have always been divisive and discourse-heavy. Speaking to Playboy in 2012, even Gordon-Levitt admitted he didn't like his character. \u201cHe develops a mildly delusional obsession over a girl onto whom he projects all these fantasies,\u201d he remembered. \u201cHe thinks she\u2019ll give his life meaning because he doesn\u2019t care about much else going on in his life\u2026 That\u2019s not healthy. That\u2019s falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person.\u201d Others, too, have criticised the film's incorporation of the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' trope, in which the MPDG (in this case Summer) exists solely for one purpose: to teach the brooding, man-child protagonist (in this case Tom) how to embrace life in all of its infinite, sparkling colour \u2013 even though she ultimately leaves him.\n\nAn unlikeable protagonist does not always make for an unlikeable film. There are countless films \u2013 from Scarface to Clockwork Orange, Twilight to Sideways \u2013 in which the main character's values, insights or personality might misalign with the viewer's, and sometimes this makes for an even richer experience. But (500) Days of Summer doesn't really fit into this category. Tom's perspective is never presented as anything other than reality (are we supposed to feel happy for him at the end when he finds a new girl, Autumn, for whom he can project his ideals?). Summer's feelings and motives are never fully explained (why would you invite your ex to your engagement party a few weeks later, I'm so confused?). And all the other characters feel like a bit like extras on Friends \u2013 easy to watch in their various contexts, but ultimately pointless to the wider narrative.\n\nI could just be being cynical. As someone who regularly watches crap rom coms and reality TV shows, hungover and sprawled across my bed in my pants eating potato-based snacks, I can understand that a film doesn't have to be \"good\" to be enjoyable. If that was the case, I wouldn't be sticking on The Holiday each Christmas, or finding grainy streams of Jackie Collins novels adapted into low budget movies starring Susan Somers. But I think what makes (500) Days of Summer especially grating is that it pretends to be something it isn't. It's a Richard Curtis film disguised as Eternal Sunshine, a regular stock Hollywood rom-com disguised as True Romance, a descendent of High Fidelity without actually being one.\n\nWho knows what (500) Days of Summer would have looked like had it been made today. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope has thankfully become less prominent, more dated. Uncomfortable encounters with ex-lovers happen on social media, rather than park benches (there's no way Tom wouldn't have known Summer was engaged now, when he'd likely be poring over her tagged posts on IG). In general, perhaps, our relationship to relationships have become more casual and less defined. I've encountered more Summer-like approaches in recent years than Tom-like approaches, which might be considered a positive thing (it's not fair to expect one person to be your everything forever). In that way, (500) Days of Summer is a very 2009 film. But unlike some of the classic films it's been compared to, maybe it should just stay there.\n\n@daisythejones", "description": "The twee 'anti rom com' was released ten years ago and has left behind a very specific legacy.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "David Gilbert", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d5fb105b3c3560008cd7fc3/lede/1566552336990-4117650023_0b5b9a2cea_o.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8432xh;0xw,0.0561xh&resize=1200:*"}
