The proposed fine represents 1.5% of BA's annual turnover.\n\nThe ICO's investigation found that a variety of information was compromised by \"poor security arrangements\", including log in, payment card and travel booking details as well as customers' names and addresses.\n\nIn a statement after the fine was announced, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: \"People's personal data is just that - personal.\n\n\"When an organisation fails to protect it from loss, damage or theft it is more than an inconvenience.\n\n\"That's why the law is clear - when you are entrusted with personal data you must look after it.\n\n\"Those that don't will face scrutiny from my office to check they have taken appropriate steps to protect fundamental privacy rights.\"\n\nAlex Cruz, British Airways' chairman and chief executive, said at the time that the airline was \"surprised and disappointed\" in the ICO's initial finding.\n\nHe added: \"British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers' data.\n\n\"We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft.\n\n\"We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this event caused.\"", "description": "Passenger payment details and addresses were stolen in the cyber attack where customers were taken to a fake website", "authors": ["Mark Chandler", "Image", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Afp", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19634523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Generic-transport-pics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
