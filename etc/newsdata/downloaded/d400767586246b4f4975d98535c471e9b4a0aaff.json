Bonus rewards means a cardholder earns 2% or 2 points per dollar in a given category. In this case, grocery stores. We compared each card on a range of features, including cash-back rewards, welcome bonus, introductory and standard APR, balance transfer fee and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit score and customer reviews when available. We also considered additional perks, the application process and how easy it is for the consumer to redeem points. CNBC Select teamed up with location intelligence firm Esri. The company's data development team provided the most up-to-date and comprehensive consumer spending data based on the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can read more about their methodology here. Esri's data team created a sample annual budget of approximately $21,852 in retail spending. This budget is comprised of the most common spending categories, including groceries ($5,019), gas ($2,394), dining out ($3,365), travel ($2,154), utilities ($4,959) and general purchases ($3,961). General purchases include items such as housekeeping supplies, clothing, personal care products, prescription drugs and vitamins, and other vehicle expenses. CNBC Select used this budget to estimate how much the average consumer would save over the course of a year, two years and five years, assuming they would attempt to maximize their rewards potential by earning all welcome bonuses offered and using the card for all applicable purchases. All rewards total estimations are net the annual fee. It's important to note the value of a point or mile varies from card to card and based on how you redeem them. When we calculated the estimated returns, we assumed that cardholders are redeeming points/miles for a typical maximum value of 1 cent per point or mile. (Extreme optimizers might be able to achieve more value.) Our final picks are weighted heavily toward the highest five-year returns, since it's generally wise to hold onto a credit card for years. This method also avoids giving an unfair advantage to cards with large welcome bonuses.\n\nBest credit cards for grocery shopping Credit card Estimated grocery rewards earned each year Estimated rewards earned after five years Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express $301 $2,457 American Express\u00ae Gold Card $201 $2,631 Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card $188 $2,253 PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card $151 $2,173 Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express $151 $2,023\n\nFor rates and fees of the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express, please click here.
