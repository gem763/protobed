We should not be discouraged,\u201d he added.\n\nA Social Democrat, Zaev came to power in 2017, ousting the right-wing party of former strongman Nikola Gruevksi who had been in power for a decade.\n\nSince then, his government has poured all of its political capital into putting North Macedonia on a path to EU membership.\n\nThat included embarking on a complicated and politically risky effort to change his country\u2019s name \u2014 which was previously Macedonia \u2014 to resolve a long-running row with Greece which had been seen as the major stumbling block for any future EU integration.\n\nBrussels had pushed hard for the name change and promised the Balkan state would be rewarded.\n\nApart from France, all the other EU states accepted that North Macedonia had made enough progress on reforms to start talks.\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron refused to budge from his position that the entire accession process must first be reformed before taking in new members.\n\nThe failure to follow through is now \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the EU\u2019s credibility in the Western Balkans region, said James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans expert at the London School of Economics.\n\nZaev\u2019s government had \u201cstaked its whole reputation on settling the name issue in return for EU talks,\u201d he said.\n\nburs-ssm/jh", "description": "Skopje (Republic of North Macedonia) (AFP) \u2013 North Macedonia\u2019s prime minister on Saturday called for an early election after the EU decided", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/557d57_change-was-unblock-eu-talks-but-it-didn-courtesy-france-macedonia-pm-calls-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
