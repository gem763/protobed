I\u2019m really happy for him. You can see what it does for him, even after the first freekick,\u201d Van Persie said.\n\n\u201cYou could see he just became lively and happy, and he was making all sorts of movements and skills. Then it\u2019s great for him to score the winner as well.\n\n\u201cThe price tag doesn\u2019t really matter... You need a moment to show everyone, the Arsenal fans, \u2018here I am\u2019... I\u2019m pretty sure that after tonight you will see a different Pepe to the last couple of months.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.7788 pounds)", "description": "Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe will start to show fans why the club made him their record signing after the Ivorian forward scored two late goals in Thursday's 3-2 Europa League win over Vitoria, former defender Martin Keown said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444718585&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O065", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
