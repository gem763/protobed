Experts Weigh In", "language": "en", "text": "Sanders got a more mixed reception\n\nMr. Sanders had some good moments, the strategists agreed, but not as consistent or energizing a performance as Ms. Warren.\n\n\u201cBernie just gave the best definition of Democratic Socialism I\u2019ve ever heard. The key is to link it to quality-of-life improvements for Americans.\u201d \u2014 Frank Luntz, Republican pollster and consultant \u201cYes, he is authentic and consistent. But in a campaign you need to find some way to talk to people who don\u2019t already support you. I never hear that case from him.\u201d \u2014 Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator\n\nBiden started strong but stumbled later\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had inconsistent showings in the last two debates, did very well in the first part of the debate, several strategists said.\n\n\u201cThis is the Joe people were hoping to get as the front-runner.\u201d \u2014 Jess McIntosh, SiriusXM host and former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton \u201cWhen Biden talks about international issues, his entire demeanor changes. He is so tight, his posture changes. He should just hang on to this lane so hard, no one else can touch him in it.\u201d \u2014 Jess Morales Rocketto\n\nBut when the moderator Linsey Davis asked him about his record on race and desegregation, he faltered.\n\n\u201c@JoeBiden demonstrating a deep weakness on understanding and discussing race. Asked a question about #slavery and he stumbled through a nonsense answer that went from segregation to Venezuela.\u201d \u2014 Anna Sampaio, professor of ethnic studies and political science at Santa Clara University\n\nHarris had some of the debate\u2019s best lines\n\nSenator Kamala Harris of California got good reviews for several exchanges, as well as for her focus on \u2014 baiting of, really \u2014 President Trump.\n\n\u201c@KamalaHarris aces her opening statement with a powerful direct address to @realDonaldTrump, then closes with wit: \u2018And now you can go back to watching Fox News.\u2019 Very effective. Allows the audience to see her going toe-to-toe with Trump.\u201d \u2014 Paul Begala, former adviser to President Bill Clinton \u201cFrankly, I think @KamalaHarris is trying to provoke @realDonaldTrump to go after her on Twitter. She wants him to insult her (\u2018punch down\u2019), which would help her rise in electability (and the polls) vis a vis @JoeBiden.\u201d \u2014 Lara M. Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University\n\nCastro\u2019s swing at Biden fell flat\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, went after Mr. Biden early and hard, suggesting that his memory was failing. Strategists and commentators on both sides of the aisle cringed.\n\n\u201cYeah, not sure the goading on age/forgetfulness is a good look.\u201d \u2014 Kelly Dittmar, assistant professor of political science at Rutgers \u201cDemocratic voters are not going to like Julian Castro\u2019s badgering of Joe Biden. That might play well with parts of Dem Twitter, but not the rest of the Dem electorate.\u201d \u2014 Frank Luntz \u201c@JulianCastro with a cheap shot on @JoeBiden. Joe fights back, then pulls up, knowing better than to punch down. Castro looks desperate; Biden ends the fight with a smile.\u201d \u2014 Paul Begala\n\nBut Mr. Castro did earn some praise at other points, including for his discussion of race, and some argued that \u2014 whatever the merits of his jab at Mr. Biden \u2014 his boldness was admirable.\n\n\u201cReally the thing about @JulianCastro is that he has been totally fearless in these debates and he\u2019s moved the conversation forward at every stage.\u201d \u2014 Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, a liberal advocacy group\n\nAs for the rest \u2026\n\nSeveral other candidates had bright moments but did not manage to stand out in the overall reckoning.\n\n\u201c@BetoORourke is really moving on this issue of banning assault weapons. Very, very powerful.\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama \u201cCory Booker speaks so passionately and compassionately on issues of racial justice that it\u2019s hard not to be moved.\u201d \u2014 Mo Elleithee \u201c@amyklobuchar just delivered a strong case for the public option & even had a good zinger (\u2018While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill.\u2019) @ewarren is right that a single-payer system would be more efficient. But I am not confident Ds can win that argument in the suburbs.\u201d \u2014 Laura Belin \u201cPowerful personal testimony from @PeteButtigieg about coming out ... he\u2019s right \u2014 this election is about the voters and empowering/trusting them.\u201d \u2014 Kurt Bardella, Democratic media strategist and former Republican congressional spokesman\n\nAs for the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, he drew a great deal of attention at the start for announcing that he would give 10 Americans $1,000 a month for a year. But by the time the debate ended three hours later, he had been greatly overshadowed.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren drew praise for her grasp of policy, and Kamala Harris had some of the night\u2019s best lines.
