The company says it works with 70% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nBox has had a tough year, issuing disappointing guidance in June. Its shares are down 12% this year after falling 20% in 2018.\n\nStarboard tends to agitate for changes at companies, waging proxy battles if necessary. It has bought stakes in other tech companies, including Yahoo! (now owned by Verizon) and Symantec (SYMC). Both ended up giving board seats to Starboard candidates. This time, Starboard has revealed little about its strategy at Box, saying only in a filing that the shares, \u201cwhen purchased, were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity.\u201d Representatives of the firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Box said: \u201cWhile we do not comment on interactions with our investors, Box is committed to maintaining an active and engaged dialogue with stockholders. The board of directors and management team are focused on delivering growth and profitability to drive long-term stockholder value as we continue to pioneer the cloud content management market.\u201d\n\nLast year, Box converted its Class B shares, which had 10 times the voting power of its Class A shares, into Class A shares. Box has a market value of $2.2 billion.\n\nWrite to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com", "description": "Activist investor Starboard Value is known for agitating for changes at companies.
