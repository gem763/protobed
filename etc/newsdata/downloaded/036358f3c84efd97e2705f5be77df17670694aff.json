NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\" the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe also addressed controversy over Vice President Mike Pence's stay at his Irish resort in Doonbeg.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with the decision of our great [VP] Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland. Mike's family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!\" Trump wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Air Force defended the decision on Saturday, saying Turnberry was \"the closest available and least expensive accommodations\" for the crew members en route to Kuwait.\n\n\"The stopover of a U.S. Air Force C-17 in Glasgow, Scotland is not unusual.
