It needs to stop.\"\n\nMcKenna, the environment and climate change minister for the four years leading up to last month's election call, told The Canadian Press last month that the threats and verbal abuse she's experienced since her election in 2015 have moved from online to real life.\n\nMP Catherine McKenna spoke to reporters Thursday morning after her campaign office was defaced with sexist graffiti. 0:58\n\nWhen asked Thursday whether the latest incident makes her second-guess her decision to enter politics, McKenna responded with a firm \"no.\"\n\n\"In fact, it makes it just so clear why it's so important to go into politics,\" she said. \"Some people clearly want to chase women out of politics \u2014 that's not going to make politics any better.\"\n\nMcKenna linked the vulgar graffiti to the recent federal election campaign, which she called \"very negative and divisive.\"\n\nThe Ottawa MP was re-elected Monday by more than 15,000 votes, according to Elections Canada. To McKenna, the graffiti is a further sign there's an ongoing need to improve politics in Canada, even now that the campaign is over.\n\n\"It's just going to make me re-commit to making it a better place for women [and] for diversity of all sorts.\"\n\nThere was some vandalism to McKenna's signs during the recent federal election campaign, but nothing like this, her office said.\n\nThanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexMunter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AlexMunter</a> Hope that those responsible will step forward but in the meantime as the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ottawacity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ottawacity</a> Council's Liaison on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Women?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Women</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/genderequity?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#genderequity</a> I consider what happened a hate crime against women and ask that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OttawaPolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OttawaPolice</a> treat it as such. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ottnews?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ottnews</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iedSJTDlMu\">https://t.co/iedSJTDlMu</a> \u2014@tm_kavanagh\n\nOther politicians rallied behind McKenna Thursday, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who called the vandalism \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"There is no place in Canada for hate like this,\" Ford tweeted. \"While we may disagree on matters, we must always respect one another.\"\n\n\"It's horrible. Words can't express how angry I feel that someone would do this,\" said Coun. Theresa Kavanagh, who serves as Ottawa city council's special liaison on women's issues.\n\nKavanagh called for the tagging to be treated as a hate crime.\n\n\"We can't let it go. We have to make an example of it and come out strongly that this is unacceptable,\" Kavanagh said.\n\nOttawa police said unless there is corroborating evidence of a hate crime, the vandalism on McKenna's office would be considered mischief.\n\nA spokesperson said no charges have yet been laid.", "description": "Whoever spray-painted a\u00a0vulgar word across the front window of Catherine McKenna's campaign office overnight has failed in their attempt to chase women out of politics, the\u00a0Ottawa Centre MP said Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333485.1571929681!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/catherine-mckenna-ottawa-centre-office-vandalism.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
