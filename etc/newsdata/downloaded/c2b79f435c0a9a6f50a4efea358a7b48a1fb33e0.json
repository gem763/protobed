As we detailed here and here, the case broke wide open in March, when the government unsealed an indictment and criminal complaint against scores of parents who were desperate to get their kids into colleges they otherwise could not get into on their own merit, passing them off as recruited athletes.\n\nThe 52nd defendant is Xiaoning Sui, from British Columbia, Canada. She was arrested in Spain this week and charged by indictment in federal district court in Boston. Extradition proceedings to get her back to the United States will start soon.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Sui conspired with the ringleader William \u201cRick\u201d Singer to get her son into UCLA as a soccer recruit, and paid Singer $400,000 to accomplish the task.\n\nSinger took photographs of Sui\u2019s son\u2014a tennis player\u2014and worked with co-conspirator and government cooperator Laura Janke, who pleaded guilty on March 14 and will be sentenced Jan. 18. Janke fabricated a soccer profile for the boy, passing him off as an ace player for two private soccer clubs in Canada.\n\nSinger, in turn, worked with the head men\u2019s soccer coach at UCLA, Jorge Salcedo, to pass the boy off to the UCLA admissions office as a top recruit for Salcedo.\n\nIt worked. The boy was admitted as a soccer recruit, and was awarded a 25% scholarship as part of his recruitment.\n\nSinger reportedly mailed a check to Salcedo for $100,000. Salcedo was indicted and arraigned in federal court in March, pleaded not guilty, and has a status hearing with the judge in Boston on Oct. 1.\n\nLike all defendants, Salcedo is presumed under the law to be innocent, unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nRecall that Singer was the \u201cfixer\u201d who the parents worked with to get their children into college by the \u201cside door\u201d\u2014the phrase that he used when working with parents, accepting their money, fixing test scores, and bribing college officials.\n\nApparently, the \u201cfront door,\u201d the standard way of trying to get into college\u2014get good grades, take the SAT/ACT on your own, apply to college, and see if you are admitted\u2014wasn\u2019t good enough for these defendants.\n\nNor was the \u201cback door,\u201d which apparently is to give huge sums of money to a college for a dormitory, sports field, or endowment, because there was no guarantee that your progeny would be accepted by the admissions office.\n\nThe Massachusetts U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has created a handy webpagethat lists each defendant, the charges, the case status, the sentence the government has recommended, and the sentence the district court judge imposed.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, there are two categories of defendants: those charged by an indictment (which is returned by a grand jury) and those charged by an information (a charging document filed by the U.S. attorney, in which the defendant waives his or her right to have the charges presented to a grand jury, which often happens when a plea agreement has been reached).\n\nTwenty-three defendants have pleaded guilty to an information, including actress Felicity Huffman. Huffman was one of two defendants to date who have been sentenced. Six defendants, including Singer, have agreed to cooperate with the government\u2019s investigation.\n\nTwenty-five defendants have pleaded not guilty, including another actress, Lori Laughlin. Two defendants have not yet pleaded, and two others have filed motions to dismiss their indictments.\n\nThe next date to watch is Oct. 2, when several of the defendants have status conferences with the trial judge.\n\nBehind the scenes, government prosecutors no doubt have been providing defense lawyers with a preview of their case against each defendant, who in turn will discuss with their attorneys the pros and cons of contesting the charges or pleading guilty.\n\nThe fact that Singer has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government strengthens the government\u2019s hand in many, if not most, of these cases.\n\nExpect to see more guilty pleas by those indicted, and likely more charges filed against new defendants as this sordid tale continues to unspool.", "description": "Fifty-two defendants and counting.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s how many people have been indicted or otherwise charged in the college-admissions and testing-bribery scandal.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen the story first broke last spring, we\u00a0wrote\u00a0that the first round of indictments had to be the tip of the iceberg, because over time, those in the government crosshairs would sing like a bird\u2014and boy, have they ever.", "authors": ["Charles Stimson", "Commentary By", "Senior Legal Fellow", "Manager", "National Security Law Program", "Legal Fellow"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1130231506.jpg?itok=ME5eFHes", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
