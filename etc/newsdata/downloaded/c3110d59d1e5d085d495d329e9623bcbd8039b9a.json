Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nJoker is many things to many people \u2014 a misguided commentary on mental illness and sociopolitical rage, a glorification of incels, an antidote to \u201cwoke\u201d culture, etc. etc. \u2014 but everyone can agree that, feelings aside, it tells the story of an aspiring stand-up comedian. And even though it\u2019s not a funny movie, unless your sense of humor is beyond warped, it employs several bona fide comics: Marc Maron, Saturday Night Live\u2019s Chris Redd, Late Night With Seth Meyers writer Ben Warheit (as one of the subway victims), and stand-ups Gary Gulman and Sam Morril playing themselves, performing snippets of their real-life acts at Gotham City club Pogo\u2019s, where Arthur Fleck disastrously goes onstage at an open mic.\n\nGiven that director Todd Phillips strove to tell Joker\u2019s origin story with gritty realism, it made sense that he chose real-life stand-ups for Arthur to emulate. Morril landed his role by getting a call from Phillips himself, while Gulman was suggested by a casting staffer. \u201cIt was out of the blue. I\u2019m assuming that they couldn\u2019t go with somebody too famous, because it would take you out of the scene,\u201d Gulman tells Vulture. \u201cI had no lines, but Todd and I went over what I wanted to do for jokes, and he said it needed to be something that wouldn\u2019t flag what time period they were in.\u201d\n\nThey ultimately went with Gulman\u2019s bit about role-playing with his wife, while Morril did different segments from his act, with one about sex and cars making the final cut. \u201cI was like, \u2018If I\u2019m at an open mic, do you want me to bomb?\u2019\u201d Morril recalls asking Phillips. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018No, do whatever.\u2019 I said, \u2018Good,\u2019 because I don\u2019t want to bomb with my own jokes. That\u2019d be pretty weird: \u2018Here\u2019s my jokes not hitting in the biggest movie in the country.\u2019\u201d (Both comics also declined to tell friends they were in the movie, thinking their scenes might be cut.)\n\nTo give it the early-\u201980s feel, Phillips chose Dangerfield\u2019s, Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s longtime New York City club, as the filming location. \u201cIt\u2019s a dated club, so they probably didn\u2019t have to do that much to make it work,\u201d says Gulman. \u201cThere were matchbooks that said Pogo\u2019s on it, and the people in the audience were dressed in period outfits with their hair done, smoking cigarettes.\u201d Though the extras for Morril\u2019s set were welcoming \u2014 \u201cI think they were expecting me to suck,\u201d he says \u2014 Gulman had a harder time with the crowd at first.\n\n\u201cThe first five or six takes, I was irritated because there was an extra laughing too loud. I was thinking, Are they trying to get a bigger part? They\u2019re ruining my timing. Then I realized it was the Joker,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Joaquin Phoenix would be in my shot. I figured they\u2019d have his stand-in. Once I calmed down from feeling like an idiot for not realizing who it was, it was really smooth.\u201d\n\nThe scene may seem fairly insignificant, with Phoenix enjoying Gulman\u2019s set and jotting down notes about eye contact and making jokes about sex, but the details are actually pivotal to Arthur\u2019s attempts at comedy. \u201cThey made me a time-period suit. Phillips said, \u2018Arthur would be learning from you and taking notes and he would try to dress like you.\u2019 He even slicked his hair back like me,\u201d Gulman recalls, noting that the point of his role-playing bit, in which he pretends to be a very strict professor, is that it\u2019s not sexy at all. \u201cHe\u2019s completely misinterpreting it. The other thing was that it was sad, because it was all couples at the show and he was by himself.\u201d\n\nGary Gulman performs stand-up in Joker.

Morril got to watch Phoenix filming that scene and was blown away by how realistic it was. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you have PTSD from all the open mics you have to do to get good at this,\u201d he says. \u201cTo their credit, that\u2019s what an open mic is. You\u2019re supposed to experiment and take risks, and that\u2019s where you\u2019re supposed to fail. But that\u2019s why I really hated mics \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind bombing, it was the sitting through all the bad comedy that made me really just hate life.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cbad comedy,\u201d Morril means the kind of set like Arthur\u2019s, where the comedian isn\u2019t just not funny, they\u2019re obviously not fully tethered to reality. What makes his take on Phoenix\u2019s performance even more interesting is that, during filming, he didn\u2019t know any of the context about the plot and, when he spoke with Vulture, he had yet to see the movie.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people who do comedy and don\u2019t have any self-awareness. He\u2019s a loner, right? Usually, when you have friends, they give you hints of what\u2019s funny about you. That felt like a character who didn\u2019t have friends guide him and tell him what was good. It felt like a very lost person. He tells that old, bad street joke, \u2018I told them I want to be a comedian and everyone laughed at me, but no one\u2019s laughing now!\u2019 When you open with a joke that\u2019s not yours, to me that shows fear that you\u2019re not a good comic. He did that a few different ways, and each way made me uncomfortable. It was pretty hard to watch.\u201d\n\nAccording to an interview with Phillips, Phoenix was often so intense on the set that he\u2019d walk off in the middle of takes to gather his thoughts. Neither Gulman or Morril saw anything as over the top as that, but both had interesting interactions with the star. \u201cWhen I saw him in the makeup trailer, it seemed like he was like in character because he didn\u2019t really make eye contact,\u201d says Gulman. \u201cHe was friendly in that he smiled and nodded his head, but also maybe he just doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around strangers. It\u2019s hard to say, but he is really handsome.\u201d\n\nMorril\u2019s was much different. \u201cHe chatted with me for a while and he was not what I expected,\u201d Morril says. \u201cI was scared to talk to him because I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019s the type of actor that stays in character in between takes. He said, \u2018I really like your act because it\u2019s just funny. Sometimes stand-up can feel desperate, and I don\u2019t get that feeling from you at all.\u2019 Maybe he was being nice to me as the Joker.\u201d\n\nBoth also have visceral reactions to the plot point where Arthur\u2019s set is filmed and goes viral, thanks to late-show host Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. \u201c[An open mic] is supposed to be a place where you risk absolute vulnerability,\u201d says Morril. \u201cFilming at a comedy club is terrible for a professional, but to do it to someone at their absolute worst is pretty cruel. But you know how that goes \u2014 it\u2019s in people\u2019s nature to be happy to see you in pain. It\u2019s such an ugly quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way that scene plays out, it\u2019s just so uncomfortable. I could relate to that because probably early on in my career, you\u2019re so desperate you would allow yourself to lose your dignity to get that. It was his dream,\u201d Gulman says of Joker\u2019s fateful appearance on Franklin\u2019s show. \u201cHe was right about telling that guy off for embarrassing him. It was really cruel. At first, I thought, He got this break to go on the show, and if he had just not murdered anybody, maybe it could\u2019ve helped him out \u2014 that it\u2019s just that his timing was off. I felt so bad for him, and then, like all supervillains, he took it too far. You should never, never murder the host during the show for America to see. It\u2019s just bad form.\u201d\n\nRobert De Niro and Joaquin Phoenix in Joker.

The connection was formed well before the movie, when Gulman read the 1988 graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, which first gave Joker the backstory of being a failed comedian and partly inspired Phillips\u2019s movie. \u201cI was struggling with comedy when I read that because I was so new and it was so frustrating,\u201d Gulman says. \u201cI remember thinking, Only a failed comedian could have the frustration to go out there and become a supervillain, because it\u2019s so humbling and you want to be good so bad. That origin story made more sense to me than falling in a vat of chemicals.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that, combined with Arthur\u2019s horrifically excruciating open mic performance, that made Joker\u2019s stand-up plotline ring true to Gulman. \u201cYou need that kind of delusion of, I\u2019m going to be really great at this,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re horrible and just flailing around. I don\u2019t know how you can do it without confidence, but at the same time, you deserve no confidence because you\u2019re so bad. So, it makes sense that you would have a bit of delusion. But then there\u2019s this next level where people go on and tell very personal stories, and it makes me very uncomfortable watching.\n\n\u201cSome people, you could see This person has funny ideas. Other people, it was sad, and you hoped they would find their way at some point, but you would never see them do comedy again. They would just disappear from the scene. I never saw anybody as out there [like] Arthur, but there were people who you thought, Wow, this person is ill. I thought it was really accurate.\u201d\n\nMorril agrees with Gulman, but while he found the open-mic scene painful to watch on set, he loves knowing he got the experience to kill in Joker \u2014 in the good way of getting the most laughs. \u201cI thought, Man, this is so uncomfortable, but also, I just went onstage, opened, and buried Joaquin Phoenix,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, how funny is that?\u201d", "description": "Talking with stand-up comedians Gary Gulman and Sam Morril about landing parts in Todd Phillips\u2019s movie \u2018Joker,\u2019 what the film gets right about stand-up and open mics, and working with Joaquin Phoenix.", "authors": ["Dan Reilly"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-joker.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
