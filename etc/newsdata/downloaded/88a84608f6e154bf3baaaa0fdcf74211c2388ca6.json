Giuliani pressed for help in securing the release of a jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey.\n\nThe request by Mr. Giuliani provoked an immediate objection from Mr. Tillerson, who argued that it would be highly inappropriate to interfere in an open criminal case, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe gold trader, Reza Zarrab, had been accused by federal prosecutors of playing a central role in an effort by a state-owned Turkish bank to funnel more than $10 billion worth of gold and cash to Iran, in defiance of United States sanctions designed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nBut at the White House meeting in early 2017, Mr. Giuliani and his longtime friend and colleague, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, pushed back on Mr. Tillerson\u2019s objections.", "description": "The lawyer had asked that President Trump and Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, help a client who was accused in a $10 billion scheme to thwart sanctions on Iran.", "authors": ["Jo Becker", "Maggie Haberman", "Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/multimedia/10dc-gold-01/merlin_128860991_515f45cd-79d9-4cb1-8039-df1c6a6e01e9-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
