While that can be hard to picture, think of it this way: a family of four who diligently turns off their faucet every time they brush will save 11,000 gallons [41,640L] a year \u2014 more than a month of average water usage. So by doing this simple action, that household can cut their water use from 12 months to 10-and-a-half months, saving 13 per cent on their water bill \u2014 about $65 [$US96] a year for the average household, as David LaFrance, CEO of the American Water Works Association, explained.\n\nI already know that saving $96 a year isn\u2019t an overwhelming amount of money, and that the amount saved will vary for Australians, so don\u2019t @ me. But cutting your family\u2019s water usage by 41,640L per year is worth considering.\n\nI also know that many of us already turn off the water when we brush our teeth. I was taught to brush that way, and I suspect many Millennials had similar experiences. One of our Lifehacker editors, for example, learned about the environmental benefits of water-free brushing from public television:\n\nBut a lot of people still leave the water running while they brush, sending a lot of water straight down the drain.\n\nOf course, the next step after learning how to only use the tap when you need to wet or rinse your toothbrush is learning how to only use the shower when you need to wet or rinse your body. The average family uses nearly 151L of water per day showering, according to the EPA \u2014 so adopting the \u201cNavy shower\u201d can save even more water than adopting Barney\u2019s preferred toothbrushing method.\n\nDon\u2019t want to go that far, even for the Earth? That\u2019s fair. I haven\u2019t started taking Navy showers yet either. But I keep thinking about it, which means I\u2019ll probably end up trying it at some point.\n\nThe big difference, from my perspective, is that letting water run directly into the sink while you brush your teeth is wasteful, while letting water run onto your body as you soap it up is relaxing. Plus, I have my best thoughts in the shower! Don\u2019t we all?\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll keep up the habit of turning off the water while I brush my teeth. It\u2019s an easy way to save a few litres of water and keep a few extra dollars in my pocket, after all.", "description": "If you are one of the many people who leave the water running while you brush your teeth, here are two good arguments for changing your habit....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/s9t8d8r39bngqqw492kg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
