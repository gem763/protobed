REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nRepublican U.S. President Donald Trump won the White House three years ago in large part by carrying three swing states that will be critical in the November 2020 election: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut as he has ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports in an effort to force the world\u2019s second-biggest economy to sign a trade deal more beneficial to the United States, he has added to a global slowdown that is crimping demand for U.S. exports.\n\nAnd swing states are feeling the effects.\n\nBusiness activity in five Midwestern states including Michigan and Wisconsin tracked at slower than its historical average for the fourth month running in July, the Chicago Fed\u2019s Midwest Economic Index showed Friday.\n\nThe decline, the longest stretch in three years, was driven by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, said Chicago Fed economist Thomas Walstrum.\n\nA manufacturing survey by the Philadelaphia Fed released earlier this month, covering the key swing state of Pennsylvania, meanwhile, showed a possible turn in job growth, an area of strength for the U.S. economy nationally.\n\nThough the regional Fed survey pointed to continued overall growth in manufacturing, the number of firms cutting jobs jumped to 21% compared with 6% in the July survey. The number of firms adding workers fell from 36% to around 25%.\n\nIn the Midwest, the slowdown caught by the Chicago Fed\u2019s index does not mean a recession is underway, Walstrum said, but \u201cit\u2019s teasing us.\u201d\n\nAnd if the United States and China continue to ratchet up tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, he said, \u201cyou\u2019d continue to expect downward pressure\u201d on the states in the index, which also covers activity in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa.\n\nFor a graphic, please see here\n\nFed policymakers are watching such data closely as they gear up for a September interest rate-setting meeting when they will decide whether the U.S. economy needs another dose of stimulus to keep it growing despite trade uncertainty and worries that economic weakness in Germany and China will continue to weigh on U.S. companies.", "description": "A decline in economic activity in the U.S. Midwest, apparent in a little-noticed report on Friday from the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, adds to evidence of slowing growth in factory-heavy corners of the country key to next year's U.S. presidential election.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424492321&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T1GP"}
