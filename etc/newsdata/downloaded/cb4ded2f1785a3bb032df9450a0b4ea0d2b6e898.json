The theory connects measurements of the same physical incident viewed from these different points in a way that depends on the relative velocity of observers. As well as this, relativity introduced the concept of time dilation, which suggests that the faster you travel, the more time seems to slow. However, special relativity breaks down if two observers relative velocity - the difference between their respective speeds - approaches the speed of light.\n\n'You have to be prepared to be embarrassed. It is very difficult to invent something that is new under the sun and actually works.'\n\nThe concept describes a ring inside a box that is sprung in one direction, while the box recoils in the other \u2013 just as Isaac Newton's laws of motion say they should.\n\nWhen the ring hits the end of the box, it will then bounce backwards, ultimately switching the direction in which the box recoils.\n\nAccording to Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, if the box and ring are travelling near the speed of light, the ring approaches the front end of the box it will increase in mass because it's going faster than when it's going backwards - so it'll hit harder, resulting in forward momentum.\n\nHowever, Burns have noted that even though it would be able to produce a forward thrust up to 99 percent the speed of light without going again Einstein's theory, this technology breaches Newton's law of motion \u2013 that an action always has an opposite and equal reaction.\n\nIn addition to breaking the laws of physics, Burns said the engine would have to be 656 feet long and 39 feet wide to be successful.\n\nAnd to add another hurdle to this design, the helical engine could only working properly in a frictionless environment, which is only found in deep space.\n\n'I know that it risks being right up there with the EM drive and cold fusion,' Burns told New Scientist.\n\nThe design, created by David burns (right), is capable of producing a thrust up to 99 percent the speed of light without breaking Einstein's (left) theory of relativity, but breaches Newton's law of motion\n\n'But you have to be prepared to be embarrassed.
