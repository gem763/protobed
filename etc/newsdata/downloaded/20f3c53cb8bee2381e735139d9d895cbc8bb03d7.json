Lions for the longest losing streak of the season.\n\nEdmonton's Logan Kilgore was 19 for 28 for 223 yards with one passing and one rushing touchdown.\n\nDominique Davis and Jonathan Jennings shared QB duties for the Redblacks.\n\nDavis got the bulk of the workload, playing most of the second half before being injured. He finished 15 for 23 for 215 yards and one rushing TD, while Jennings was 7 for 8 for 58 yards.", "description": "The Edmonton Eskimos snapped a four-game losing streak with a 21-16 win over the Ottawa Redblacks on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301748.1569711940!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/eskimos-redblacks-09289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
