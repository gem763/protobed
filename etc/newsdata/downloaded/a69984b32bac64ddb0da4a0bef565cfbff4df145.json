The people said the Transportation Department would announce that JetBlue and American Airlines flights to Santa Clara in central Cuba and Holguin and Camaguey in the island\u2019s east would be banned starting in December.\n\nFlights to Havana, which account for the great majority of U.S. flights to Cuba, will remain legal. Other banned destinations like the beach resort of Varadero do not currently have U.S. carriers serving them.\n\nThe stated reason for the move is to prevent tourism to Cuba, which is banned by U.S. law. But it is not clear how many people take the flights for tourism purposes. Many are used by Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in cities far from Havana by road.\n\n\u201cWe plan to operate in full compliance with the new policy concerning scheduled air service between the U.S. and Cuba,\u201d JetBlue said in a written statement. \u201cWe are beginning to work with our various government and commercial partners to understand the full impact of this change on our customers and operations in Camaguey, Holguin and Santa Clara.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Washington has barred U.S cruise ships visiting Cuba, sanctioned oil tankers moving petroleum from Venezuela to Cuba and permitted lawsuits against foreign companies profiting from their use of properties confiscated from Americans or from Cubans who later obtained American citizenship.\n\nThe measures have contributed to the Cuban government\u2019s chronic shortages of hard currency and were blamed for several weeks of fuel shortages on the island, but so far there is no indication that the Trump policy is having its desired effect. Cuba\u2019s security services continue to detain and harass dissenters and human rights groups say freedom of expression, assembly and other rights remain highly curtailed.\n\nThe Cuban and Venezuelan government remain tightly aligned and both have declared their intent to become even closer allies in the face of the Trump measures.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee reported this story from Washington and AP writer Michael Weissenstein reported in Havana.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Flights to all Cuban cities but Havana are being barred in the latest roll back of Obama-era relations.
