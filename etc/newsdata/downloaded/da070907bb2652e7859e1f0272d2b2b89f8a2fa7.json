Such tactics, Huawei said, also include using visa denials, detaining shipments and resurfacing settled civil cases as criminal charges. In unspecified instances, it said, the U.S. even had officials \u201cpretending to be Huawei employees\u201d to drum up charges against the company.\n\nHuawei detailed the allegations against the U.S. in a press release issued on Tuesday, in which it also denied stealing smartphone-camera technology from Portuguese multimedia producer Rui Oliveira and accused him of \u201ctaking advantage of the current geopolitical situation.\u201d\n\nChina is locked in a trade dispute with Washington and struggling to deal with protests in Hong Kong. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry earlier this year characterized U.S. actions on Huawei as \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and an attempt to block China\u2019s rise.\n\nHuawei\u2019s press release didn\u2019t provide specific evidence to back up the allegations. However, a person familiar with the matter said at least three employees from Huawei\u2019s U.S. office have been contacted by U.S. law enforcement agencies since the beginning of 2019.\n\nRelated Video The U.S. blacklisting of Huawei is cutting off American businesses from a big client.

Photo composite: Sharon Shi\n\nThe Justice Department said it doesn\u2019t comment on specific investigations but said the investigative techniques it uses are lawful. The department has said China is implicated in more than 80% of the economic espionage claims that it has charged or prosecuted. A representative for the FBI declined to comment.\n\nWhen investigating allegations of criminal misconduct at a company, it is common for FBI agents to visit current or former employees of the company at their homes, in an effort to persuade them to cooperate in their investigation and to help obtain evidence.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last week reported that U.S. prosecutors were investigating several new alleged instances of intellectual-property theft by Huawei, including allegations that it stole smartphone-camera technology from Mr. Oliveira. Huawei received a subpoena requesting documents about the instances of alleged theft, the Journal reported.\n\nMr. Oliveira plans to respond to Huawei in court next week, and declined to provide further comment, his attorney, Jeffrey Wadsworth, said in an email.\n\nIn addition to denying Mr. Oliveira\u2019s claims, Huawei leveled a number of new accusations against the U.S. Among them, it said the U.S. was \u201cinstructing law enforcement to threaten, menace, coerce, entice and incite both current and former Huawei employees to turn against the company and work for them.\u201d\n\nThe allegations are the latest exchange in a fight between the U.S. and Huawei\u2014the world\u2019s largest maker of telecommunications equipment and the No. 2 smartphone maker\u2014that has been running for more than a year.\n\nHuawei has been fighting a series of escalating actions by the U.S., including two criminal indictments and a campaign to pressure U.S. allies against using Huawei gear in their 5G network rollouts.\n\nIn an appearance with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence repeated the Trump administration\u2019s contention that Huawei gear poses a security threat.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that Chinese law requires Chinese telecom companies to provide Beijing\u2019s vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their network,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe stakes are high for Huawei and other telecom-equipment vendors as countries around the world prepare to deploy 5G, the next generation of superfast networks expected to bring connectivity to an array of new devices\u2014but that security experts and government officials say could entail new vulnerabilities.\n\nHuawei\u2019s contention that the U.S. is resurfacing resolved civil cases is an apparent reference to an indictment issued by U.S. prosecutors in January. That indictment accused Huawei of stealing smartphone-testing technology from its former partner T-Mobile US Inc. The indictment arose out of a civil suit filed by T-Mobile that was resolved in 2017, with a jury finding Huawei liable for breach of contract and ordering it to pay $4.8 million to its former partner. The dispute with Mr. Oliveira is a continuing civil case.\n\nThe allegations by Huawei come as the company has taken a more aggressive posture in response to U.S. actions in the past year. In March, the company filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court challenging portions of a law blocking its gear from being used by the government or contractors. Its once-reclusive founder and former Chinese army officer, Ren Zhengfei, has given a series of interviews hitting back at the U.S.\n\nHuawei\u2019s allegations come after wide-ranging inquiries on the company\u2019s business practices by the FBI and prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York.\n\nThe fresh lines of investigation by U.S. officials cover issues raised over two decades by people and companies that have accused Huawei of stealing their intellectual property. They overlap with a Journal story in May that detailed allegations by accusers ranging from longtime tech peers, including Cisco Technology Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., to smaller businessmen including Mr. Oliveira and a musician in Seattle.\n\nOn Tuesday, Huawei also accused the U.S. of launching investigations based on \u201cfalse media reports that target the company.\u201d Huawei singled out Mr. Oliveira, saying he was providing a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d to the media to hurt Huawei and extort from it. Mr. Oliveira told the Journal earlier this year that he met Huawei executives in May 2014 due to their interest in his two U.S. patents for a camera attachment to smartphones. He accused Huawei of stealing his intellectual property from these patents and threatened a lawsuit against Huawei.\n\nThe company sued Mr. Oliveira in March, asking a Texas federal court to issue a noninfringement ruling. The litigation remains unresolved. Huawei said it wasn\u2019t interested in Mr. Oliveira\u2019s design after their meeting and didn\u2019t use Mr. Oliveira\u2019s design, and that its product was different from Mr. Oliveira\u2019s in key aspects. Mr. Oliveira referred the accusations to an attorney.\n\nHuawei on Tuesday broadly denied the allegation that its record has been dotted with accusations of dubious methods.\n\n\u201cNo company becomes a global leader in their field through theft,\u201d it said.\n\n\u2014Aruna Viswanatha and Catherine Lucey contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com and Chuin-Wei Yap at chuin-wei.yap@wsj.com", "description": "Huawei accused the U.S. of \u201cusing every tool at its disposal\u201d to disrupt its business, including launching cyberattacks on its networks and instructing law enforcement to \u201cmenace\u201d its employees.", "authors": ["Dan Strumpf", "Chuin-Wei Yap", "Dan.Strumpf Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103415/social"}
