Politico reported in June that Chao even hired one of her husband\u2019s former campaign aides, who soon after took on a unique role in the cabinet agency: he oversaw projects that would benefit Chao\u2019s husband\u2019s home state ahead of his re-election campaign.\n\nYesterday, Politico advanced the story in ways that don\u2019t do the cabinet secretary any favors.\n\nIn her first 14 months as Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao met with officials from Kentucky, which her husband, Mitch McConnell, represents in the Senate, vastly more often than those from any other state. In all, 25 percent of Chao\u2019s scheduled meetings with local officials from any state from January 2017 to March 2018 were with Kentuckians, who make up about only 1.3 percent of the U.S. population. The next closest were Indiana and Georgia, with 6 percent of meetings each, according to Chao\u2019s calendar records, the only ones that have been made public. At least five of Chao\u2019s 18 meetings with Kentuckians were requested in emails from McConnell staffers, who alerted Chao\u2019s staffers which of the officials were \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cloyal supporters,\u201d according to records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nWhile the secretary\u2019s office denies any wrongdoing, I\u2019m trying to think of an innocent explanation for why officials from her husband\u2019s state have received special access that officials from other states have not. Nothing is coming to mind.\n\nOf course, these questions are unrelated to separate reporting alleging that the Republican cabinet secretary held onto stock in a transportation company after Chao was supposed to have divested.\n\nAnd that matter is unrelated to the House Oversight Committee investigation into Chao\u2019s curious habit of taking steps that appear designed to assist her father\u2019s family shipping business.\n\nHow that\u2019s swamp-draining effort working out?\n\nAs we recently discussed, the number of Trump administration cabinet secretaries facing controversies like these keeps growing. We recently learned, for example, that David Bernhardt, a former corporate lobbyist for the oil industry, became the subject of an ethics investigation immediately after becoming the nation\u2019s new Interior secretary. Federal prosecutors have also presented evidence to a grand jury on Ryan Zinke, Bernhardt\u2019s predecessor.\n\nThat news arrived around the same time that we learned new details about Alex Acosta, Trump\u2019s former Labor secretary, who allegedly broke the law while shielding a politically connected sex trafficker. Acosta was later forced to resign.\n\nLast year, NBC News published a list of Trump administration figures accused of crossing ethical and/or legal lines, and the list wasn\u2019t at all short. It included familiar controversies involving former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, former HHS Secretary Tom Price, former regulatory adviser Carl Icahn, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, former CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t an exhaustive tally. As we discussed at the time, there have been related controversies surrounding Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former VA Secretary David Shulkin. While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s also not overlook controversies surrounding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who seems to get more controversial all the time, and former FEMA Director Brock Long. Even acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan faced an ethics probe.\n\nIn June, Donald Trump declared with pride, \u201cThere are those that say we have one of the finest cabinets.\u201d No one has ever made such an assessment. No one ever should.", "description": "I'm trying to think of an innocent explanation for why officials from her husband's state have received special access that officials from other states have not", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/492485475.jpg?itok=4Y9PUodT", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
