Omar added, \"Congress has the constitutional right to declare war. The president doesn't have it, the Secretary of State doesn't have it, and Saudi Arabia certainly doesn't have it.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nEarlier Monday, while addressing White House reporters, President Trump continued to blame Iran for the oil field attack while simultaneously walking back his war comments. During her interview later that night, Representative Omar expressed skepticism about any information that Trump or his administration shares.\n\n\"We need to make sure that the American people understand that this administration that lies about weather maps or crowd sizes cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,\" explained Omar.\n\nThe Minnesota congresswoman, who is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, continued to stress the importance of a congressional investigation and urged her fellow representatives to consider a diplomatic approach.\n\n\"We are not in a position to think about another endless war, and I really hope that my colleagues in Congress are going to pressure this administration to take a step back and figure out how we use diplomacy in deescalating the situation,\" said representative Omar.\n\nOmar referenced the last major U.S. conflict as a warning. \"We can't forget our involvement in Iraq and how there are people who beat the drums of war and ultimately make us regret a decade or so later.\"\n\nAn administration \"that lies about weather maps\" can't be trusted on Iran\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ilhan Omar dismisses President Trump's ability to navigate escalating tensions with Iran, pointing to the controversy over Hurricane Dorian's path and whether it would hit Alabama. pic.twitter.com/gOK5WYqYAk \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 17, 2019\n\nOutfront With Erin Burnett airs weeknights at 7 p.m. on CNN.\n\nSee Sean Spicer make controversial debut on 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
