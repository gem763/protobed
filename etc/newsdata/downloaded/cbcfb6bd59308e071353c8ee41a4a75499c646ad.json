But is CBD more than just a wellness trend?\n\nLast month, Lisa Jenkins went for a walk alone around her local park for an hour, the first time she had done so unaided for 13 months. Jenkins was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of three. Now 46, she struggles with vertigo and dizziness, as well as muscle spasms and poor mobility. An Access to Work grant means that she can get a taxi to and from her job in advertising, but for the last three months she hasn\u2019t needed one. The difference? She believes, a few drops of grassy-tasting oil under the tongue each morning.\n\n\u201cI have been using a 5% CBD oil for six months,\u201d she says. \u201cI previously took Duloxetine [an antidepressant medication also used to treat nerve pain] which was initially helpful, but my muscle-freezing episodes came back and I stopped taking it. I was also prescribed Valium, but you can\u2019t take that during the working day.\u201d A friend suggested she try the legal cannabis derivative. She has since been taking it every morning before work, using more during the day if her muscles become tight. \u201cWithin an hour of taking those first three drops, my muscles relax,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stress in my head calms down. The longer I take it, the better things seem to be.\u201d\n\nJenkins is one of an estimated 1.3 million UK consumers who spend a total of \u00a3300m a year on cannabidiol (CBD) products. The oil contains one of the non-psychoactive chemicals found in the hemp plant \u2013 not the illegal mind-altering THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) that gets you high \u2013 and has been on the shelves of specialist health food shops and hemp \u201cdispensaries\u201d since 1998. It\u2019s 21 years since the British government first issued a licence for a cannabis extract to be developed for use in clinical trials.\n\nBut in the last few years, it has leapt into the mainstream, acquiring the ubiquity of vitamin C and the social status of something much sexier. Most commonly consumed as an oil dropped under the tongue, CBD is also available as gummy sweets, capsules, body salves and e-liquids to vape. A CBD gold rush has led to an explosion of infused products, everything from soft drinks, tea and coffee to ice-cream, toothpaste and shampoo. You can get vaginal suppositories containing CBD (\u201cweed tampons\u201d) that are said to help with pelvic pain; CBD-infused deodorants and sexual lubricant (said to promote relaxation and increase blood flow); even CBD hummus, perhaps to snack on after your lubricated endeavours.\n\nFor CBD evangelists, it seems there is no health problem it can\u2019t help \u2013 from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and skin conditions to insomnia. Many report that CBD improves concentration, memory and general mood, as well as reducing stress levels. But the products can\u2019t legally make such claims; in the UK, CBD can be sold and advertised only as a generic food supplement. \u201cWe never use any medical terminology,\u201d says Johan Obel, director of popular online CBD retailer the Drug Store, standing in front of a huge, gold-framed artwork of a nerve cell in its central London store. \u201cIf people come in asking for advice on a specific issue, we tell them to do their own research.\u201d (He adds that their sexual lubricant is \u201cby far one of our bestsellers\u201d.)\n\nThe boom in CBD-infused products on the high street is reminiscent of short-lived fads of recent years, such as our brief fixation with chia seeds, turmeric (rendering lattes highlighter-yellow) or spirulina. Only, CBD does not seem to be going anywhere. On a recent walk through London I visited a cafe serving camomile and CBD lattes, passed a yoga studio advertising CBD classes, and a bar serving CBD-infused cocktails. The CBD acronym, with its suggestion of something illicit, is catnip to anxious consumers in need of something they can\u2019t quite put their finger on.\n\n\u201cMost years there is a golden product \u2013 a \u2018Holy cow, can you believe how much of this we\u2019re selling?\u2019 thing\u201d, says Al Overton, buying director at Planet Organic. \u201cThere was the year of quinoa, the year of manuka honey, the year of the goji berry. Now it\u2019s CBD. We have been selling CBD products in our supplement section for just over two years, and it\u2019s been our fastest-growing product in that time. The majority of interested customers are female \u2013 especially those who feel that conventional pharmaceuticals aren\u2019t working for them.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s too soon to tell how much of a fixture \u201cinfused\u201d foods and drinks will become. \u201cWe see oils and capsules as more of a sophisticated and long-lasting trend, but it is early days with the \u2018edibles\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere is little evidence to support the claims CBD users make. So are we witnessing a global placebo effect?\n\nI have been using CBD oil on and off for two years myself, finances permitting. It\u2019s expensive: a bottle of 1,000mg (10%) CBD oil from Love Hemp, costing \u00a349.99, lasts three weeks on average. I started because I wanted something to help with crippling period pain and associated symptoms, including anxiety. I love the taste; a bitter, herbaceous blast, like a joint dipped in strong extra-virgin olive oil. More importantly, when I take CBD regularly I notice that, when the dreaded week of cramping and gut chaos arrives, my perception of the pain shifts; I am aware of the sensations and their cause, but am less agitated by them. It feels as if the message of pain is being delivered in a different language. But does the science back me up?\n\n***\n\nBetween 2002 and 2012 there were nine published studies on the use of CBD for the treatment of pain. By 2017, there had been 30. Almost all have shown potential benefits. However, with their small participant numbers, along with the fact that those participants are mostly rats, it is hard to make reliable claims about the human response. \u201cVery few of the claims for CBD\u2019s effects have actually been, or are being, tested,\u201d says Dr Sagnik Bhattacharyya, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s (KCL) psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience unit. Scientists there have been investigating whether large doses of CBD could help treat severe mental health problems. \u201cWe have carried out a couple of studies where we show that a single 600mg dose of cannabidiol can normalise brain function in key regions we know are abnormal in people with psychosis,\u201d he says. KCL now has funding to carry out a large-scale trial to test whether CBD could be useful in treating young people at high risk for developing psychosis. If successful, its new trial will provide \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d of CBD\u2019s efficacy as an antipsychotic treatment, and pave the way for clinical use.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There is currently no evidence to show what regular low doses, like 30 or 40mg a day, are doing.\u2019 Photograph: Ilka & Franz/The Guardian\n\nMeanwhile, Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) has published research showing that CBD has potential as a treatment for epilepsy, particularly for children with the severe, drug-resistant form known as Dravet syndrome. The study showed that CBD reduced seizures by nearly 40% for the 120 children who took part in the trial. Prof Helen Cross, consultant in paediatric neurology at GOSH, said: \u201cThe results of this study are significant, and provide us with firm evidence of the effectiveness of cannabidiol. This drug could make a considerable difference to children who are living with Dravet syndrome and endure debilitating seizures.\u201d\n\nCBD has also been shown to be helpful for decreasing the myriad symptoms of anxiety. In 2011, scientists from Brazil conducted a trial with people with social anxiety disorder. Participants were split into two groups; one received a single 600mg dose of CBD, the other a placebo. All subjects completed a simulated public-speaking test which involved choosing a topic from a pre-selected list on which to deliver a speech, directed at a television camera as if addressing a large audience. Those who received the CBD dose before the task experienced considerably reduced anxiety levels compared with the placebo group. Preliminary evidence from another trial, completed this year by scientists at the University of Colorado, also suggests that CBD may be helpful to those who struggle with anxiety-related sleep disturbances.\n\nBut there is currently little robust evidence to support the claims CBD users make for the oils, coffees and hummus available on the high street. So, if over a million people are finding these work, are we witnessing a global placebo effect?\n\n***\n\nThe doses used in clinical trials tend to be much higher than you can buy commercially. \u201cIt\u2019s usually between 600-1500mg, either as a one-off or repeated dose,\u201d says Dr Chandni Hindocha, a research fellow with University College London\u2019s clinical psychopharmacology unit, and part of a team researching whether CBD can help treat nicotine and other addictions (the results are promising so far). Hindocha emphasises the need for more research into dosing ranges. \u201cThere are no observational studies about the lower-dose products people are taking right now. We have no idea how much they\u2019re taking and why they\u2019re taking it.\u201d\n\nIn the clinical trials Hindocha has worked on, most participants cannot differentiate between a 100mg dose of CBD and a placebo. \u201cIf most people are getting something like 50mg of CBD in a bottle, we need to think about what is going on,\u201d she says. In her opinion one-off doses of CBD in popular edibles are unlikely to have any effect. \u201cWe know that the beneficial effects of CBD usually come from building up levels of it in the body,\u201d she explains, but this is with the high trial doses. \u201cThere is currently no evidence to show what regular low doses, like 30 or 40mg a day, are doing.\u201d\n\nBut what about the vast amount of anecdotal evidence for its efficacy, particularly in helping with chronic pain? Dee Montague, a press officer from Newport, Wales, was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2018, 18 years after first going to the doctor. The impact on her life has been striking. \u201cI played roller derby for eight years but had to quit due to the pain and fatigue. I am completely exhausted by the time I get home from work and can barely function.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The majority of interested customers are female \u2013 especially those who feel that conventional pharmaceuticals aren\u2019t working for them.\u2019 Photograph: Ilka & Franz/The Guardian\n\nShe finds that CBD helps. In 2018, she began to experiment with an oil. \u201cIt took a week of regular doses to make any difference,\u201d she says, but she was pleasantly surprised. \u201cI found my cramps were far less intense. My sleep improved slightly, which made a real difference to my quality of life.\u201d She then switched to a skin balm, because \u201cthe guidance is to avoid taking CBD oils within two hours of other prescribed medication\u201d and she relies on daily medication for asthma. Montague has now been using a CBD-rich skin balm for a year, applying it to her stomach and pain spots on her legs every morning and night. The 100g jar she buys contains 1,000mg of CBD; Montague admits it is hard to know exactly how much CBD she is using each time, and does not view it as \u201ca cure or painkiller, as such\u201d. But the side-effects are nonexistent compared with opiates, she says. \u201c I feel far more in control of my pain and day-to-day life.\u201d\n\nCBD works by affecting the function of our endocannabinoid system (ECS). Made up of neurons (nerve cells), endocannabinoids (cannabis-like substances the body makes naturally) and cannabinoid receptors, the ECS is responsible for regulating the body\u2019s systems to maintain homeostasis: keeping our internal temperature, blood sugar and pH levels balanced, along with the amount of water in the body. It tells the body when to start sweating (to cool down) and when to stop. Everything from chronic pain to migraines and epileptic seizures have been linked to ECS deficiency.\n\nIt is thought that when we introduce a new cannabinoid into the body, such as CBD, it binds with these receptors and, like a molecular power-up, increases the amount of natural cannabinoids in the body. CBD has also been shown to bind with receptors for serotonin (our feelgood molecule) and GABA (the molecule that calms the nervous system), increasing the amount available to the body \u2013 offering a potential explanation for CBD\u2019s reported calming effects.\n\nI asked Hindocha whether stories such as Montague\u2019s suggest that such small doses could be having an impact? \u201cIt is very interesting,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause there is an argument that low doses of CBD could potentially affect inflammation in the body.\u201d One complicating factor is metabolism. \u201cWhen someone takes CBD oil, much of it will be broken down by the liver,\u201d Hindocha explains. \u201cWithout knowing about their metabolism, we have no idea how much CBD they\u2019re really absorbing.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBefore you can consider how much you\u2019re absorbing, you need to know how much you\u2019re taking in the first place: this year a major study by the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis found that 38% of CBD oils contain less than half the amount of CBD stated on the label. Almost half (45%) of the products contained more than 0.2% of THC (the Home Office\u2019s legal threshold) and, therefore, were technically illegal in the UK.\n\nBrowse the CBD shelf in your local health shop and you\u2019ll find a huge variation of strengths on offer; but a higher CBD content means a higher price. Holland & Barrett sells a 10ml bottle of oil by Jacob Hooy containing 5% CBD for \u00a329.99; Boots stocks 10ml bottles by Dragonfly containing 11.1% CBD for \u00a370. One of the strongest products available is by Love Hemp: a 10ml bottle with 40% CBD, for \u00a3259.99. Love Hemp suggests a maximum daily dose of 200mg; while it is thought impossible to overdose on CBD, most producers offer guidance on dosing. I notice that none of the infused products carry warnings about maximum doses, age limits, or driving.\n\nWomen want to be responsible for their own health. They want more options than those offered by traditional medicine\n\nHemp can be legally grown in the UK with a government licence, but is an incredibly small sector. It is estimated that only 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of hemp are currently cultivated in the UK\u2019s 42m acres of agricultural land. When I visited a couple of rough-and-ready CBD outlets in London which, as well as oils, sold whole hemp flowers in clear plastic bags, it made me nervous about where it came from. I was routinely assured the flowers contained less than the legal 0.2% of THC. But how can a layperson, without access to a lab and a scientist to test it, really know?\n\nThe nice man running one of my local CBD shops \u2013 a modest outfit selling oils, e-liquids, balms and bongs \u2013 offered me tea and lots of convincing chat, but agreed that dosing essentially comes down to experimenting. The smell of his shop instantly, rather thrillingly, transported me to the top of the multistorey car park in Bishop\u2019s Stortford, the locus of my teenage experimentation with marijuana. Perhaps that whiff of transgression contributes to CBD\u2019s seductiveness? Even if we know it won\u2019t get us high, it\u2019s wellness with an edge.\n\nThe Drug Store\u2019s Obel tells me that nearly all the CBD products in the UK originate from the same wholesalers; the extraction equipment is too expensive for smaller companies. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out how to do it properly \u2013 only a few people actually have the knowledge,\u201d he explains. In most cases, producers simply add the extract to their carrier oil of choice and put a new label on it.\n\nObel says the majority of his customers are women aged 40 and above. The audience for a recent in-store event, a panel discussion on the impact of stress, was 80% female. \u201cFrom what we have seen, women want to self-educate and be responsible for their own health. They want to seek more options than those offered by traditional medicine,\u201d he says. He does not believe the boom in CBD-infused high-street products like chocolate, tea and hummus will last: \u201cWe believe everyday products with CBD added will fade away. Products in which CBD is the actual active ingredient, or where CBD serves a specific purpose in supplements or cosmetics \u2013 those will most likely remain.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThat we currently have no idea of CBD\u2019s full potential is at once incredibly exciting and frustrating. Without more dedicated research, the commercial market will remain something of a wild west. Meanwhile, people will continue to inform themselves, spending their money on products with, it seems, woolly efficacy. The costs will remain prohibitive to many. Meanwhile brands will continue merrily infusing their teas and ice-creams with nominal amounts of CBD, knowing that people will pay extra for the buzz cannabis brings.\n\nI am now thinking more carefully about my own experimentation. Unless I pay close to \u00a3300 on a regular basis, for the highest strength of CBD oils commercially available \u2013 the only products that come close to what is being clinically tested \u2013 it strikes me that I may be experiencing a placebo effect. Then again, with the research in its infancy, I might not. So I will finish the bottle I have. Beyond that, the question is: how much am I willing to pay for a maybe?\n\nA touch of grass: high-street CBD, taste-tested\n\nBuddha Teas CBD Matcha Green Tea Blend (18 bags), \u00a316.99\n\nThey say \u201cOur innovative process ensures that the CBD in our tea bags actually ends up in your tea.\u201d\n\nCBD count 5mg per bag\n\nOur verdict \u201cThe taste is very subtle and the bags can rip, but I was surprised at how easily I fell (and stayed) asleep \u2013 I\u2019m normally a very light sleeper.\u201d\n\nThemptation Hemp Chocolate Spreadables CBD vanilla spread, 165g, \u00a35.05\n\nThey say \u201cMore seeds than sugar, more hemp than any other ingredient, packed with 10mg of organic CBD oil and vanilla.\u201d\n\nCBD count 10mg\n\nOur verdict \u201cThis is so delicious and wholesome-tasting, it\u2019s hard to separate that feelgood factor from any CBD effect.
