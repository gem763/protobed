Pete Sessions' climb back into Congress was already off to a rough start, with some in his own party suggesting he was carpetbagging by leaving the Dallas district he lost last fall to try to get elected in a far more rural and politically safe one.\n\nNow he may have bigger problems: a federal indictment that appears to link him to a campaign finance scheme and the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment investigation.\n\nSessions spent 22 years in Congress becoming a powerful Republican voice and the muscle behind the GOP's House takeover of 2010. But Texas' shifting demographics saw his once reliably red district become a tossup, and Sessions lost in November to Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL linebacker.\n\nFormer US Rep. Pete Sessions speak to the McLennan County Republican Party Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019, in Waco, Texas as he runs to fill the seat of Bill Flores who is stepping down (Jerry Larson/ Waco Tribune-Herald, via AP) More\n\nLast week, he announced an attempted comeback in his boyhood hometown of Waco, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Dallas, running for a seat being vacated by Rep. Bill Flores, one of six Texas GOP congressman retiring next year.\n\nWhat looked like a veteran Republican seeking greener pastures as the party increasingly loses support in cities and surrounding suburbs even in fiercely conservative Texas got further complicated Thursday, when two Florida businessmen tied to Rudy Giuliani and the Ukraine impeachment investigation were charged with federal campaign finance violations relating to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting President Donald Trump's reelection.\n\nBoth men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are Soviet-born.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas urged a congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.\n\nThe indictment does not accuse Sessions of wrongdoing or mention him by name, simply referring to the person as \"Congressman 1.\" But donations made by Parnas and Fruman match campaign finances reports for Session.\n\n\"It's awfully difficult to introduce yourself outside the district anyway and coupled with some untimely headlines ... it's tougher,\" said Joe Brettell, a Republican strategist in Houston. Of Sessions, he said: \"I think he's got a lot of talent and a lot of experience, but it may be time for him to try another way to serve the state.\"\n\nSessions said his first meeting with Parnas and Fruman was to discuss energy independence in Ukraine. He said he recalled \"a couple additional meetings\" over time but did not elaborate.\n\n\"There was no request in the meeting, and I took no action,\" Sessions said.\n\nIn May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and David Correia, his business partner who is also charged, with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office. The caption read: \"Hard at work!!\"\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 2, 2015 file photo, U.S. Rep Pete Sessions, R-Texas, opens a meeting of the House Rules Committee at the Capitol in Washington.

Scott Applewhite, File) More\n\nFlores, who has served a decade in Congress, had already slammed Sessions' planned run in an op-ed, calling it \"unacceptable that someone from outside\" the district would \"attempt to drop in and to try to elbow his way to the front of the line.\"\n\nSimilarly, GOP operatives in Washington said few in the party leadership there or in Texas were encouraging Sessions to run even before the revelations \u2014 arguing that last year's loss revealed him to be a flawed candidate.", "description": "Former Republican Rep.
