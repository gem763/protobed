He wrote: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nHis boss, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, immediately moved to distance Morey's stance from anything related to the Houston Rockets, and Morey deleted his tweet.\n\nIt didn't work. According to Yu Fu, a journalist who covers the Rockets, the country is now exacting revenge by criticizing Morey in state-run media accounts, while a company that previously offered coverage of the Rockets is suspending it until Morey offers an explanation.\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espnhttps://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nWait, what now?\n\nYeah. This thing really blew up. Which, to be clear, Yu Fu understood even when Morey first sent his tweet:\n\nThis will cause earthquake tho... https://t.co/VNw888jXs8 \u2014 Yu Fu (@YuFu_tencent) October 5, 2019\n\nNow let's get to what's actually happening right now, according to Fu.\n\nThings are getting more serious. https://t.co/Hkqs1DKxUh just called out Daryl for touching China's bottom line. This is basically the voice from government. pic.twitter.com/NmvsTtX2vm \u2014 Yu Fu (@YuFu_tencent) October 6, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Tencent, a network that provided access to Rockets games, is allowing Chinese fans who subscribed to those games to instead pick another team to follow. It appears Rockets games won't be available in China.\n\nRockets has been removed from mainstream platforms in China for now...don't know what's going to happen next, might be banned for a while. pic.twitter.com/e5Y1g777G6 \u2014 Yu Fu (@YuFu_tencent) October 6, 2019\n\nTencent is also planning on ignoring Morey for the time being.\n\nTencent Sports announced their decision that they won't cover anything related to Daryl Morey until he has reasonable explanation. pic.twitter.com/JCBYFwP2Fy \u2014 Yu Fu (@YuFu_tencent) October 6, 2019\n\nHow much of an impact will this have on the Rockets, and the NBA in China?\n\nA huge one, potentially. The Rockets are \u2014 or were? \u2014 wildly popular in China because Yao Ming played his NBA career in Houston and is the country's most recognizable star.\n\nOh, and he has a part in this as well: He's the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which announced that it will no longer cooperate with the Rockets.\n\nSPDB, a Rockets sponsor from China, announced that they will stop all marketing and promotion activities related to Rockets. pic.twitter.com/Lr7b4qvJA6 \u2014 Yu Fu (@YuFu_tencent) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association said that Daryl Morey had made \"improper remarks regarding Hong Kong\" to which it expressed its \"strong opposition.\" https://t.co/88jdGs4CDL \u2014 KHOU 11 News Houston (@KHOU) October 6, 2019\n\nThis is, of course, quite the mess. The NBA has pushed to globalize its game because there's money there. According to Forbes, the NBA's China program had a value of $4 billion in 2018. Also, that Tencent deal that brought the league $700 million was scheduled to last five years \u2014 and was signed in 2015.\n\nThere's a lot of money at stake here. That's why Fertitta, who made his fortune in restaurants and casinos and then purchased the Rockets for $2.2 billion in 2017, was so quick to jump in.\n\nSo is Morey going to lose his job over this?\n\nBefore this blowback from China, he clarified his stance and supported Morey.\n\nTilman Fertitta to ESPN: \u201cI have the best general manager in the league. Everything is fine with Daryl and me. We got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that [the organization] has no [political] position. We\u2019re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\u201d https://t.co/tS15GIOpMh \u2014 Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) October 5, 2019\n\nBut Chinese media \u2014 which, again, is largely government-controlled \u2014 has been fairly transparent about its desire to see Morey disciplined or fired.\n\nI'm still not sure how to feel about this. What are people saying about it?\n\nThere's been a strong backlash to the intermingling of sports and politics \u2014 the pendulum has swung, in many places, toward a \"Just let me watch the game in peace\" approach.\n\nBut sports is inherently political, especially when you're talking about trying to take an American league and broaden its popularity and influence in other countries. There's no escaping that.\n\nThought of this when reading about the NBA\u2019s expansion goals in India. It\u2019s not really sustainable to forge geopolitical ties with everyone and still remain apolitical. Those opportunities don\u2019t come without a cost. https://t.co/hLetkLQrb8 \u2014 Joel D. Anderson (@byjoelanderson) October 6, 2019\n\nThe NBA, under Adam Silver, has mostly done a good job of allowing its players and coaches to have a voice on social and political issues. LeBron James hosted the signing of a historic bill granting college athletes in California unprecedented rights and rallied for Hillary Clinton during the last election. Steve Kerr has railed against President Donald Trump and called for increased gun control.\n\nBut those issues divide Americans at the voting booth and on Twitter but are unlikely to have much sway over whether they patronize professional basketball.\n\nMorey, though, has offended one of the most powerful governments in the world. A government that controls what its citizens see and pay for and are allowed to support. This will be real test.\n\nDaryl Morey's \"Free HK\" tweet has put the NBA & the Rockets in an interesting bind. The league has encouraged moral stands, but this could cost them a LOT of money. If he gets disciplined, the league looks greedy & shallow. If they do nothing, they get crushed in a huge market \u2014 John Karalis \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7 (@RedsArmy_John) October 6, 2019\n\nWhat people are getting wrong about this story\n\nThat Morey said anything that was controversial to anyone other than the communist dictator he aimed it toward.\n\nThe protestors in Hong Kong are, broadly, trying to keep their city free from Chinese President Xi's brutal rule, which has included the mass incarceration of religious minorities on a scale unlike anything we've seen since the Holocaust. Please read that last clause again.\n\nHong Kong was supposed to have a high degree of autonomy when it was returned to Chinese rule, but Human Rights Watch, among others, has found that Xi's regime is already trying to limit free speech and political activism there.\n\nChina exerts vast control over its media, academia and even the internet. Its citizens are not free. Saying they should be free is not controversial.", "description": "Rockets GM Daryl Morey sent out a tweet that backed protesters in Hong Kong, infuriating China to point there are signs country won't support team.", "authors": ["Chris Korman", "Published P.M.
