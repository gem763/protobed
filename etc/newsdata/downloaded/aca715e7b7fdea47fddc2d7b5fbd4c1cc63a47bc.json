She was sentenced to life in prison in Arizona. Noah Lau, Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX \u2013 Attorneys for Jodi Arias asked the Arizona Court of Appeals on Thursday to overturn her 2008 murder conviction based on \"cumulative misconduct\" by high-profile prosecutor Juan Martinez.\n\n\"It's so pervasive and so persistent in this case,\" said Arias' attorney Cory Engle during oral arguments before a three-judge panel in Phoenix.\n\nBut Assistant Attorney General Terry Crist countered that while Martinez, the Maricopa County prosecutor, may have violated the rules \"occasionally,\" his actions don't warrant a reversal of the murder conviction.\n\nArias, who is now 39, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for murdering her sometime boyfriend Travis Alexander in his Mesa home. The 30-year-old Alexander was found dead with a bullet in his head, 27 stab wounds and a slit throat. Arias confessed to the killing, but claimed she had acted in self-defense.\n\nArias appealed her murder conviction, and Thursday's arguments before the Court of Appeals were part of that process. The judges frequently stopped the attorneys to ask pointed questions.\n\nJodi Arias appears for her trial in Maricopa County Superior court in Phoenix in 2013.

Campbell repeatedly asked Crist if Martinez had committed improper conduct in the Arias trial.\n\n\"There are instances, yes,\" he said. \"Not as many as the defense argues and none that resulted in jury prejudice.\"\n\nThursday's argument also focused on the \"carnival-like\" atmosphere surrounding the lengthy trial, which Arias' attorneys contended denied her a fair trial and an impartial jury.\n\nThe trial garnered international publicity and made the flamboyant Martinez famous. Spectators harassed witnesses online, and SWAT teams had to accompany jurors to their cars.\n\nArias\u2019 lawyers argued Martinez committed several actions of prosecutorial misconduct during the trial, and that the cumulative misconduct should be enough to overturn the conviction.\n\nBut Crist argued that Martinez\u2019s actions didn't prejudice the jury and were not a reason to reverse the conviction.\n\nJodi Arias: Murder conviction could be overturned because of prosecutor misconduct claims\n\nJudge Michael Brown questioned Crist about what an appellate court could do if a prosecutor goes into a case knowing he can do unethical things without the conviction being overturned. Crist said the court is able to file a bar charge against the prosecutor.\n\nCampbell also brought up an incident that has been reported in the media, when Martinez told Arias' defense attorney Jennifer Willmott during a sidebar at the judge\u2019s bench that if he were married to Willmott he would \u201cwant to kill myself\u201d and later telling Willmott she should go back to law school.\n\nMartinez later apologized for the comments, according to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.\n\nCampbell said Martinez in his comments \"insults\" Willmott, \"inappropriately\" calls into account her gender and then uses an expletive, which she said would get an attorney expelled from most courtrooms.\n\n\"How do you even defend that kind of conduct in this context of a death penalty case?\" Campbell asked.\n\nCrist replied, \"You don't. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate in the slightest.\"\n\nHe added, however, that the jury did not hear the comment, and ultimately the Court of Appeals is deciding whether Arias received a fair trial.\n\n\"You don\u2019t punish prosecutors by reversing convictions,\" he said.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Terry M.

He was recently transferred out of the Maricopa County Attorney's Office's capital litigation bureau and into the auto theft division, though he is still working on his remaining capital cases.\n\nMonica K. Lindstrom, an attorney who is not part of the case but has followed the case for years, said Arias' attorneys focused on the cumulative effect of Martinez's behavior while the state emphasized the overwhelming evidence of Arias' guilt.\n\n\"That's exactly what they needed to do,\" she said.\n\nIf she had to predict how the judges will eventually rule, she said, she believes they will uphold the conviction. However, \"they don't like\" what Martinez said during the trial, she said.\n\nFollow Lauren Castle on Twitter: @Lauren_Castle.
