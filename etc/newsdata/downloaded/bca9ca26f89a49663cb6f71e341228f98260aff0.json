Battersea Power Station is pictured above [File photo]\n\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2019, renewables outpaced fossil fuels on 103 of the 273 individual days, more than one-third of the days in the year so far.\n\nThe analysis, which is based on UK Business Department figures for the UK and BM Reports that cover the British grid and are adjusted to include Northern Ireland, is the latest to show the transformation of the grid.\n\nEarlier this year, Government statistics showed more than half of the UK's electricity in 2018 was generated from low-carbon sources, with renewables and nuclear reactors providing 52.6% of power generation.\n\nAnalysis by National Grid in June suggested that for the first time since the Industrial Revolution more British electricity was set to come from zero-carbon sources, which includes wind, solar, hydro and nuclear but not biomass, in 2019 than from fossil fuels.\n\nThat analysis included the mix of power coming through underwater cables known as interconnectors from other countries, such as France.\n\nRenewableUK's director of strategic communications Luke Clark said the massive growth of renewable power in the UK was 'great news not just for the environment but also for consumers', with the cost of offshore wind projects falling to an all-time low.\n\nIt is the latest milestone in the transformation of the UK's power supplies, where just a decade ago some three-quarters of generation was coming from fossil fuels. In 2010, coal, gas and oil generated more than 10 times as much electricity as renewables [File photo]\n\n'The expansion of clean power is set to accelerate in the years ahead, as our offshore wind capacity will more than treble by 2030, generating more than a third of the UK's electricity.\n\n'The public wants to see faster action to tackle climate change and meet our net zero emissions target.\n\n'If Government were to back a range of technologies - like onshore wind and marine renewables - in the same way as it is backing offshore wind, consumers and businesses would be able to fully reap the benefits of the transition to a low carbon economy.'", "description": "Renewables outpaced fossil fuels in the first quarterly period from July to September since the UK's first public power-generating station opened in 1882, climate website Carbon Brief said.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/01/19671368-0-image-a-7_1571011202428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
