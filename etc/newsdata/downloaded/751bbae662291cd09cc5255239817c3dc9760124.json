Payton was quick to deflect blame from Bridgewater, who went 17 for 30 for 165 yards during the last three-plus quarters of the game.\n\n\u201cThe penalties were significant and I thought we didn\u2019t block particularly well up front,\u201d Payton said Monday after studying video of the game. \u201cWe didn\u2019t run the ball; we averaged 2 \u00bd yards a carry. There was pressure on the quarterback pretty consistently and it\u2019s going to be hard to win if you play that way in the front.\u201d\n\nIf Bridgewater starts this week in Seattle, as expected, he\u2019ll have the benefit of practicing with the first team all week. And Bridgewater\u2019s chances of success could rise further if Seattle\u2019s pass rush is not as formidable as the Rams\u2019 unit.\n\nPayton has repeatedly expressed confidence in Bridgewater\u2019s ability and did so again on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe see it on a daily basis. We see his arm strength, his confidence, we see the leadership,\u201d Payton said. \u201cWe see all those things.\u201d\n\nBridgewater went 17-11 as a starter with his first NFL team, Minnesota, before a career-threatening knee injury in 2015 sidelined him for nearly the next two full seasons. His lone start for New Orleans was a loss, albeit a game at the end of the 2018 regular season in which a number of prominent players were being rested for the playoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, Payton has stated often he believes game plans should take into account the strengths of available players rather than asking players to take on roles that have not demonstrably suited them in the past. So one could reasonably expect Payton to tailor his offense this week to suit those in uniform, rather than trying to attack exactly how he otherwise would have with Brees.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re focused on the things you can control,\u201d Payton said in regards to guiding his team through the adversity of the past weekend. \u201cThis is where you lean on leadership and you get ready to have a good week of practice. It\u2019s kind of the nature of our league sometimes. You come in on a Monday, you have a handful of things you\u2019re having to address, and that\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe defensive front. Along with having defensive tackle David Onyemata back from a one-game suspension, the Saints\u2019 defense simply played better up front against the Rams than in Week 1 against Houston. New Orleans sacked Jared Goff three times and also made four tackles for loss. That went with end Trey Hendrickson\u2019s forced fumble that fellow end Cam Jordan recovered and appeared to return for a touchdown - only to have his return negated because of a premature whistle blown by an official who mistakenly thought the loose ball was an incomplete pass.\n\n\u201cWe played real well defensively, particularly in the first half,\u201d Payton said.\n\nThe game was tied at six in the third quarter and the Saints did not fall behind for good until the latter part of that quarter, when their defense was bound to wear down because of the offense\u2019s inability to sustain drives.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line needs to bounce back after a rough showing. Bridgewater was sacked twice and constantly under duress. Several of his better completions were negated by holding penalties. The unit also was thinned by injury as starter Andrus Pete went down with an apparent ankle injury, replaced at left guard by Will Clapp.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nPunter Thomas Morstead produced on a busy day, placing three punts inside the Rams 20 and netting an average 40.8 yards on five total punts.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWhile Marshon Lattimore is unquestionably New Orleans\u2019 top defensive back, he has yet to look like a shutdown cornerback. He gave up some big catches to DeAndre Hopkins in Week, 1 and was burned by former Saints receiver Brandin Cooks in Los Angeles for a 57-yard catch and a short TD.\n\nINJURED\n\nIn addition to Brees\u2019 thumb and Peat\u2019s ankle, receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith also appeared to have a leg injury in the second half. Linebacker A.J. Klein went to the locker room in the second half. Backup receiver Keith Kirkwood was ruled out with a hamstring injury in pregame warmups. Payton declined to provide any injury updates, as he often does on Mondays.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n11 - The number of times the Saints were penalized in Los Angeles, adding up to 87 penalty yards.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Saints will try to win in Seattle for the first time since 2007 - and will have to do so without the best quarterback in franchise history, and one of the best in the history of the NFL.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saints coach Sean Payton was on vacation this summer when he found out Teddy Bridgewater's agent was spending time on the same Bahamian island.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/saints_rams_football_32084_c0-122-2928-1829_s1770x1032.jpg?698a9ce56dabf47c3e5d55c74d636962848c6ee9", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
