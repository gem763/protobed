We got a 3 per cent pay rise on an aircraft that flies 4 per cent quicker and we get paid by the flight hour, so it was actually a pay cut,' the captain said.\n\nA Jetstar spokesperson told the publication pilots have access to performance bonuses on top of their annual three per cent salary increase.\n\n'Since January, we've been in regular and constructive conversations with bargaining representatives about a new enterprise agreement. There are a number of complex areas to discuss and working through them takes time, but we are committed to do so and optimistic that we will reach an agreement,' the spokesperson said.\n\nThe captain said the quality of the meals was a big area of contention among pilots.\n\nThe airline responded by saying the meals were designed by qualified dietitians and feedback from the pilots was taken on board.\n\nJetstar pilots who fly long haul international flights are paid between $82,000 and $228,000 as a base wage, according to the publication, with the flight captains paid at the higher end of the scale.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia chief Philip Lowe recently said the massive wage gaps between workers and executives was concerning.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Jetstar for comment.", "description": "A Jetstar pilot flying internationally from Australia says the $24 million salary of Qantas boss Alan Joyce makes his 'blood boil'.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20369166-0-image-a-15_1572431642131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
