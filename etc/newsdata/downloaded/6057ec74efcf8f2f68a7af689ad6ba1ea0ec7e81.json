We all know he\u2019s not a goalscoring machine or that goal-scoring comes naturally to him.\n\n\"Why get rid of Lukaku when you\u2019ve got someone like Martial who is doing that every week.\"", "description": "Anthony Martial could return from injury for Manchester United's clash with Liverpool on Sunday", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654644.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-United-v-Cardiff-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
