Every day \u2014 every few hours, seemingly \u2014 more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.\n\nThe president\u2019s most recent violation of the rule of law \u2014 openly calling for China to interfere in our elections, as he stood on the South Lawn of the White House \u2014 is so outrageous, it\u2019s clear he considers the presidency a free pass to do whatever he wants, with no accountability\u2026\n\nIt is easy to be distracted by Trump\u2019s daily outrages \u2014 to become obsessed with them or numb to them, or to normalize behavior that Americans would not have tolerated in any of the previous presidents in the nation\u2019s history. Not me. While the House does its job on impeachment, I\u2019m going to stay focused on what matters: remaking education so every child in the country is equipped to succeed in the 21st century; getting weapons of war off the streets and ending the epidemic of gun violence; building on Obamacare so that every American has access to quality, affordable health care; taking on the climate emergency imperiling the planet; and much more. I\u2019m going to fight to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world; a champion of democracy; and the bulwark of a stable, peaceful international order.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Biden", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Joe-Biden-Trump-Wont-Destroy-Me-And-He-Wont-Destroy-My-Family"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
