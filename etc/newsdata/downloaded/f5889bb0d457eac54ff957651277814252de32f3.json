Either you live or work in the developing world, where smartphones sometimes aren\u2019t a practical option, you\u2019re the kind of person who thrives on nostalgia for a simpler time, or else you\u2019re trying to do a \u201cdigital detox,\u201d and decrease the amount of time you seem to waste staring at screens every day.\n\nIt\u2019s these latter two groups that HMD has been pitching its retro-styled feature phones at for a couple of years now. Two years ago it produced an updated version of the iconic 3310, and last year it remade the 8110, the \u201cbanana phone\u201d similar to the model used in the original Matrix movie.\n\nThe difference with this year\u2019s \u00a389.99 Nokia 2720 Flip is that, for the first time, it actually has most of the apps and services you need in a phone in 2019. Yes, you\u2019ll be accessing them on an absolutely tiny 2.8-inch display and typing into them with a basic T9 keyboard, but fundamentally you won\u2019t be cut out of your WhatsApp conversations, you won\u2019t have to be without email, and you won\u2019t even have to go without Google Maps. They\u2019re all technically here.\n\nBut the thing is, you\u2019d have to have the patience of a saint to actually use these services on a device as limited as this. Maps and emails take forever to load, and WhatsApp messages take an age to manually type out. You might not be fully cut off from the modern world, but the limited hardware these apps are running on means that, for all intents and purposes, you basically are.\n\nOur review of Nokia 2720 Flip Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff Neat design\n\nCompatible with WhatsApp and many Google apps\n\nMultiday battery life Bad Stuff Typing on a T9 keyboard is worse than you remember\n\nStruggles to multitask\n\nIt really is a feature phone\n\nIt\u2019s a little hard to review a feature phone like the Nokia 2720 Flip, because it\u2019s so obviously not trying to compete with any smartphone on the market. It\u2019s got a tiny screen with a resolution of just 240 x 320, a 2-megapixel camera (there\u2019s no selfie camera), a dual-core 1.1GHz CPU, and just 512MB of internal storage. It can connect to both 4G LTE networks and Wi-Fi, and it\u2019s got Bluetooth for connecting to your wireless headphones.\n\nSince HMD is pitching the Nokia 2720 Flip as the kind of phone you\u2019d use for a \u201cdigital detox,\u201d it seems only fair to evaluate it on these terms. In other words, can this phone do the basic things you need a communication device to do, without constantly distracting you like a smartphone?\n\nYou\u2019ll find many popular apps preinstalled on the Nokia 2720 Flip. There are Google apps like YouTube, Maps, and Assistant, and you\u2019ll also find Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp (but no Instagram, Messenger, or Spotify). On paper, its apps cover most of the functionality you\u2019d need from an everyday phone. However, just because a phone has these apps, this doesn\u2019t mean that they work the way you\u2019re used to.\n\nTake WhatsApp. The Facebook-owned messaging app isn\u2019t impossible to use on the Nokia 2720 Flip. All the WhatsApp group chats that I\u2019m a member of seemed to work just fine, and barring one occasion where someone tried to send me their live location, the app seemed to support most of the service\u2019s main functionality.\n\nBut trust me, trying to type out WhatsApp messages on a T9 keyboard is endlessly frustrating, and it affected my ability to communicate with people in ways I hadn\u2019t anticipated. Unless you\u2019re willing to spend a lot of time typing, you\u2019ll find that your messages will start to get incredibly short and blunt. Group chats with more than a couple of participants will become almost impossible to respond to once messages start coming in more quickly.\n\nUsing WhatsApp with a T9 keyboard feels like running in a race where you\u2019re the only person wearing lead boots. Everyone else is firing off messages quickly on their touchscreen keyboards, but you\u2019re struggling to get your first message sent. It was fine back in the \u201890s when everyone was in the same position, but in 2019 you risk coming off as uncommunicative, blunt, or a little rude, when your messages are as short as they\u2019ll be when typed out on this phone.\n\nYou can mitigate this issue slightly by relying on your voice rather than the T9 keyboard to send messages. Either you can send WhatsApp voice memos as you would on a regular smartphone, or else you can hold the select button, wait for the Google Assistant to activate, and then dictate a written message. This second process can take a good few seconds to complete (meaning it\u2019s not great at sending a message quickly), but the dictation accuracy was about as good as you\u2019d expect from Google Assistant. Neither are great options if you\u2019re in public and don\u2019t want to talk out loud to your phone.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story when it comes to the phone\u2019s Twitter client, or web browser, or email app, or calendar, or Google Maps app. Yes, it has these things, but these are all apps that are basically optimized for touchscreens and for processors that are an order of magnitude faster than the 2720\u2019s. You have to have a huge amount of patience to browse the web with the T9 keyboard or watch YouTube on this phone\u2019s basic dual-core processor. Using Google Maps works in a pinch, but you have to be prepared for it to take a good minute or so to go through the laboriously slow process of getting some directions.\n\nAgree to Continue: Nokia 2720 Flip Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. For the Nokia 2720, you\u2019re going to need to agree to terms and conditions for the manufacturer of the phone and the phone\u2019s operating system. HMD\u2019s global privacy policy\n\nThe KaiOS EULA In addition, there\u2019s one set of terms from Google you\u2019ll have to agree to. Google Assistant\u2019s terms of use Final tally: three mandatory agreements.\n\nIf you\u2019re prepared to put in the effort, then you can make the phone do the things you need it to do. One time I managed to use the phone to listen to an episode of a podcast, but it was only because I had the foresight to download the MP3 file onto my PC and then transfer it into the phone\u2019s internal memory. Even then, however, I lost my place in the podcast when I hopped out of the media player to respond to a WhatsApp message.\n\nSome of these limitations can be overcome by carrying more stuff around with you, like we used to. When I went away for the weekend with the Nokia 2720 Flip as my only phone, I took a Kindle, a standalone camera, and a Nintendo Switch with me. There was something nice about this. I played better games, I took nicer photos, and I didn\u2019t get distracted as much while I did some reading.\n\nBut the phone easily over-emphasizes how many apps you use on a daily basis without realizing it. This was my biggest takeaway from using the Nokia 2720 Flip. It doesn\u2019t have any authenticator apps, for example, so I had to use my smartphone to get the six-digit 2FA code to log into my Google account as I was setting up the phone. My bank doesn\u2019t produce a KaiOS version of its app, so I had to use my old phone to generate a security code to log into my online bank account. There\u2019s no password management app, and you can forget about using this phone to hail an Uber.\n\nSo a lot of the time I just had to carry my smartphone with me, or risk not having access to vital information throughout the course of a work day. I had my SIM card installed in the Nokia, meaning my smartphone didn\u2019t have internet unless I was on Wi-Fi, but I still had it with me as a backup, and honestly it was a lifesaver. One time, I was struggling to get into a company\u2019s building for a meeting because its intercom system wasn\u2019t working, and I didn\u2019t have their contact information saved in my contacts list. Without my smartphone it would have been a nightmare to find their phone number in my emails.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect for a feature phone, the Nokia 2720 Flip has longer battery life than most smartphones, although I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t expected slightly more from it. I found I had to charge the phone once every couple of days. That\u2019s a lot better than the single day you\u2019ll get out of the average smartphone, and you could probably tease more out of it if you don\u2019t set your emails to automatically sync every five minutes as I did.\n\nUsing a feature phone in 2019 ends up being a very isolating experience\n\nIf you\u2019re really looking to do a digital detox, then the Nokia 2720 Flip technically delivers on its promises. You can get by. You can spend ages painstakingly typing out your WhatsApp messages, you can slowly keep track of your emails as they come in, and you can download your favorite podcast as an MP3 file on your computer and then manually move it to the Nokia\u2019s internal memory.\n\nYou can technically do all these things, but I want to stress that the novelty of doing them on a feature phone wears thin really quickly. No amount of pleasure at being able to snap your phone shut at the end of a phone call will make up for the odd sense of isolation at not being able to participate in a group WhatsApp conversation like you used to.\n\nYou think you can put up with these limitations because the last time you were forced to do so was when everyone else was limited by exactly the same technology. But in 2019 that\u2019s no longer the case, and as much as I hate to say it, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to opt out of the smartphone era anymore once you\u2019ve embraced it, and that makes relying on a feature phone like the Nokia 2720 Flip a pretty isolating experience.\n\nPhotography by Jon Porter / The Verge", "description": "The Nokia 2720 Flip is HMD\u2019s latest retro phone.
