REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nEcuadoreans posted videos on social media of burning road blockades and standoffs between crowds and security forces in downtown Quito ahead of the first round of talks aimed at ending 11 days of unrest.\n\nThe interior minister said a group of vandals had again set fire to the comptroller\u2019s office and that some 500 people had defied police barriers in the city.\n\nThe unrest was the worst in the small South American country in more than a decade and the latest flashpoint of opposition to the International Monetary Fund in Latin America. Moreno has cast the dispute as a battle between Venezuela and other left-leaning forces and more market-friendly ideologies.\n\nNearly 60 roads in the city were closed, the municipal government said, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cBlocking roads is punishable by law and even more so during a curfew,\u201d said councilman Bernardo Abad.\n\nIndigenous protesters vowed to continue protests across the country until Moreno reinstates fuel subsidies, a sign that a potential breakthrough in the dispute announced on Saturday might fade under the government crackdown.\n\nThe first round of talks between indigenous leaders and the government was set to begin at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) in Quito, although no announcement had been made yet on who would take part or where exactly it would be held.\n\nMoreno signed a $4.2 billion deal with the IMF earlier this year, angering many of his former supporters who voted for him as the left-leaning successor of his former ally, Rafael Correa.\n\nMoreno has defended his decision last week to slash fuel subsidies as a key part of his bid to clean up the country\u2019s finances, and denies it was required by the IMF.\n\n\u2018MURDERERS!\u2019\n\nAmid widespread defiance of the curfew by ordinary citizens, the military said it had partially lifted the emergency measure in the city until 8 p.m. on Sunday (0100 GMT Monday), but stressed it would remain in place in northern parts of the city near points of unrest.\n\nThe militarization of the city has fueled criticism that the government\u2019s handling of the protests has been too heavy-handed, with human rights groups urging security forces to use restraint.\n\nAt least seven people have been killed, several hundred wounded and more than 1,000 people arrested in the unrest since it began on Oct. 3, according to the ombudsman\u2019s office, which monitors conflicts.\n\n\u201cMurderers!\u201d one woman shouted from her window in the northern district of Mariscal as helicopters droned overhead and sounds resembling shots and explosions were heard.\n\nNearly all outgoing flights from the city were canceled on Saturday and Sunday. The airport said it was feeding stranded travelers snacks and beverages as surrounding areas were restricted.\n\n\u201cWe made our reservations and two days after we had everything booked, this problem exploded,\u201d said Rodrigo Gomez, a Chilean tourist who ventured out of his hotel for food despite the crackdown. Gomez said he and his family had hoped to see the highland city\u2019s famed lookout point \u201cel Panecillo,\u201d considered a pre-Colombian sun temple.\n\nMoreno has blamed the unrest on \u201cdark forces\u201d linked to Correa, now a fierce critic of the government who has been churning out videos showing police attacking people.\n\nAs evidence, Moreno\u2019s government has pointed to repeated attacks on the comptroller\u2019s office, where documents related to an investigation into the misuse of funds under Correa are stored.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nCorrea denies the charges and has called Moreno a sellout for turning to the right after being elected on a leftist platform.\n\nBut Conaie, an umbrella group for indigenous peoples across Ecuador and the chief organizer of anti-austerity protests, has slammed Correa as an \u201cshameless opportunist.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrea\u2019s movement criminalized and killed our people for 10 years,\u201d Conaie said on Twitter. \u201cToday he wants to take advantage of our platform for struggle.\u201d", "description": "Armored military vehicles patrolled the streets of Ecuador's capital, Quito, on Sunday after police and protesters clashed and many residents defied a curfew imposed by President Lenin Moreno in a bid to quell unrest triggered by fuel subsidy cuts.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440484109&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0NF", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
