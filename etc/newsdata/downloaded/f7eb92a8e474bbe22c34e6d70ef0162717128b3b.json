But the idea of being financially independent made him anxious. Jordan felt he would not only be leaving a job, but the identity of a doctor that he worked so hard to build.\n\n\u201cI knew I was getting tired of it, but it was never a reality to stop being a physician and start being something else,\u201d said Jordan, who prefers to be called by his alias Doc G and blogs at DiverseFi. Because he never envisioned a world where he wasn\u2019t a physician, the option of quitting work made him \u201cscared, worried and anxious.\u201d\n\nSee: Anyone with disposable income can retire early, this filmmaker says\n\nHaving enough money in the bank and the potential to never work an office job again excites many people on the journey to FIRE, but they often overlook the possible downsides.\n\nTo combat these feelings, Jordan chose to slowly transition out of his scrubs and into the field of public speaking, instead of giving up his practice all at once.\n\nFIRE has been gaining a lot of traction on social media. From Reddit threads to Facebook groups, the community of individuals scouring the internet for saving hacks, investing tips and simple calculations to retire well before they hit 65 has grown considerably. Some people cut out all the nonnecessities from their budgets, downsize their homes and work extra jobs to save enough. Others pick up investment books and read through personal finance bloggers\u2019 posts looking for the right figure before they call it quits.\n\nFIRE bloggers write about the challenges and trade-offs associated with pursuing financial independence \u2014 the skipped happy hours, the rice and beans in lieu of take-out dinners and delaying a vacation or two \u2014 but not everyone opens up as quickly about the impact on one\u2019s mental health, before or after achieving it.\n\nAnxiety and self-doubt\n\nIn his blog MadFientist, Brandon talks about how he grappled with feelings of self-doubt and apprehension in the year before he hit financial independence. He worried about whether quitting a great-paying job was the right segue to his other life goals.\n\n\u201cI always assumed after \u2018FI\u2019 [financial independence] I would become an entrepreneur,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cBut to be honest, most of the business ideas I had just weren\u2019t appealing to me after \u2018FI\u2019 anymore because money wasn\u2019t a motivating factor.\u201d\n\nAnxiety, one of the lesser-known aspects of FIRE, plays a prominent role in this movement. So, while retiring early with hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) saved sounds great, it\u2019s common for anxiety to creep in when you don\u2019t have too many people retiring around you, said Brad Klontz, author of \u201cMind Over Money\u201d and co-founder of the Financial Psychology Institute. \u201cIn some ways, retiring at a standard age is easier.\u201d\n\nRetirement at any age can shake a person up emotionally. Depression and binge drinking is common, as is loneliness and deteriorating health. Getting psychologically ready to shed the identity you have built over the years can be unnerving.\n\nWith FIRE, you take that emotional vulnerability and turn it up a notch. Going against the classic tide of life can add in a lot more worry: concerns about running out of money, doubts of making the right choices and fears of no longer being useful to the world. Not to mention the \u201cI-told-you-so\u2019s\u201d from unsupportive friends and family members if your plan fails.\n\nRead: How to deal with the haters who don\u2019t support your early-retirement dreams\n\nTanja Hester, an early retiree who achieved financial independence a little over a year ago (and MarketWatch contributor), said she had these thoughts on her journey. \u201cA lot of anxiety was over our savings \u2014 was it enough?\u201d Hester said. \u201cWe did act on the anxiety and made sure we saved, as some people would say, more than what we needed.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This couple is one year away from having enough money to retire early \u2014 here\u2019s what they did\n\nApart from the degree of emotional vulnerability, Hester, who is the author of the Our Next Life blog about early retirement and the book \u201cWork Optional,\u201d pointed out another key differentiator between the early retirement and retiring at a traditional age.\n\n\u201cMental health and sense of loss are similar but traditional retirement comes with benefits such as Social Security and Medicare!\u201d\n\nYour health over financial security\n\nKlontz says FIRE followers often fall into an existential crisis by focusing more on financial security instead of planning what their lives will look like when they have financial independence. \u201cPart of what you need to think about is what psychological needs are being met at work.\u201d\n\nHis one advice for FIRE pursuants is to start early thinking about ways to replace that feeling of belonging and the social engagement they find at work.\n\nJordan and Brandon wrestled with their own unique fears and anxiety, but both swear by one rescue tactic \u2014 dropping money as a factor. \u201cWe have to start looking at what our true identity and purpose are and what type of connections in the world are important to us,\u201d said Jordan.\n\nThink big picture\n\nWhile immediate gratification after FIRE might seem fulfilling, it is short-lived. Passion and purpose are the main drivers of enjoyment once the long vacation plans are accomplished.\n\nKlontz believes in going long and creating a detailed vision after accomplishing FIRE. \u201cThink about year 5,10, 25,\u201d said Klontz. \u201cEveryone has a list for the six months, very few people have a plan for what they are going to do after their vacation.\u201d\n\nAlso see: FIRE isn\u2019t the only path to a happy retirement\n\nFind your identity through discipline\n\nWhile FIRE might seem like a journey toward a life of no restraint, Brandon who achieved financial independence in 2014 says following a routine and being disciplined makes him feel like he\u2019s making progress.\n\nBart Brewer, a financial adviser, believes in the same philosophy to prevent yourself from being a victim of restlessness after FIRE. \u201cPeople who retire early typically have been focused and disciplined to be able to get there,\u201d said Brewer. \u201cThat same focus and discipline will be required afterward \u2014 especially if one is considering serving a purpose greater than themselves\u201d", "description": "The FIRE movement focuses on finances, but not so much on emotional well-being", "authors": ["Karishma Vanjani"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP150_hiking_ZG_20190809114555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
