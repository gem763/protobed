Some users have reported a new \u201cthemes\u201d option in the Gmail app settings that includes a dark mode setting. Here\u2019s how to check if Gmail\u2019s new dark mode is available for you:\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nOpen the Gmail Android app. Tap the three stacked lines \u201chamburger\u201d icon. Tap \u201cgeneral settings.\u201d Look for the \u201ctheme\u201d header. If you have the setting, tap it to select between Light or Dark themes, or \u201cSystem default\u201d to have the app follow your current OS-level theme settings.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to Gmail\u2019s dark mode, you can try updating your Gmail app through the Google Play Store. Dark mode is available in version 2019.08.18.267 of the app or higher if you\u2019re running Android 10, but the feature seems to be rolling out unevenly and may not yet be available for everyone.\n\nThere are ways to manually force Gmail\u2019s dark theme option to appear, but those require rooting your phone. Unless you really need a dark mode right this minute, it\u2019s simpler to just wait for the update to hit your device.", "description": "Despite teasing expanded dark mode support ahead of Android 10's release, many users who installed the update noted that several Google apps still lack dark themes, including its Gmail app. However, it looks as if those missing dark theme options are finally starting to appear....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/meehzkdcujns35zkfmqk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
