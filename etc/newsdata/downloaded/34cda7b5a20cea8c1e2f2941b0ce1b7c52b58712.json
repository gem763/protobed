Markets are moving higher", "language": "en", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Global stocks are mostly on the rise after the United States and China took small steps toward cooling trade tensions between each other.\n\nChina announced Wednesday that it would waive tariffs on some US goods. US President Donald Trump followed with plans of his own to push back new tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks.\n\nUS market futures also climbed.futures gained 115 points after hours, or 0.4%.futures were up 0.4% whilefutures increased 0.6%.\n\nTrump declared the US tariff delays as a sign of \"good will\" toward China. He said that an increase of tariffs from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of goods will be pushed from October 1 \u2014 the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China \u2014 to October 15.\n\nThe exemptions announced by China also indicate an \"olive branch\" that suggests the country's willingness to end or at least de-escalate tensions between the two sides, said Stephen Innes, a market strategist for Asia Pacific at AxiTrader.\n\nBut weak economic data from both countries is likely fueling a desire to reach some sort of agreement, according to Innes and other analysts. American manufacturing, for example, shrank for the first time in three years this summer.\n\nThat sector is \"absolutely the chunk of the economy the president most wants to safeguard,\" Innes wrote in a research note.\n\nTrade data out of China , meanwhile, has indicated that soft global demand and tariffs are weighing on the country's economy.\n\nHu Xijin, the editor of the Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times, told Bloomberg on Wednesday not to think of China's exemptions as a \"concession\" from the country. But the Chinese government's announcement still \"reflects the growing impact of the tariffs upon the wider Chinese economy,\" wrote Jingyi Pan, a strategist for IG Group, in a research note.\n\nOthers have also pointed out that China's exemptions \u2014 which start September 17 and continue for a year \u2014 so far don't include major goods that are subject to tariffs, like soybeans or meat. They instead include products like shrimp, fish meal and cancer treatment drugs.\n\n\"Chinese tariffs that really matter are the ones on US agricultural and manufacturing goods, produced mainly in states with strong support for Donald Trump,\" said Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, on Wednesday. \"We just don't see China willing to negotiate on them before the race for US presidential elections really kicks off.\"\n\nThe United States and China are expected to meet again face-to-face in Washington in the coming weeks for another round of trade negotiations . Experts have previously noted that a genuine compromise will be difficult, since the United States wants China to implement sweeping structural changes that would mean a significant reduction in the state's role in the economy. China is reluctant to make reforms that would overturn its fundamental state-driven development model.\n\nOther market moves in Asia\n\nHang Seng Index HSI Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing HKXCF Hong Kong'swas the only loser among major Asian indexes Thursday.
