The massive plane\u2014constructed entirely out of birchwood due to wartime restrictions on metals\u2014is still the world\u2019s largest boat ever built.\n\nThe vessel was the brainchild of the daring American inventor, aviation tycoon, and Hollywood film director Howard Hughes, one of the most enigmatic personalities of the 20th century. Hughes\u2019 gargantuan flying ship flew only once for one minute on Nov. 2, 1947, and he was reportedly irked by the spruce misnomer.\n\nBrothers Nick and Giles English launched Bremont in 2002 with a heavy emphasis on pilot watches. The brothers are the sons of an ex-RAF pilot with a PhD in aeronautical engineering, so they grew up learning about aviation history and flying vintage aircraft. They even named their brand after an amiable French farmer in whose field they made an emergency landing in a 1930s bi-plane.\n\n\u201cGiles and I have been fascinated by the story of the H-4 Hercules since childhood,\u201d Nick English said in a news release. \u201cIt paved the way for the large aircraft we see today, and did it with style, panache, and just a dash of Hollywood.\u201d\n\nThe H-4 Hercules, better know as the \"Spruce Goose.\" Bremont\n\nLimited to 450 pieces, the 43mm H-4 Hercules chronometer remarkably incorporates original materials from the milestone plane, courtesy of the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, where the aircraft is exhibited today.\n\nVisible through the sapphire crystal case back, the watch\u2019s slate-gray-colored automatic movement is fitted with a unique propeller-shaped tungsten winding rotor with blades incorporating pieces of the plane\u2019s birchwood veneer, which became available during the museum\u2019s H-4 restoration. Bremont also infused the watch\u2019s bridle leather packaging with original aileron fabric from the aircraft\u2019s control panels.\n\nThe BWC/02 movement is based on Bremont\u2019s automatic BWC/01 calibre built in partnership with the respected movement house, La Joux Perret. It features a GMT function for tracking multiple time zones, a smaller non-hacking seconds hand at 9 o\u2019clock, and a date window at 6 o\u2019clock.\n\nBremont is producing 300 pieces in stainless steel (US$11,895), 75 in rose gold (US$22,495), and 75 in platinum (US$30,995). Each metal will be combined with a brown or matte black dial appointed with polished applied indexes and a 24-hour dial ring around the perimeter.\n\n\u201cThe Hughes H-4 is arguably one of the most important aircraft ever to have flown, in terms of its innovations in construction and control systems\u2014a huge contribution to aviation development and history,\u201d English says.\n\nA percentage of proceeds are going to the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum for preserving the aircraft.", "description": "Inspired by Howard Hughes\u2019 \u201cSpruce Goose,\u201d the timepiece is limited to 450 pieces", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115867/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
