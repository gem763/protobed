Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) anymore.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Verge published a transcript and audio from a recent Q&A Zuckerberg held with interns where he said Facebook would fight Warren\u2019s campaign promise to break up large tech companies, among other things. Zuckerberg attempted to own the leak, posting a link to the story on his Facebook page and reaffirming his remarks in the public Thursday meeting.\n\n\u201cSure, I may have said it in more of an unfiltered way, but fundamentally, we believe in everything that was in there,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I do such a bad job at interviews, it\u2019s like \u2018What do we have to lose?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said Thursday that Facebook would likely engage a Warren administration in a lawsuit should it try to divide the company and that he believed Facebook would win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to antagonize her further,\u201d he said.\n\nHe attempted to address questions of keeping company bias against Warren out of the social network as she campaigned, saying the back-and-forth with her was a chance to connect\u2014\u201ca moment of empathy,\u201d he called it\u2014with people who believe Facebook might be biased against them.\n\nAnother employee asked Zuckerberg how he weighs the pros and cons of end-to-end message encryption, the highly regarded security measure that obscures content until it reaches its intended recipient. Earlier in the day, Facebook said it would not abandon plans to encrypt messages sent via Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct in response to a letter from Attorney General William Barr requesting law enforcement access to messages on the company\u2019s apps. The New York Times reported that Facebook Messenger was one of the favored platforms for pedophiles to exchange images and videos of child exploitation but that Facebook was one of the best partners to law enforcement aimed at preventing and prosecuting the crimes.\n\nZuckerberg said the team working to identify child predators would be able to pick them out by looking at \u201cpatterns of behavior\u201d rather than their messages and that he still believed encrypting the messaging apps would be worth the tradeoffs.\n\n\"The top messaging app in the united states is iMessage. It\u2019s end-to-end encrypted. People want that,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother employee, seemingly half-joking, asked Zuckerberg to respond to Bernie Sanders\u2019 assertion that \u201cBillionaires should not exist.\u201d The CEO\u2019s net worth is roughly $67 billion.\n\n\u201cNo one deserves to have that much money,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some level it\u2019s not fair, but it may be optimal, or better than the alternative, which is the government chooses everything.\u201d He cited the foundation he started with his wife, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and its funding for scientific research.", "description": "\u201cAt this point, I do such a bad job at interviews, it\u2019s like \u2018What do we have to lose?\u2019\u201d the Facebook CEO quipped.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_237/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570155753/GettyImages-1169608921_ivarzg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
