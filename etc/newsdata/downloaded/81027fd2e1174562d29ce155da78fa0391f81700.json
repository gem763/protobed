party because of the potential impact on Democratic candidates in the 2020 elections.\n\nReports surfaced last week that Mr Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner in those elections.\n\nThe question for Ms Pelosi throughout last weekend was whether the allegations warranted a dramatic shift.\n\nWhile she thought things over, Ms Pelosi was moving around.\n\nShe did not go home to California, but spoke at NPR journalist Cokie Roberts\u2019 funeral on Saturday in Washington, flew to South Carolina on Sunday, returned to Washington late Sunday night and made a quick trip to New York on Monday.\n\nThe speaker spoke by conference call on Monday with seven freshman members of the House who were about to post an opinion piece in the Washington Post saying the allegations against Mr Trump, if true, were impeachable offences.\n\nThe group was giving Mr Pelosi a \u201cheads up\u201d that they were going to be posting the piece that evening. She praised them for making national security the central part of their argument.\n\nWhen she made her announcement, Ms Pelosi stood in front of a line of US flags in her office, saying the US president's actions undermined national security and violated the US Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
