The creature, which lived about 96 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, boasted a 13-foot wingspan, a bony crest at the tip of its upper and lower jaws and spike-shaped teeth perfect for a diet of fish.\n\nFerrodraco means \u201ciron dragon,\u201d an apt name, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018iron dragon\u2019 seemed fitting, given that this animal would have been one of the top predators of the skies during the Cretaceous. Moreover, without the preservation of the bones in ironstone, it\u2019s unlikely that we would have recovered this fossil material in the first place,\u201d said paleontologist Adele Pentland of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Natural History Museum, a PhD candidate at Swinburne University of Technology.\n\nPterosaurs, the biggest of which had a 35-foot wingspan, lived worldwide alongside the dinosaurs during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Both were extinct after an asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago.\n\n\u201cPterosaurs are quite rare in the fossil record, and are often incomplete, as their bones are hollow and the cortical bone is quite thin,\u201d said Pentland, lead author of the research published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nUntil now, most of Australia\u2019s pterosaur remains have been isolated and fragmentary fossils. For Ferrodraco, the researchers discovered a partial skull, five cervical vertebrae, elements from both wings and 40 isolated teeth and tooth fragments. While it amounted to roughly 10 percent of its skeleton, it was enough to reveal a lot about the animal.\n\n\u201cThis pterosaur gives us a better understanding of the pterosaurs that lived in Australia during the mid-Cretaceous,\u201d Pentland said.\n\nFerrodraco apparently lived in a forested environment around lake and river systems alongside the meat-eating dinosaur Australovenator and long-necked, four-legged plant-eaters Savannasaurus and Diamantinasaurus, as well as crocodile relatives and other animals.\n\nPentland said based on an analysis of the fossil it was more closely related to pterosaurs from England than from South America, even though dinosaurs and other land vertebrates at the time in Australia generally demonstrated close ties to South American lineages.", "description": "", "authors": ["Will Dunham", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
