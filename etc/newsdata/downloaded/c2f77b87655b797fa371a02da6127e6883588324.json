It follows five women from different cultures fighting back against the societal structures that restrict female sexual pleasure and autonomy. In spite of the vast dissimilarities in their backgrounds, the women are all activists in their own right, and their experiences are connected by the shared injustice of being raised to feel as though their bodies do not belong to them.\n\nWe are first introduced to Deborah Feldman, who was raised in the Orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She describes the seemingly insurmountable schism between her neighborhood and the rest of New York City. \u201cEven though there was no wall around my community,\u201d she says, \u201cthere was a very effective invisible barrier.\u201d Though the Manhattan skyline beckoned from just across the river, \u201cit could have been another planet.\u201d\n\nOnly when Feldman was 17 and preparing for her arranged marriage did her elders offer a euphemistic explanation of sex and its sole purpose: reproduction. Her first sexual experience with her husband was painful, unenjoyable, and resulted in her immediate pregnancy. \u201cOnce I grew into my full feminine power as a woman,\u201d she explains, \u201cthat\u2019s when I became completely crushed.\u201d Shortly after giving birth to her son Isaac, she made the decision to leave the Hasidic community so her son would not be raised the same way she was.\n\nVithika Yadav, the founder of the Love Matters India sex education platform, is next, speaking bluntly about living in a male-dominated society in which \u201chaving a girl child is a liability\u201d and \u201chonor killing is still very common.\u201d Yadav founded Love Matters to break down the taboo surrounding female sexuality and to provide an online space for Indian people to engage in candid discourse about healthy love, sex, and relationships. In touchingly mundane scenes of domestic life with her husband, a pilot, and their young son clad in Spider-Man pajamas, one understands the weight of Yadav\u2019s assertion that she is \u201cvery proud of marrying the person that I wanted to marry.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the film\u2019s 96 minutes, we also meet Rokudenashiko, a Japanese artist who accessorizes her copper-colored bob with large bows and makes sculptural art from molds of her own vagina; Doris Wagner, a soft-spoken nun who cautiously divulges her heartbreaking story of being raped by a priest, shattering her faith and driving her to leave the Catholic Church; and Leyla Hussein, an advocate for the abolition of female genital mutilation (FGM).\n\nEach woman, all invaluable in terms of the work they are doing, frame their stories in different ways. Hussein, a psychotherapist by day and herself a survivor of FGM, is assertive and confident as she speaks before crowds. She defines the common practice as sexual assault of a child and reminds people that it is a global problem affecting not just girls on the African continent, but the Somali-Muslim diaspora worldwide. Rokudenashiko\u2019s story provides some relief in its light-heartedness, particularly when she gleefully sets sail in a canoe made from a 3D-printed model of her genitalia. But even that relief is short-lived, and she is arrested for obscenity in a raid on her home conducted by 10 police officers, prompting her to realize \u201chow many people felt such hatred towards vaginas.\u201d\n\nAnd then, just when the weight of centuries of oppression and inequality begins to feel unbearable, a sense of hope creeps up on you in a way that, crucially, does not undermine the urgency of the film\u2019s call for change.\n\nOne such turning point is a scene in which Feldman drives through Williamsburg with Isaac peering out the window in the backseat, enthralled and asking the kinds of honest questions characteristic of small children. \u201cI don\u2019t like to come here, you know, Isaac,\u201d she tells him, \u201cbecause it reminds me that I used to feel really stuck.\u201d Not anymore. She asks him if he wants to move back there, and without skipping a beat, the young boy replies emphatically, \u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of #Female Pleasure, Doris Wagner\u2019s grave, bespectacled face breaks into a warm smile as she allows herself to appreciate her life after the church, married with a child and pursuing a doctorate degree. \u201cI was longing to feel my body again,\u201d she says, \u201cto listen to music, real music, which is about emotions. Love songs. It was like being born again.\u201d", "description": "A new documentary follows five female activists working in separate corners of the globe to fight back against the oppressive stigmas used to stifle female pleasure.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571000767/191013-julian-femalepleasure-tease_c2nnfb", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
