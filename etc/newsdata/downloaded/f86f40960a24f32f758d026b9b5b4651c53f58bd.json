REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nSchiff had previously shied away from calling for impeachment, but his comments on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d indicate his stance has shifted.\n\n\u201cIf the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader to do something illicit, to provide dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that conduct represents,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSchiff told CNN on July 25 that the only way Trump would leave office is to be \u201cvoted out,\u201d while encouraging Democrats to make sure voters go to the polls in 2020.\n\nOther Democrats, including presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have called for Democratic leadership to pursue impeachment immediately.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is at the center of an escalating battle in Washington. The Trump administration has refused to give Congress a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the call, in which Trump reportedly pressured Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations about Biden.\n\nTrump told reporters on Sunday he had a great call with Zelensky and that he would have no problem with his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, testifying before Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt Biden, but he did a very dishonest thing,\u201d Trump said Sunday morning as he left Washington for a rally in Houston.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said that Biden should be investigated if evidence shows he improperly intervened to protect his son from an investigation in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt. I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Congress needs to hear from the whistleblower. If the allegations are sustained, there would be an \u201copen-and-shut\u201d case for impeachment, he said.\n\nImpeachment proceedings in Congress can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need support from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans who control the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance of us persuading Senate Republicans in an impeachment trial,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey have shown their willingness to carry the president\u2019s baggage, no matter how soiled its contents.\u201d Before Congressional Democrats move for impeachment, they need to \u201cpersuade the public that this is the right thing to do,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and other news outlets on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice president, threatened to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nTrump, reports said, urged Zelensky, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with his personal lawyer, Giuliani, who has promoted the allegations against Biden and his son and acknowledged that he pressed for a Ukrainian investigation.", "description": "If an investigation shows that U.S. President Donald Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, then impeachment would be the only option, U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432651435&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0IQ", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
