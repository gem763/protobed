Everybody got up. He got up a little slow and he didn\u2019t get back up,\u201d Welch\u2019s mother, Marcia Nelson, told the outlet.\n\nWelch was taken to Bayfront Hospital, where doctors discovered he had a pre-existing condition that was previously unknown to the family. The rare disease, an arteriovenous malformation, causes blood vessels in the brain to form abnormally, leaving them vulnerable to tears that can cause bleeding in the brain or spine, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyone could have done to prevent this. The doctors told me this would have happened whether he was on the field playing or not,\u201d Nelson told WFTS.\n\n\u201cIt was something he couldn\u2019t control, nobody could control, so it\u2019s keeping me calm and understanding \u2026 what happened,\u201d she added to Bay News 9. \u201cTragedy happened, but it was a cause that I couldn\u2019t control, so maybe that\u2019s more why I\u2019m a little calmer.\u201d\n\nRELATED: College Football Star Convulses During Game, Collapses on the Field\n\nOn Sunday, Welch\u2019s teammates signed his jersey, which was framed and then carried onto the field before one of their games. As of Sunday, Welch was still in the ICU and surrounded by friends and family.\n\n\u201cI was a lucky man, not an unlucky man, because I got to be with Jacquez,\u201d Northeast High Coach Jeremy Frioud said, according to Bay News. \u201cI got to impact Jacquez and Jacquez got to impact me. So that\u2019s how the football team and how we\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Louisville Cardinals Cheerleader\u2019s Nose Broken by Football in Bad Pass from Notre Dame Quarterback\n\nAccording to WFTS, Welch held a 4.0 GPA and recently received a scholarship to attend college.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of him. I just made sure I told him that every time I\u2019d see him. I love you. I\u2019m just so proud of you. He was the perfect son,\u201d his father, Tory Larkins, told Bay News.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: 20-Year-Old Tennessee College Student Collapses and Dies During Charity Boxing Match\n\nA GoFundMe for Welch\u2019s family has been set up.\n\nWelch\u2019s hospitalization comes the same week as another high school football player, Deshaud Williams of Texas, was hospitalized after experiencing shortness of breath while running with his brother. He later died and a cause of death has not been determined, according to Today.", "description": "High School Football Player Placed on Life Support", "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z92QibadRcHZpyJBKTxSzA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/e188abf837666fcb34fd0b34f50646b3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
