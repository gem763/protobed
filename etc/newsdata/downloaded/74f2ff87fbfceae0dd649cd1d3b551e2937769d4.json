The gunman later told police he was targeting Mexicans.\n\nCampaigns are now adapting their messages, with Democrats focusing on the link between mass shootings and white nationalism, and President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE's rhetoric.\n\n\"We need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism. It poses a threat to Black and Latinx families and to the entire country. Too often, guns are used to provoke fear in communities of color,\" said Sen.

Folks, it\u2019s long past time that we in fact call it out for what it is: This is white nationalism. This is white supremacy. This is about hate. This is about what happened in a border community,\" added Biden.\n\nMaking that link has resonated with Hispanic voters, who increasingly express fear they could be the next victims of a hate-fueled shooting.\n\nAccording to last month\u2019s Univision poll, 86 percent of Hispanics are worried about another mass shooting motivated by racial or ethnic hatred.\n\nDemocrats blame Trump's rhetoric and the wide availability of military-style firearms.\n\n\"This is an administration that wants the American public to fear immigrants and to hate immigrants,\" said Rep. Veronica Escobar Veronica EscobarHispanic voters push campaigns to address gun violence Trump impeachment calls snowball, putting pressure on Pelosi This week: Congress races to prevent shutdown as recess looms MORE (D-Texas), who represents El Paso, where 22 people died in the Walmart shooting.\n\n\"And ultimately, that leads to violence \u2014 it fuels violence \u2014 and so the fear that Latinos are feeling is completely well-founded. And after El Paso we saw that our reality is today is very different from what our reality was a few years ago,\" she added.\n\nDaniel C. Bucheli, a spokesman for Trump's reelection campaign, said the president \"enjoys broad support from minority communities, including Latinos and first-time voters, and this backing continues to grow daily.\"\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has delivered on his promises of more jobs, a growing economy, secure borders and protecting all Americans' constitutional rights,\u201d said Bucheli. \u201cNext year\u2019s election will be a stark contrast between a proven record of success or big government socialist agenda pushed by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nSome of the deadliest shootings have targeted Hispanic communities.\n\nIn 2016, a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. A majority of the victims were of Puerto Rican descent.\n\nThat shooting, said Rep. Darren Soto Darren Michael SotoHispanic voters push campaigns to address gun violence Ginsburg, Patrick Dempsey among honorees at Congressional Families Cancer Prevention Program Two years after Maria, Puerto Rico awaits disaster funds MORE (D-Fla.), reframed the gun debate in Central Florida, but there was scant legislative action on the matter until two years later after a gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\"It absolutely fundamentally changed after both, Pulse nightclub and Parkland. I will tell you though, there was greater legislative change after Parkland,\" said Soto, the first lawmaker of Puerto Rican origin elected to Congress from Florida.\n\n\"And unfortunately, that has to do a lot with the messengers. They went after an upper middle-class, predominantly Anglo school. And I think that resonated pretty strongly with Republican legislators here in Florida,\" he added.\n\nBut Democrats disagree on how far to go on gun control.\n\nAfter the El Paso shooting, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke Beto O'RourkePoll: Biden holds 24-point lead over Democratic field among black voters Hispanic voters push campaigns to address gun violence O'Rourke hits Buttigieg over not supporting mandatory gun buybacks: 'It's time to lead' MORE (D-Texas), a Democratic presidential candidate who previously held Escobar's seat, lunged far to the left by proposing a compulsory buyback of military-style rifles.\n\nEscobar stopped short of supporting O'Rourke's proposal, but lauded her longtime political ally for expanding the conversation on guns.\n\n\"I think it's important to have these debates, I really do. And we also have to remember that whoever the nominee is, and whatever position they might have, they still have to work with a Congress that is very diverse, even in our own party,\" said Escobar.\n\nSixteen districts represented by Congressional Hispanic Caucus members \u2014 almost half of the group\u2019s 38-strong membership \u2014 have experienced at least one mass shooting this year. Those shootings were among the 158 House districts, out of 435, impacted this year alone, according to a recent analysis by The Hill.\n\nSoto said voters in his district are more open to the idea of military-style weapons bans, but polls show disparities among Hispanic groups when it comes to guns.\n\nTwenty-three percent of Cuban Americans surveyed last month said their top issue was guns and shootings, compared with 13 percent among all Hispanic voters. Fourteen percent of Hispanics who have voted for the GOP said it was their top issue.\n\nBut when it comes to discussing mass shootings and assault weapons, there's more unity than disagreement, Soto argued.\n\n\"In the Democratic primary among our voters, there's definitely a strong desire to ban assault weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the history of our nation, these things ebb and flow.\u201d\n\n\"People understand now that there weren't these mass shootings that happened back then ... and the number of deaths tripled after the assault weapons ban lapsed.\"", "description": "Hispanics have become increasingly worried about gun violence and mass shootings in recent months, making the issue a top campaign priority for more voters at a time when Latino communities have been targeted in some of the nation\u2019s most high-prof", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gunviolence_elpaso_memorial_081519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
