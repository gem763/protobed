Bill Weld, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois drew a sparse crowd Saturday at the Politicon conference in Nashville. The event attracted several hundred people in a room with more than 2,000 seats.\n\nThe three disagreed on the impeachment inquiry. Weld and Walsh expressed support for impeachment. Sanford said a censure could be a better option, contending that a likely acquittal in the GOP-led Senate could benefit Trump politically.\n\nEach is opposing decisions by several states to cancel 2020 GOP presidential primaries, a move that's not unusual for the party of the White House incumbent seeking reelection.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
