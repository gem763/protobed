Forty percent of Americans oppose the action, the survey found. However, the New York Post released an analysis on Saturday, which suggested that the results do not accurately represent the public\u2019s purported support of the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.\n\n\u201cThe Fox Impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect,\u201d Trump declared on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis was announced on Friday. Despite this, the Corrupt New York Times used this poll in one of its stories, no mention of the correction which they knew about full well!\u201d Trump added:\n\n\u2026.of the correction which they knew about full well! \u201cFox News Pollster Braun Research Misrepresented Impeachment Poll: Analysis\u201d @NYPost \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Post\u2019s analysis found that Braun Research, which conducted the poll for Fox News, misrepresented the public\u2019s opinions on impeachment. While Braun Research said Democrats made up 48 percent of respondents, \u201cthe actual breakdown of party affiliation is 31% Democrat, 29% Republican and 38% independent, according to Gallup,\u201d the Post reported.\n\n\u201cA poll weighted for party affiliation would have concluded that 44.9% favored impeachment and 44.4% opposed it,\u201d the Post concluded.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,\u201d Trump tweeted in part:\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nPublic Opinion Strategies conducted an internal poll in key 2020 congressional districts on October 1-3, 2019 for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and Team McCarthy. The internal poll revealed that the majority of voters in those key districts do not view Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 which serves as the Democrats\u2019 basis for the inquiry \u2013 as an impeachable offense.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe poll shows the majority, 59 percent, do not view the conversation as an impeachable offense, while 37 percent view it as impeachable. While opinions on impeachment are largely divided on party lines, the majority of independents\u2013 57 percent \u2013 do not view the conversation itself as impeachable. The survey spelled trouble for Democrats who hold seats in Trump-won districts. The vast majority \u2013 62 percent \u2013 consider the conversation between the two leaders was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Only 33 percent considered it impeachable. Furthermore, Republican candidates in Trump districts represented by Democrats hold a \u201cdouble-digit advantage\u201d over impeachment-supporting Democrats.\n\nThe poll also found that the majority of voters in Trump-won, Democrat-held districts, 54 percent, would be more willing to vote for a Republican over an impeachment-supporting Democrat.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats who represent Trump districts appear to be in a precarious position here, as their voters clearly side against impeachment and are much more willing to vote for a GOP candidate opposing impeachment than a Democrat supporting it,\u201d a memo summarizing the poll\u2019s findings concluded.", "description": "President Trump on Monday slammed the NYT for using Fox News's \"incorrect\" poll, which suggested that 51 percent support impeachment.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-Slams-NYT-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
