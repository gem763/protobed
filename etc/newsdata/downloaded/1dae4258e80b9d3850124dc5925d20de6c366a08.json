I was constantly scratching, even in places where there were no bites, and it felt like my blood was boiling inside me,\u2019 she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The doctor said that from what I\u2019ve described, it\u2019s definitely something in the bed or the upholstery \u2013 possibly bed bugs or dust mites.\u2019\n\nLisa, who regularly used Premier Inn for the last ten years, said she\u2019ll never step foot in one again after the way she\u2019s been \u2018fobbed off\u2019.\n\nA Premier Inn spokesman said: \u2018To ensure that we are proactive in matters of this nature, our housekeeping and maintenance teams are fully trained to spot the signs of bed bugs.\n\n\u2018In this instance, upon receiving the complaint our specially-trained team members examined the room and their stringent checks revealed no evidence of bed bugs.\n\n\u2018Nonetheless, in the interests of caution, the team have since engaged with external specialists to launch their own inspection of the guest\u2019s room and they have independently confirmed that there is absolutely no evidence of bed bugs in the room Mrs Adams\u2019 was allocated.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
