(AP) - The winningest season in 13 years only whetted the appetite in Sacramento.\n\nNothing short of ending the NBA\u2019s longest active playoff drought will be enough to consider the upcoming season a success for the Kings.\n\nA roster led by emerging young stars like point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox and forward Marvin Bagley III, and fortified by the addition of some key veterans in the offseason, gives first-year coach Luke Walton the most complete Kings team since the last postseason berth back in 2006 in coach Rick Adelman\u2019s final season.\n\n\u201cSome positives came from last season, especially in the summer,\u201d said Bagley, who averaged 14.9 points per game last season. \u201cBut not making the playoffs was something I thought about all summer. I just had that in the back of my mind that we still got to get to the playoffs and show everybody what we can do.\u201d\n\nThe Kings finished ninth in the Western Conference with 39 wins last season, a 12-game improvement from the previous season and the most since a 44-38 campaign in 2005-06.\n\nBut they still finished nine games out of the last playoff spot in a conference that only got tougher with Anthony Davis joining the Lakers and Kawhi Leonard and Paul George joining the Clippers.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows the Western Conference got extremely tough and it was tough before this,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot tougher. At the same time, we feel like we\u2019ve gotten better as a team. It would be a lot more disappointing to miss the playoffs.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to watch:\n\nDEVELOP A DEFENSE\n\nThe top task for Walton after arriving in Sacramento was to build a better defense than the team had last season when the Kings allowed 115.3 points per game. The Kings were good at forcing turnovers with 15.9 per game to fuel the transition game but weren\u2019t as effective in the half court. It\u2019s an issue the players recognize.\n\n\u201cLast year our problem wasn\u2019t putting the ball in the basket,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe scored with the best of them. We know what we have to get better at. It\u2019s on the defensive end.\u201d\n\nFIRE AWAY\n\nThe biggest change on the offensive end that Walton plans to implement is a heavier reliance on 3-pointers. The Kings were an efficient team from long range, ranking fourth in the league by making 37.8% of 3-pointers. But Walton wants to see them use that strategy more often, increasing from about 30 shots from long range a game to 35 this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll shoot as much as they want me to,\u201d said guard Buddy Hield, who led the team with 278 made 3s. \u201cMy confidence is high. Whenever the opportunity presents, I\u2019ll take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nEMERGING STARS\n\nThe Kings are building the team around two young potential stars in Fox and Bagley. Fox took a big leap in his second season, making big improvements in his shooting, scoring, passing and defense. He averaged 17.3 points and 7.3 assists per game, up from 11.6 and 4.4 as a rookie. Sacramento is hoping for a similar boost in year two from Bagley, who averaged 14.9 points and 7.6 rebounds per game as a rookie.\n\n\u201cWhen you work hard, are talented and have some of the gifts they have, good things happen,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what they bring to the court this year.\u201d\n\nGOING DEEP\n\nThe moves in the offseason to add veterans gives Sacramento a roster that can go 12 deep in the rotation this season. Dewayne Dedmon and Richaun Holmes add a defensive presence in the front court to take pressure off Bagley and the other young big men. Trevor Ariza gives Walton another strong defensive wing player who can also make 3s. Cory Joseph provides a proven backup up at point guard to ease the load on Fox and even play with him at times. Managing that many players could be one of Walton\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nFREQUENT FLYERS\n\nThe Kings will spend plenty of time on planes early in the season. They traveled to India in the preseason and play 18 of their first 29 games on the road. They will play nine of their 13 games in the Eastern time zone before Christmas, making getting off to a fast start challenging.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The winningest season in 13 years only whetted the appetite in Sacramento.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/suns_kings_basketball_69867_c0-100-2400-1500_s1200x700.jpg?4fe62c4baf8f15c7a1252812691534105c9546ec", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
