You looked kind of bored of the same name conquering the division for a decade, so you have different players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I believe this mixed names in the heavyweight division makes it appealing.\n\n\u2018I am definitely looking forward to the rematch, Andy Ruiz, as a champion, against Anthony Joshua.\n\n\u2018We know Anthony has lost, as anyone can lose, and now we\u2019re going to watch how he is going to manage this challenge to become champion again.\n\n\u2018I could think anything but the reality is everyone can lose a fight. But not everyone can recover.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the next challenge and I really wish to Anthony that he\u2019s going to make it.\n\nJoshua is aiming to win back four heavyweight titles from Ruiz (AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018No disrespect to Andy Ruiz, I think he\u2019s done an amazing job.\n\n\u2018But I\u2019ve always been a fan of Anthony since we fought, we\u2019ve met, since actually I was watching him win an Olympic gold medal.\n\n\u2018To both the fighters \u2013 good luck, let the strongest win. I just really hope Anthony is going to make it.\u2019", "description": "Wladimir Klitschko is hoping Anthony Joshua wins his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr on December 7.
