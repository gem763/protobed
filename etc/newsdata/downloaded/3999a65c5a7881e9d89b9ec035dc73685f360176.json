She is the second woman he is accused of murdering\n\nSmith entered an innocent plea Monday in an Anchorage courtroom in Abouchuk's death. He earlier pleaded not guilty in the death of 30-year-old Kathleen Henry, a Alaska Native woman in September\n\nSmith's alleged horrific killing streak came to light when a woman stumbled upon a lost digital memory card labeled 'Homicide at midtown Marriott' that contained harrowing footage of him murdering Kathleen Henry in September at a Marriott hotel. When he was arrested for that murder, he confessed to another killing\n\nSmith's alleged horrific killing streak came to light when a woman stumbled upon a lost digital memory card labeled 'Homicide at midtown Marriott' that contained harrowing footage of him murdering Kathleen Henry. The woman handed the memory card to police.\n\nIn the gory footage, the suspect complained to the victim, whose face was swollen and bloodied: 'My hand's getting tired.' He then stomped her throat with his right foot.\n\nThat murder is believed to have taken place in September.\n\nSmith was arrested on October 8, after he was identified by his unmistakable accent from South Africa, out of place in the far reaches of Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nDetectives recalled Smith from another investigation, but they didn't specify which.\n\nWhile in custody he confessed to the second murder. But he has pleaded not guilty to Kathleen Henry's murder and Abouchuk's killing.\n\nHe appeared agitated in court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to shooting Abouchuk dead. In the Monday hearing his bail was set at $2million.\n\nAbouchuk, a homeless mother-of-four living in Anchorage, was reported missing February. Her family last saw her in July 2018, police said.\n\nVeronica Abouchuk pictured above in 2013. Abouchuk had four children before she became homeless, a lifestyle she embraced before she was killed\n\nRena Sapp, Abouchuk's sister, pictured outside the courtroom Monday October 21 showing the 2013 image of her sister\n\nAfter telling cops where he dumped her body on a highway outside Anchorage, State Troopers recovered a skull with a bullet wound earlier this year.\n\nMonday's hearing was an emotional one and several family members of the slain woman sobbed in court and had to leave when Smith was brought in, dressed in an orange prison uniform.\n\nAfter the hearing, Abouchuk's niece, Tatauq Ruma, said she has questions for Smith.\n\n'Why did he do it?' she said.\n\nShe says her Aunt Veronica Abouchuk was a Yupik who grew up in the small community of Saint Michael, on the state's western Bering Sea coast, and later moved to Anchorage.\n\nThe last time they spoke, Abouchuk told her niece she liked being homeless.\n\n'She didn't say why. She was just happy that she was homeless and that she was OK with that,' Ruma said. 'She's just a very sweet lady. She loved her kids. She loved everyone. I really miss her.'\n\nSmith was identified by police, in part, by his distinctive South African accent.\n\nAnchorage has a diverse population - more than 200 languages are spoken in the school system - and it's not uncommon to hear Russian, Yupik or Hmong accents. But South African accents aren't common, as just a fraction of the city's foreign-born population comes from Africa, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nJoanne Sakar, left, and Natasha Gamache hold a silent protest in a courtroom where they wore red hands painted on their face to represent the silencing of indigenous woman. Their protest highlighted Alaska's history of not properly investigating, prosecuting or sentencing perpetrators of crimes against Alaska Native women in Alaska\n\nTatauq Ruma, Abouchuk's niece, speaks to reporters outside a courtroom in Anchorage, Alaska, Monday\n\nSmith pictured in a courtroom prior to his October 16 arraignment above\n\nAfter the women were killed, their bodies were dumped along roads outside of Anchorage 'like unwanted trash,' the state says in a memorandum seeking $2 million bail on the more than a dozen counts he faces, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder and evidence tampering.\n\nIf convicted and found to have committed substantial torture in the Henry case, he will be sentenced to a mandatory 99 years. Alaska doesn't have the death penalty.\n\n'These were two Alaska Native women. And I know that hits home here in Alaska, and we're cognizant of that. We treat them with dignity and respect,' Anchorage Deputy District Attorney Brittany Dunlop told a recent news conference.\n\nJoanne Sakar and Natasha Gamache had red hands painted across their faces as they held a silent protest to highlight what Gamache called Alaska's history of not properly investigating, prosecuting or sentencing perpetrators of crimes against Alaska Native woman.\n\nKathleen Henry (pictured) was taking strong steps towards creating a new life and received her GED in 2012 when she was murdered at TownePlace Suites by Marriott in Anchorage\n\nSmith, 48, was arrested on October 8 after police linked him to a memory card found on the street that was labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott'. The SD card allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling a woman in a hotel room\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Smith was born in Queenstown, South Africa, and has been married to an Alaska native since 2014\n\nThe red hands painted on their faces represents the silencing of indigenous women.\n\n'There's a movement called Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women that seeks to highlight the level of violence that's perpetrated against indigenous women and how nationally our criminal justice system isn't taking it seriously. So, I'm here today to showcase that,' she said.\n\nPolice have released little information beyond what is in court documents. Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll said there's no evidence of a public safety threat.\n\nIn seeking the high bail, prosecutors cited Smith's ties to South Africa.\n\nPolice believe Smith (pictured with his wife in 2014) took all of the crime scene photos and videos himself. It is unclear whether he knew the victim beforehand\n\n'He poses a significant public safety risk, especially to the vulnerable, homeless women currently living on the streets of Anchorage,' a bail memo said.\n\nAuthorities said Smith came to Alaska about five years ago and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September.\n\nFive years ago, he married Stephanie Bissland of Anchorage. She was visiting family members in Virginia when Anchorage detectives approached her and told her of her husband's arrest in the first homicide.\n\nShe told Anchorage television station KTUU that last month, Smith reported his vehicle had been vandalized and that his wallet, documents and a briefcase with phones and other electronics had been taken. She said it wasn't unusual for Smith to have memory cards lying around from cameras and other gear he would work on and sell but said she never saw any of them labeled.", "description": "Suspected Alaska serial killer\u00a0Brian Steven Smith, 48, appeared in Anchorage court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to murdering a second woman.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20020814-0-image-a-39_1571721452117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
