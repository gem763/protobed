A statement from the campaign added that the vice president will introduce new tax policies to illustrate how he will pay for his proposed expansions in government spending\u2026\n\nBiden expressed interest in a financial transaction tax toward the end of the Obama administration when it was brought up by economic advisers, said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Baker said the vice president had been particularly impressed at a meeting by how much money could be raised solely by taxing Wall Street.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Business Biden-Advisers-Weigh-New-Wall-Street-Tax-Warren-Sanders-Pitch-Aggressive-Levies-Wealthy"], "top_image": ""}
