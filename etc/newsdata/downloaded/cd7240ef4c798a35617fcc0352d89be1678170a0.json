And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun,\" he reiterated.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, also commented on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement, saying in a tweet that the \u201cleft and their agenda\u2026 only believe in religious liberty if it\u2019s on their heavily dictated terms.\u201d\n\nNow do Sharia! Remember folks, you will never be woke enough to appease the left and their agenda. They only believe in religious liberty if it\u2019s on their heavily dictated terms. https://t.co/zy4XXaEx1N \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 11, 2019\n\n\"Does your church preach the Gospel? Then Beto O'Rourke wants to take away its tax-exemption,\" tweeted former GOP presidential candidate Hermain Cain.\n\nDoes your church preach the Gospel?

Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called O\u2019Rourke's proposal \u201cbigoted nonsense\u201d in a statement, writing that, \"This extreme intolerance is un-American. The whole point of the First Amendment is that, no matter who you love and where you worship, everyone is created with dignity and we don\u2019t use government power to decide which religious beliefs are legitimate and which aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFranklin Graham, son of legendary late preacher Billy Graham, who is known as an evangelist, social conservative activist and supporter of President Trump, said he \u201cwill not bow down at the altar of the LGBTQ agenda nor worship their rainbow pride flag.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I will not bow down at the altar of the LGBTQ agenda nor worship their rainbow pride flag. I\u2019m going to stand with the Word of God, the Holy Bible, which is truth from cover to cover. 3/3 \u2014 Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) October 11, 2019\n\nGraham has previously called on South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is another 2020 Democratic presidential contender, to repent for the 'sin' of being gay.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called O'Rourke \"the most honest Democrat running for President \u2013 he admits they want to shut down churches if they don\u2019t adhere to his beliefs,\" and continued that Democrats \"don\u2019t care about religious liberty.\"\n\n.@BetoORourke is the most honest Democrat running for President \u2013 he admits they want to shut down churches if they don\u2019t adhere to his beliefs.\n\n\n\nThe reality is, the Dems want to repeal the 1st and 2nd Amendments to the Constitution. They\u2019re saying it openly. https://t.co/vJDA7szsPM\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rick Scott (@ScottforFlorida) October 11, 2019\n\nDemocratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also running to be the Democratic presidential nominee next year, sidestepped directly answering the same question about tax exemptions at the CNN event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying, because I know this is a long legal battle. I\u2019m not dodging your question. I\u2019m saying I believe fundamentally that discrimination is discrimination,\" Booker said. \"And if you are using your position to try to discriminate against others, there must be consequences to that. And I will make sure to hold them accountable using the DOJ or whatever investigatory. You cannot discriminate.\"", "description": "O'Rourke was the target of pushback after he said that religious organizations opposed to same-sex marriage should not have tax-exempt status.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ua9gkNxslHq2chLLzKvubg--~B/aD0zMDY2O3c9NDQ4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/439af5e5cf9132e7277256ae5298e029", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
