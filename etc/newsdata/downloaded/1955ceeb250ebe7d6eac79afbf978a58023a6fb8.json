Sackler, a former member of Purdue\u2019s board and a son of one of its founders, according to the filings.\n\nThey point to $20 million shifted from a Purdue parent company to Sackler, who then redirected substantial amounts to shell companies that own family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Another $64 million in transfers to Sackler came from a previously unknown family trust, using a Swiss account, prosecutors said in their filing.\n\nRepresentatives for the branch of the family that includes Mortimer D.A. Sackler did not respond to requests for comment Friday.\n\nThe filing, made in a New York court, follows decisions by that state and others to reject a tentative settlement with Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, announced this week, arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company\u2019s and family\u2019s alleged roles in flooding U.S. communities with prescription painkillers.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Purdue is likely to soon file for bankruptcy protection. But New York and other states have promised they will continue to pursue the Sacklers, alleging that family members drained more than $4 billion from the company over the past dozen years. The family has used a complex chain of companies and trusts to control their holdings, some located in offshore tax havens.\n\nThe Sacklers had an estimated net worth of $13 billion as of 2016, making them America\u2019s 19th-richest family, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nIn its filing Friday, New York told a state judge that the only way it can determine the full extent of those transfers is if all those it has subpoenaed are forced to provide documents detailing their interactions with the Sackler family.\n\n\u201cWhile the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct. The limited number of documents provided to us so far underscore the necessity for compliance with every subpoena,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a prepared statement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves, New York's attorney general contends in court papers filed Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Adam Geller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/opioid_crisis_purdue_81250_c0-203-4850-3030_s1770x1032.jpg?7fcd78e75c457096c456398c9c78bad79a167809", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
