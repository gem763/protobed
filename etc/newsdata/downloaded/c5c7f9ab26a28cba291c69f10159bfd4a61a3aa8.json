Biden\u2019s presidential campaign to stop running a controversial attack ad purchased by President Trump\u2019s re-election team.\n\nIn a letter to the Biden campaign seen by The Washington Times, Facebook said the 30-second video ad will remain on the platform because it does not violate any of the company\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d wrote Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, The New York Times first reported.\n\nThe video ad bought by Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign claims that Mr. Biden, former President Barack Obama\u2019s running mate and current Democratic front-runner, pressured the Ukrainian government while in office to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating a company with business ties to his son.\n\nMr. Biden has denied wrongdoing, and both the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee have taken issue with the ad and asked platforms not to run it.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement about Facebook\u2019s decision to allow the attack ad, CNN reported.\n\nFacebook told The Washington Times that ads from politicians are not eligible for review by the company\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners, and the ad was allowed to remain because it was otherwise in compliance with the company\u2019s advertising policies and community standards.\n\nThe video is part of a $10 million advertising blitz launched by Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign on the heels of Democrats initiating an impeachment inquiry last month amid revelations emerging about the president having asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Bidens during a July phone call.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cperfect,\u201d and that the impeachment proceedings are a Democratic-led \u201choax\u201d and \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nCNN said last week that it would not run the anti-Biden ad, saying it falls short of the cable network\u2019s standards and \u201cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d No other major outlets have followed suit.\n\nFacebook\u2019s vice president announced late last month that the social network would refrain from fact-checking ads for politicians purchased on its platforms. Seema Nanda, the DNC\u2019s chief executive officer, responded after that Facebook\u2019s policy change would effectively let Mr. Trump \u201cmislead the American people on their platform unimpeded\u201d by not vetting the claims appearing in ads purchased by his re-election campaign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
