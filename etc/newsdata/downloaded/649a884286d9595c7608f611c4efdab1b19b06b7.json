They're so important, in fact, that they hold ranks themselves, and they're always ranked one higher than their handlers.\n\nThat seniority honors the dog's role and reminds the handler to be lenient when it has a bad day.\n\nThe dog who chased after Baghdadi, leading to his death by suicide, has become a celebrity \u2014 even though the dog's name remains classified. A photo of the dog led to confirmation of its breed (a Belgian Malinois), but little else is known about the good boy (or girl).

Bray / US Marine Corps / DVIDS\n\nHandlers have to be able to communicate what their canine partners are \"telling\" them, and to know without a doubt that the dog will listen to him or her.\n\n\"There's no doubt about my dog: Number one, he will protect me. Number two, he will find a bomb,\" Sgt. 1st Class Regina Johnson told the Army in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary working dogs are non-commissioned officers (NCOs).", "description": "The military working dog who chased Baghdadi is one of many dogs working important jobs in the military.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b6TJSyUVsOFV7PKm2RqHeA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/abd1dce61985eed2ba98c30615af9443", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
