But the ERT says: \u201cThere is no way to cross the river in spring or autumn due to moving ice.\u201d\n\nTravellers do not have to wait long for winter. The river normally freezes at Yakutsk in late October, and remains frozen for 30 weeks.\n\nYakutsk has an average high of -35C in December. At this temperature, reported Shaun Walker for The Independent, \u201cThe air is cold enough to numb exposed skin quickly, making frostbite a constant hazard.\u201d\n\nWhen he ventured outside in a temperature of minus 43C, he reported: \u201cThe first place to suffer is the exposed skin on my face, which begins to sting, and then experience shooting pains, before going numb, which is apparently dangerous, because it means blood flow to the skin has stopped.\u201d\n\nHe abandoned the experiment after 13 minutes.\n\nBut Henry Lansdell, a British traveller who visited late 19th century, wrote: \u201cYakutsk has the credit of being the coldest place upon the face of the earth.\n\n\u201cSo accustomed, however, do the natives become to the cold, that with the thermometer at unheard-of degrees below freezing point, the Yakut women, with bare arms, stand in the open-air markets, chattering and joking as pleasantly as if in genial spring.\u201d\n\nThe rail journey from Moscow takes about a week, with a third-class fare equivalent to \u00a3130. In summer, however, the new rail link may prove more tempting than the existing terrestrial transport: a five-day, 1,250-mile journey by the Krasnoyarsk paddle-steamer departing every 17 days from the Siberian river port of Ust Kut.\n\nAnother visitor, Margaret Campbell, wrote in The Independent: \u201cThe Krasnoyarsk is not a cruise ship and amenities are basic. One hot meal a day is served in the ship\u2019s canteen. Showers cost about 25p each. Toilets are seat-less and paper-less.\u201d\n\nBut passengers are treated to a slow-motion journey through the world\u2019s largest country: \u201dThe fir, larch and cedar trees were occasionally separated by meadows clustered around hamlets that may or may not have been ghost villages.\n\n\u201cChekhov\u2019s description of the taiga was apt: \u2018Where it ends, only the migrating birds know\u2019.\u201d\n\nMost travellers between Moscow and Yakutsk prefer to fly. There are several daily flights from the Russian capital to the city, a distance of around 3,100 miles.", "description": "The world\u2019s coldest city is now easier to reach,\u00a0thanks to a new rail link.
