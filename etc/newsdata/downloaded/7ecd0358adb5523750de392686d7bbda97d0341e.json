Only Italy's Stefano Raimondo proved faster, taking gold with a lighting quick 1:05.58.\n\n\"It feels great. I beat my personal best by almost one second, I didn't expect that,\" said Leroux\n\nWATCH | Leroux's silver-winning performance:\n\nCanada's James Leroux breaks the Americas in the 100m breaststroke with a time of 1:10.07. 2:25\n\nThe podium performance also earned Leroux a nomination to represent Canada at the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo.\n\n\"I was kind of thinking about a medal, but I didn't want to focus on that,\" said Leroux. \" I just wanted to focus on my race. The strategy was to control my aggressiveness in my first 50 to have more energy coming back, and obviously it worked.\"\n\nAur\u00e9lie Rivard wins 4th medal\n\nAurelie Rivard took home her fourth medal of the week, after edging Australia's Jasmine Greenwood for bronze in the women's 100m backstroke S10 final.\n\nIt was the 13th championship medal in Rivard's already storied career, but her first in this event.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it when I saw I got bronze. This is crazy. I rarely practice the 100 back. To be honest, I was kind of hoping for fourth, I would have been ok with that,\" said the 23-year-old native of St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que.\n\nWATCH | Aurelie Rivard captures 4th medal:\n\nCanada's Aur\u00e9lie Rivard places 3rd with a time of 1:10.69. 3:05\n\nEarlier in the week, Rivard triumphed in the 50 and 100 freestyle, while also netting a silver in the 400 free.\n\nThe results also helped Rivard earn her spot in Tokyo next summer.\n\n\"For sure, 13 career medals at worlds is impressive. I never would have thought I'd get there. The thing I'm most happy about though is that after 10 years, I'm still this competitive, and I'm even able to claim a medal in a new event.\"\n\nThe championships, which also serve as the first qualifying opportunity for Tokyo 2020, run until Sunday at the London Aquatics Centre. The finals will be streamed daily beginning at 1 p.m. ET on cbcsports.ca.", "description": "Canada\u2019s medal count at the world para swimming championships stands at 12 after James Leroux and Aur\u00e9lie Rivard swam to medals at the biennial event being held in London, England on Saturday.", "authors": ["Cbc Sports"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284243.1568509699!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/leroux-james-091419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
