Ted Cruz says 'just bring it' to basketball challenge", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Ted Cruz has accepted another basketball challenge by none other than 2020 presidential hopeful Andrew Yang.\n\nThe Texas Republican who defeated comedian Jimmy Kimmel in a June 2018 charity game is poised to shoot hoops with Mr. Yang.\n\nFox News producer Pat Ford served as the catalyst for the event after watching footage of the Democrat display his skills in Houston.\n\n\u201cNeed a @AndrewYang v @tedcruz game,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday in response to a local ABC interview.\n\nMr. Cruz joked that candidates must \u201cpoll at 5% or more to play on my court,\u201d but he reconsidered once shown polling with Mr. Yang sitting at precisely that mark.\n\n\u201cHmm. You\u2019re taller than I am,\u201d Mr. Cruz tweeted Thursday. \u201cFrom the video, you\u2019re probably a better shot. And, I\u2019ve seen you dunking (on an 8-foot rim). Altogether, pretty strong. So\u2026\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s tweet included a clip of Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson in the wrestling ring with the caption: \u201cJust bring it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d Mr. Yang responded. \u201cMy team will reach out. Let\u2019s raise some money for good causes. Looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang is an entrepreneur who has vowed to \u201cimplement the Freedom Dividend, a universal basic income (UBI) for every American adult over the age of 18: $1,000 a month, no strings attached, paid for by a new tax on the companies benefiting most from automation.\u201d\n\nHe will take the stage Thursday evening in Houston with nine other candidates vying to become the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee.\n\nABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Linsey Davis, David Muir, and Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos will moderate the debate, which airs from 8-11 p.m. EDT.\n\nFantastic. My team will reach out. Let\u2019s raise some money for good causes.
