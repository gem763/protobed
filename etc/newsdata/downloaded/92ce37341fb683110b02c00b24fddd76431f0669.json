According to six people, including senators, congressional aides and an administration official, Trump officials are discussing allowing Venezuelans to live and work legally in the United States through one of two existing programs used to protect immigrants who come from nations that are devastated by war or natural disasters.\n\nThe move might cut against Trump\u2019s broader immigration record \u2014 the president has pushed to end the temporary legal status of other migrant groups in the U.S. and tried to nix legal protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But it could boost his political chances in 2020 as Trump works to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nOffering such protections would play well with Hispanics in Florida \u2014 not just the state\u2019s sizable Venezuelan-American population but like-minded Cuban Americans. It\u2019s a state Trump needs to win a second term. And although he narrowly won Florida in 2016, Trump\u2019s approval rating there has dipped dramatically since.\n\nIn June, Trump kicked off his re-election campaign at a boisterous rally in Florida, where the campaign and the Republican National Committee already have 18 staffers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good politics,\u201d said a top Florida Republican who talks to the president. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen. It makes sense on so many levels.\u201d\n\nStill, the move could anger Trump supporters who backed him in 2016 based on his vows to crack down on immigration by building a wall on the southern border and ending Obama-era programs that protected immigrants from deportation. In the past, immigrants who have fled their native countries and come to the United States are allowed to apply for protected status for 18 months at a time with the option to renew. But critics, including Trump, have argued that immigrants abuse the system by renewing repeatedly for decades, even though they don't become lawful permanent residents.\n\nStill, Trump relenting on this one issue likely wouldn\u2019t serve as a deal breaker for his backers, given the president\u2019s continued harsh rhetoric and actions on immigration.\n\nEven those who oppose Trump acknowledge that protecting Venezuelans \u2014 through either the Temporary Protective Status or Deferred Enforced Departure programs \u2014 would be \u201ca smart good political move\u201d for the president as he tries to show he\u2019s not monolithic on the issue of immigration.\n\nSteve Schale, a Floridian who worked for Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns and now backs former vice president Joe Biden, a top Trump rival in the state, said the decision could help Trump win over enough voters to make a difference in a state where races are won and lost on small margins.\n\n\u201cFlorida is an incredibly tight state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you carve out a few points.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no state is more important to Trump than Florida. The nation\u2019s battleground state is home to several Trump resorts, including Mar-a-Lago, where he spends many weekends during the winter \u2014 more than 100 days so far since inauguration \u2014 and where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs in the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\u201cYou can't win if you\u2019re a Republican without Florida,\u201d said the Republican close to Trump. \u201cAnd I think the campaign knows it.\u201d\n\nIn June, Trump kicked off his re-election campaign at a boisterous rally in Florida, where the campaign and the Republican National Committee already have 18 staffers and thousands of volunteers.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to be back in my second home,\u201d Trump told the thousands of supporters gathered in Orlando. \u201cThat's what it is. It's my second home. In many cases, I think I could say it's my first home, if you want to know the truth. It\u2019s the great state of Florida.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a significant number of Cuban Americans in South Florida \u2014 who tend to disproportionately vote Republican \u2014 didn\u2019t back Trump after he ran against Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, in the Republican presidential primary. But Cuban Americans heavily supported a pair of Florida Republicans who Trump endorsed last year \u2014 Sen. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis. In 2020, Trump is looking to win over those voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a significant Venezuelan population and the president\u2019s strong positions against those dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela resonate tremendously with those populations, so we think we\u2019ll do very well there,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.\n\nDemocrats recognize that Trump is making a push for Hispanics, and have launched a Spanish-language radio program to counter the Trump campaign\u2019s outreach to Venezuelan population.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Department of Homeland Security referred questions to the State Department.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on internal discussions,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, we are focused on transformation in Venezuela and getting that country back on the road to stability for the benefit of all Venezuelans.\u201d\n\nThe renewed push to protect Venezuelans came after Congress failed this summer to pass a bill to allow them to stay for 18 months in the U.S., with opportunities for extensions. More than 4 million Venezuelans have fled their country\u2019s turmoil in recent years, according to the United Nations. About 200,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. would be eligible for the bill\u2019s protections, according to a Congressional Budget Office review.\n\n\u201cI definitely think there is a solution we can get to,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a vocal Trump surrogate and adviser.\n\nRubio, Scott and DeSantis have spoken directly to Trump about the issue, according to three of the six people. Scott also said he has made his case to Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services and one of the president\u2019s top advisers on immigration.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t go back,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview about Venezuelans. \u201cThey are in this ridiculous limbo. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to do something to take care of them.\u201d\n\nAnother option the Trump administration is considering is a policy that would be an alternative to the more formal TPS program. \u201cBasically limited enforcement on Venezuelans who are here,\u201d according to a source close to Scott.\n\nRubio and Scott deny that political considerations have entered any discussions about the situation. But two people familiar with the administration's discussions say some officials have tried to persuade Trump in part by highlighting the political benefits.\n\n\u201cPolitically I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a downside,\u201d said former Florida Republican Congressman David Jolly, an outspoken Trump critic. \u201cThe political impact would be marginal at best, but Florida elections are decided at the margins.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Trump has made toppling Maduro one of his top foreign policy proposals. In January, he recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s legitimate interim president. Since then, he has hit Maduro and his associates with severe economic sanctions, and even floated the possibility of military action.\n\n\u201cObviously there is a large Venezuelan community in Florida, but how can you on one hand have foreign policy that says Maduro is a genocidal thug starving the people of Venezuela and at the same time send people back?\u201d said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Elliott Abrams, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Venezuela, have been urging Trump to take action. Even Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser and most influential advocate for stricter immigration policies, has accepted that it will happen, according to one person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThe TPS program, which Congress created in nearly three decades ago, has allowed more than 300,000 immigrants from about a dozen countries to legally remain in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to let the program expire for most countries, including Haiti, El Salvador and Honduras. But a federal judge in California temporarily stopped the government from terminating the program for some countries. Trump has long called on Congress to address the issue.\n\n\"Much like the rest of our humanitarian immigration programs, TPS is being abused,\" said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which pushes for immigration restrictions. \u201cIf it can't be fixed by Congress, then President Trump should avoid any new designations or extensions. He must remember this is about policy, not politics.\u201d\n\nGary Fineout and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.", "description": "The president may offer Venezuelans protections, in a move that could help win over Hispanic voters in Florida ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar", "Daniel Lippman", "Jan Cienski"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171211999-1200x628.jpg"}
