Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Police Department.\n\nKhaseen Morris\n\nSome took out their phones and documented the fight on social media, but no one stepped in to help Khaseen, who died from his wounds after being taken to the hospital, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, before any arrests had been made, Fitzpatrick said it was a \"prearranged\" fight over a \"girl and a perception of who she might be dating or who she might be hanging with at this time.\"\n\n\"That dispute boiled over here, where a group of six to seven males charged at the victim and his couple of friends, and during that melee, stabbed him,\" Fitzpatrick said, standing in front of the strip mall where the fight took place.\n\nHe said several of those in the crowd have come forward with information.\n\nSapone said Thursday that \"there is more to this than what is depicted on the videos\" and what some of the witnesses are saying.\n\n\"We are not making direct comments concerning the victim at this time,\" Sapone said. \"Instead, we choose to remain completely respectful. However, there is ample evidence that is being discovered by our team that that group has a connection to the Bloods street gang.\"\n\nReached by CNN Thursday, Khaseen's older sister, Keyanna Morris, said she was sad and angry to hear Sapone's comments.\n\n\"I was disgusted and sick to my stomach that this lawyer tried to paint a picture of my brother that this was gang-related,\" Morris said.\n\n\"He was so against gang violence, so against violence towards anyone,\" she said.\n\nKhaseen was happy, his sister says\n\nMorris described her brother as \"good pure soul\" who would walk into a room \"just smiling\" and make \"everyone so happy.\"\n\nThe youngest of four siblings, Morris liked skateboarding and dying his hair, his sister told CNN.\n\nMorris had just started his senior year at Oceanside, where he had made new friends after attending school in Freeport, a village on Long Island, where his sister said he'd been unhappy.\n\n\"This is the happiest I've been in years,\" he told his mother on Friday, according to his sister.\n\nKeyanna, through tears, described watching video of her brother's death.\n\n\"He just laid there in his blood and nobody helped him,\" she said.\n\nThe steadiness of the video, focused on her dying brother, pained her.\n\n\"That's just sick,\" she said. \"Who would just stand there and watch a kid in blood?\"\n\nFitzpatrick said he didn't know what to make of the number of bystanders who failed to assist Morris. \"Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen. They would rather video this event. They videoed his death instead of helping him,\" he said.\n\nMemorial next week\n\nMemorial services for Morris will be held on September 28, according to his sister.\n\nGoFundMe account has been set to assist the family with funeral expenses.\n\nOceanside School District Superintendent Phyllis Harrington said in a video posted Thursday that the district is doing \"everything necessary\" to protect students and staff. She asked that parents talk to their children about social media use, cautioning users not to \"engage in spreading rumors.\" CNN has reached out to the school district for comment.\n\nNassau County Executive Laura Curran said in a statement that additional police officers would be assigned to patrol Oceanside High School and neighboring schools. \"I want to plead with all our residents -- not just our young people: If you see someone in serious danger, please use your phone to get help -- not likes and shares,\" she said.", "description": "Soon after school let out on Monday, a deadly fight broke out at a strip mall near Oceanside High School in Nassau County, New York.
