One only has to see how traditional TV viewing began declining among younger U.S. consumers during the earlier parts of this decade for a good example.\n\nHere's a look at the numbers Piper's survey turned up for some popular consumer tech products and services.\n\nThe iPhone and Apple Watch\n\nA whopping 83% of surveyed teens said they own an iPhone. That's even with Piper's spring 2019 survey and compares with 82% a year ago. In addition, 86% of respondents said they plan for the next smartphone they buy to be an iPhone, a figure that's even with both the spring 2019 and fall 2018 surveys.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of respondents reported owning an Apple Watch, even with spring 2019 but up from just 12% a year ago. 23% of respondents said they intend to buy a Watch, compared with 22% in spring 2019 and 17% in fall 2018.\n\nThough a discussion of the various reasons why Apple (AAPL) maintains such a high smartphone share among U.S. teens would require a separate article, it's worth noting that the popularity of Apple's iMessage service among U.S. teens is a factor that probably hasn't gotten enough attention, given that iMessage is only available on Apple devices.\n\nYouTube and Netflix\n\nAlphabet/Google's (GOOGL) YouTube passed Netflix (NFLX) for the status of the video service that teens most commonly said was the one they watched the most. Thirty-seven percent of teens reported that YouTube is the service they watched the most, while 35% said it was Netflix. In the spring, the numbers were respectively 32% and 37%. This probably won't help with Reed Hastings' self-professed feelings of \"YouTube envy.\"\n\nBut while Netflix lost ground to YouTube, which in 2017 saw its daily global viewing top 1 billion hours, Hastings' firm was still well ahead of rival subscription-based video services in Piper's survey. Only 7% and 3% of respondents respectively said that Hulu and Amazon.com's (AMZN) Prime Video were the video services they watched the most.\n\nAlso of note: A mere 12% of respondents said they watched cable TV the most, down from 14% in spring 2019 and 16% in fall 2018.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nNot surprisingly, Amazon remains in a league of its own among U.S. teens when it comes to e-commerce websites. 52% of respondents said that Amazon.com was their favorite shopping website, up from 50% in the spring of 2019 and 47% in the fall of 2018.\n\nNike (NKE) claimed the #2 spot, with 4% of respondents saying it was their favorite shopping website. Notably, just 2% of respondents said eBay (EBAY) was their favorite, putting the online marketplace in a tie for fifth place with PacSun.\n\nSocial Media Platforms\n\nFacebook's (FB) Instagram and Snap Inc.'s (SNAP) remain the most widely-used social media platforms among U.S. teens, with 85% and 81% of respondents respectively saying they use them. Instagram's figure was even with what was reported a year ago, while Snapchat's was down slightly from 84%.\n\n40% of teens said they use Twitter (TWTR) , down from 47% a year ago. And just 31% said they use Facebook proper, down from 36%. Pinterest (PINS) came in at 25%, up slightly from 23%.\n\nFacebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.
