The first film had a much stronger domestic showing, opening to nearly $70 million domestically in 2014, and the sequel was expected to earn more stateside. Although\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as strong as we hoped domestically, but it\u2019s a good start for October and we have a great window leading into Halloween,\u201d said Cathleen Taff, Disney\u2019s president of theatrical distribution. \u201cMost encouraging is the fact that audiences seem to be responding very positively.\u201d\n\nThe A CinemaScore \u2014 in contrast to the mixed critical reviews \u2014 suggests that the film could have a longer life at the box office.\n\nAlthough it fell to second place after two weekends at the top, Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cJoker\u201d continues to hold strong at the box office. It added $29.2 million in its third weekend in North America. The villain origin story has grossed over $247 million domestically. Worldwide, it\u2019s earned $737.5 million, and has already surpassed the lifetime grosses of \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d\n\nNow the big question is whether the R-rated film will make it to $1 billion, but with a $55 million production budget, it\u2019s already a massive hit for the studio and will likely also become director Todd Phillips\u2019 highest-grossing film too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already in territory that nobody thought it would get to. It\u2019s achieved a box office that is above the wildest expectations of the studio and analysts,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cEven if the box office stopped right now it\u2019s an absolute, unqualified success.\u201d\n\nThird place went to another new sequel, Columbia Pictures\u2019 \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d with $26.7 million. The R-rated comedy comes 10 years after the original, reuniting Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson with director Ruben Fleischer.\n\n\u201cThree films earning over $25 million, that doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d Dergarabedian noted, although the weekend is down from last year when \u201cHalloween\u201d opened to over $76 million.\n\nIn notable landmarks, \u201cHustlers\u201d crossed $100 million domestically this weekend. It\u2019s the second STX film to do so this year after \u201cThe Upside.\u201d\n\nAnd buzzy, awards-friendly indies are continuing to thrive. \u201cParasite,\u201d which opened last weekend, added $1.2 million. This weekend, Taika Waititi\u2019s Nazi satire \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d opened in five theaters with a strong $350,000, the black and white Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe mindbender \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d earned $419,764 from eight theaters, and \u201cJay & Silent Bob Reboot\u201d grossed $93,520 from one screen this weekend.\n\nBut the year is still down 5% from last year.\n\n\u201cIt was a great weekend for sequels and great weekend for indie movies,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still struggling to get ahead of last year. We\u2019re racing to the finish line here. We\u2019ve only got 11 weekends left to go.\u201d\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
