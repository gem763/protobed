(AP Photo/Elmer Martinez)\n\nTEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) \u2014 Opposition groups called Saturday for continuing protests to demand that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez be removed from office after his younger brother was convicted of drug trafficking in a New York court.\n\nThousands of Hondurans protested into the early hours of the morning after Juan Antonio \"Tony\" Hern\u00e1ndez was convicted Friday in what U.S. prosecutors described as a conspiracy that relied on \"state-sponsored drug trafficking.\"\n\nProtesters blocked key roads in half of the country's 18 provinces, setting barricades ablaze, while some took advantage of the disturbances to loot stores. Police had not reported any arrests and urged protesters to express their concerns \"peacefully without affecting the right of others.\"\n\nPresident Hern\u00e1ndez insisted via Twitter that the verdict is not against the state of Honduras, saying his government has fought drug trafficking. On Saturday he attended a parade to honor the country's armed forces and posted pictures of himself on Twitter smiling alongside the U.S. charg\u00e9 d'affaires to Honduras, Colleen Hoey.\n\nWith Hoey at the parade, Hern\u00e1ndez said he discussed ways to strengthen ties between the two countries while also fighting drug trafficking and organized crime.\n\nThe president has accused Honduran drug traffickers extradicted to the U.S. of retaliating against his family by alleging that his younger brother is a drug dealer aided by the government.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez assumed a second four-year term as president in January 2018, despite a constitutional ban on re-election.\n\nConvicted drug dealers asserted during the U.S. trial against his brother that they contributed to both of Hern\u00e1ndez's campaigns for president on promises that he would protect their businesses and them while in office.\n\nA son of Honduras' previous president, Porfirio Lobo, admitted in 2017 to being part of a cocaine-trafficking network and was sentenced to 24 years of prison in the U.S.", "description": "Opposition groups called Saturday for continuing protests to demand that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez be removed from office after his younger brother was convicted of drug trafficking in a New York court.
