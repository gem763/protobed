This time, however, they are holding secret hearings to prevent the American people from learning the facts and deciding for themselves.\n\n\u2026 They have leaked portions of the transcript and select documents from the Volker deposition in a desperate attempt to deceive the country. The American people deserve transparency, and we are calling on these chairmen to immediately deliver the full and complete transcript immediately.\n\nThe president on Tuesday announced that he would not let Ambassador Gordon Sondland testify to Congress later that day as scheduled.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a supporter of the president, called the inquiry a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and a \u201cclown show\u201d:\n\nAs far as the administration goes, if they don\u2019t want to send Amb. Sondland here because this is a kangaroo court, because there has not been a vote once on impeachment inquiry, because minority does not have any rights for subpoenas, because the president doesn\u2019t have the right to have counsel present to ask questions, for subpoena power, to present evidence. This entire thing is a political charade. It\u2019s a clown show.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u201cCaptain Kangaroo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court, and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Democrats have also denied President Trump\u2019s counsel the ability to attend depositions, briefings, and interviews. It is also unclear whether or not the president\u2019s counsel will be permitted to object to testimony or introduce evidence.\n\nHouse Democrats are also considering having the first official who filed a whistleblower complaint against Trump testify remotely with his face and voice obscured so that Republican lawmakers and staffers would not be able to find out his identity.\n\nA lawyer for the whistleblower told Breitbart News on Tuesday that the official, or any others they represent, do not intend to come forward publicly, raising the prospect that an impeachment inquiry of Trump would be prompted entirely by an anonymous official who is reportedly a Democrat and had a working relationship with a 2020 Democrat candidate.\n\nThe mainstream media has downplayed or flat out ignored that the impeachment proceedings have not met the recognized standards of other similar efforts.\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are pursuing the impeachment of Trump.\n\nSchiff and the chairmen of the other two panels argue that Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son in exchange for foreign aid, a claim denied by the U.S. president.", "description": "The impeachment inquiry process so far is akin to a \"kangaroo court\" led by Democrats already convinced Trump is guilty, Republicans said.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong", "Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Democrat-Impeachment-Inquiry-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
