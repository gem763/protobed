Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 18/32 in price to yield 1.5359%, from 1.597% late on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe big question for a lot of folks is whether this is the third slowdown since the financial crisis or are we now heading for a global recession?\u201d said Anujeet Sareen, a fixed income portfolio manager and global macro strategist for Brandywine Global. He said his base case scenario was for a slowdown, and added that the unpredictability of U.S. President Donald Trump was a complicating factor.\n\n\u201cThe wild card in the pack is always Donald Trump and whatever he tweets next.\u201d\n\nAsian shares racked up losses earlier in the day. Japan's Nikkei stock index .N225 closed down 2%, its biggest one-day decline since Aug. 26.\n\n\u201cRisk aversion is broadly on the rise and that has been triggered by the weakness in U.S. manufacturing ISM data earlier this week,\u201d said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\n\u201cThe outperformance of the U.S. economy compared to other major economies has held the dollar and other risky assets up but that has changed this week.\u201d\n\nThe weak economic data has increased market expectations that the Fed will cut rates again. Traders see a 98% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nBets on a rate cut could rise further if a U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday shows weakness in the labour market.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures were last down 0.3% to $57.51 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell 0.8% to $52.22 per barrel.\n\nGraphic: Global assets in 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl\n\nGraphic: Global currencies versus dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019.
