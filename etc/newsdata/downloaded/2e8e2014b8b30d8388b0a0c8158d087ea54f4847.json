Kennedy International airport through their apps.\n\nThe company announced its Uber Copter offer on Thursday, saying flights to and from Lower Manhattan will become available to all Uber users on Oct. 3. Uber made the feature available to its premium members in June.\n\nThe roughly eight-minute flight will cost between $200 and $225 per person and include ground transportation on either side of the trip. Passengers can bring along a small suitcase and have to watch a safety video before takeoff, similar to that on an airplane.\n\nThe flights are operated by HeliFlite Shares, a licensed company, and Uber\u2019s prices roughly compare to those of competitors offering helicopter rides to JFK.\n\nFor now, Uber rides shuttling passengers to the heliport in Manhattan are only available from the southern tip of the island.\n\nUber says the service is intended to reduce travel times, but when Reuters tried Copter on Wednesday, a trip from its Midtown office to the airport took 70 minutes, including a subway ride downtown and two Uber rides to and from the heliport. That\u2019s about the same time it would have taken by regular taxi in moderate traffic.\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman on Thursday said that trip was not realistic as part of the commercial rollout, however, as the Copter option is only shown to customers located in the geofenced Lower Manhattan area.\n\n\u201cUber Copter won\u2019t appear as an option in the app if you are outside of the geofence because it wouldn\u2019t provide time savings,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nBut Uber might gradually expand the Manhattan pick-up zone, said Eric Allison, head of Elevate, Uber\u2019s aerial ride-hailing program.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cHelicopters are certainly expensive and it will be a premium product, but we think we\u2019re actually able to offer a fairly accessible entry point with Uber Copter,\u201d Allison said during an interview on Wednesday.\n\nJFK is one of the countTry\u2019s largest airports and car trips from congested Manhattan can take anywhere from one to two hours, while public transit takes between 50 and 75 minutes.\n\nWith concerns mounting over congestion and vehicle emissions, Uber hopes its NYC Copter project will pave the way for Uber Air, a taxi service of electric \u201cvertical take-off and landing\u201d aircraft.", "description": "Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc is taking to the air in New York City where users with a little cash to spare will soon be able to book helicopter flights to John F.
