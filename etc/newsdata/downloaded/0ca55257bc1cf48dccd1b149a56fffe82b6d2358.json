One that he had never wanted or expected to give.\n\nThe Incredible Sulk came out angry. Sulk shouty. Sulk guilty. There was no contrition. No humility. A normal person would have \u2019fessed up and resigned. But this was the speech of a serial offender \u2013 the narcissistic sociopath \u2013 who couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d been caught red-handed yet again. \u201cI done nothing,\u201d sulked Sulk. He had been fitted up. The supreme court had got it wrong. Technically he was innocent. The electronic tag fitted by Lady Hale the previous day proved otherwise.\n\nLie followed lie. Lying is one of the only things Boris can be trusted to do. The prorogation had been perfectly normal. The Brexit negotiations were well advanced. Everything was going splendidly. The real problem wasn\u2019t him. It was everyone else in Westminster. So give him an election and allow him to break his word on avoiding no deal.\n\nJeremy Corbyn wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for Classic Dom\u2019s last roll of the dice. But even so, his response was half-arsed. To put it kindly. The Labour leader had the prime minister on the ropes. The government\u2019s credibility and integrity were in tatters but he could barely lay a punch. This was two washed-up drunks getting lairy in a pub at closing-time.\n\nThe Tory benches cheered. But the applause was laden with desperation. They know Johnson is a fraud. They know they\u2019ve made a mistake. Worse, they know they are complicit. They and Johnson are parasitic, their survival dependent on the other. But what neither realises is that they are in a death spiral, draining each other\u2019s lifeblood. The eyes are already dead, their bodies hollowed-out shells.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t even their nadir. That came when Johnson said, \u201chumbug\u201d in response to Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff mentioning the death of Jo Cox. An insult compounded by him insisting the only way to honour her memory was to deliver his Brexit. As if the reward for getting his way was that women would not be murdered. It was one of the most shameful episodes the Commons has witnessed in years. If Tory MPs had an ounce of integrity and self-worth they would force him to resign within hours. If.\n\nBut they don\u2019t. Many may subconsciously long for a no-confidence vote in The Sulk. Just to have the chance to do one thing in which they believe. But they will be denied. Their self-hatred will tear them apart. The punishment for their failure is their continued existence on life-support under the unforgiving gaze of parliament. And what\u2019s left of their consciences.\n\nThe Commons had reconvened in the morning with a short \u2013 as in not as long as many had feared \u2013 statement from the Speaker welcoming MPs back to their place of work. Then the first act of the day\u2019s drama got under way. It was just that no one had told the attorney general if he was appearing in a tragedy or a farce as he answered an urgent question on his legal advice to the government over prorogation.\n\nLittle more than a year ago, Geoffrey Cox had been just another MP with a crazy dream. But then he had won Westminster\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 exclusively available on Hacker House TV, just dial 0800 and get a recorded message redirecting you to a woman in Florida \u2013 and had become its leading actor. The man with the golden voice. A shining beacon of intelligence in a cabinet of low voltage mediocrities. Today he blew it. A Star has Died.\n\nCox began by channelling his inner Ibsen in An Enemy of the People. The supreme court had ruled and the government would abide by its decision. The outcome hadn\u2019t been as he and other members of the legal team had hoped and it was a matter of deep, deep personal regret that he found himself unable to disclose what his own advice had been.\n\n\u201cNo one is suggesting for a moment that the supreme court has staged a constitutional coup,\u201d he declared, happy to make a passive-aggressive attack on Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had done just that 24 hours previously. Just for the fun of it. Shares in the leader in the house have steadily tumbled since he\u2019s been elevated to the cabinet. Rees-Mogg shuffled awkwardly on the frontbench. Where was nanny when you needed her?\n\nSo far, so good. But then Cox spoiled it all by insisting the government had at all times acted in good faith. Not even the dopiest Tory backbenchers believed that. As if trying to cover up this schoolboy error, Cox then went full-on space cadet. What followed was Brian Blessed appearing in a village hall farce, while out of his head on acid.\n\nThe arms started flailing and spit dribbled from his lips as the hallucinations became ever more intense. Then he went into spasms and rolled on the floor. The spiders, the spiders! They were everywhere, crawling up the walls. The hollow laughs of 11 Lady Hales echoed in his head. Parliament was a dead parliament. An ex-parliament with no moral right to sit. The government couldn\u2019t govern. Several MPs gently tried to talk him down by explaining the reason it couldn\u2019t govern was entirely the government\u2019s own fault for shedding 21 of its own MPs.\n\nNo luck. One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small. And the ones that Boris give you don\u2019t do anything at all. Parliament was just a waste of space. No one gave a shit about the domestic violence bill that could now be debated. Or about the Thomas Cook collapse. Hell, if you were poor enough to go on a package holiday then you deserved everything you got. Suckers. And why would anyone want to talk about Brexit?\n\nA nurse came in to administer a vitamin C injection. Anything to help the comedown. But Cox was still ranting as he was escorted out the chamber. His dog, Lucy, put her paws over her eyes in shame. She\u2019d told him to stick to a few joints. She\u2019d got more sense out of him when he\u2019d been down a K-hole in the recovery tent at Glastonbury. No wonder the government had lost in in the supreme court if he and Lord Keen were the best QCs on offer.
