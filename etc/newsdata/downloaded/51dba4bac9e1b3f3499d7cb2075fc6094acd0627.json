I was taught by a great woman, my mother, to honor women.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the shadow cast over his career by the misconduct allegations, fellow Democrats paid tribute to Conyers.\n\n\"His impact on our state, whether by spearheading reforms in criminal justice and voting rights in Congress or through his lifetime of civil rights activism, will not be forgotten,\" Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted to \"celebrate\" the late congressman's \"extraordinary service\".", "description": "John Conyers is remembered for his civil rights work, but his career ended under a cloud.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13396/production/_109424787_057602710-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
