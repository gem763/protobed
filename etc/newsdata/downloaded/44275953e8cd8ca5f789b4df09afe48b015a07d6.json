It also includes benefits like free preschool for low-to-moderate-income families and childcare subsidies.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris unveiled a family leave plan that would give new parents and caretakers six months of paid leave\n\nThe plan for paid family leave is all part of her larger 'Children's Agenda,' which aims to cut childhood poverty in half\n\nMost other Democratic candidates' plans include a 12-week paid leave period for parents after having a child. Some of the most progressive blue states have already passed laws that offer up to 12 weeks for family leave, but sometimes the included benefits don't match up to the individual's usual compensation.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race at the end of August, proposed the Family Act, which was endorsed by three front-runner candidates. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are all behind the proposal that would provide three months of paid leave.\n\nUp to 66 per cent of each parent's income would be covered under this plan by an overall increase to payroll taxes. Both new parents would be able to use the family leave benefit whenever they choose.\n\nHarris' plan would give 100 per cent of families' income to those earning less than $75,000 for the full six months. She did not clarify in her proposal what the percentage would be for those with higher incomes.\n\nDemocratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (upper left) proposed a plan that would created a 12-week federal family leave time. Front-runner 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders (upper right), Elizabeth Warren (lower left) and Pete Buttigieg (lower right) have all gotten on board with that plan\n\nLike Gillibrand's plan, the cost of Harris' would also come from raising payroll taxes \u2013 but would also come from raising corporate taxes and income taxes on the top 1 per cent.\n\nSix months of paid leave would be expensive, but Harris doesn't outline how much taxes would go up to help pay for it.\n\nThis issue, however, isn't partisan.\n\nIn February, Donald Trump's daughter and Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump went to Capitol Hill to appeal with republican lawmakers to push for a federal paid family leave program.\n\nTrump acknowledged senator's efforts at the time and said, 'It's encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle putting forward paid family leave proposals.'", "description": "Kamala Harris revealed her plan this week to give new parents six months off - by far the most ambitious plan of any other 2020 candidate.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447358-0-image-a-21_1570546512935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
