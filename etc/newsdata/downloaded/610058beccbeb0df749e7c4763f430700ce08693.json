He said they needed his custody for a polygraph test to verify the veracity of a video in which he is reportedly seen inciting people against the government.\n\nThe counsel, thus, pleaded with the court to grant remand of the accused.\n\nEarlier, on Oct 22, a judicial magistrate had sent Safdar to prison on judicial remand for fourteen days in a case pertaining to hate speech.\n\nJudicial Magistrate Rana Asif Ali rejected a request to discharge the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader in the case.\n\nHe also rejected a plea by Punjab police to hand Safdar over to them for interrogation.\n\nSafdar was arrested by the police on the night of Oct 21 from the motorway on the charge of issuing remarks and inciting public against the state.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/safdar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
