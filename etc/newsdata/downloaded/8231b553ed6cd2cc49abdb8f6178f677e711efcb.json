The \u201cBig Little Lies Star\u201d knows the hit ensemble cast show is competing for all those eyeballs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the wild, wild West right now in my industry,\u201d Woodley told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFiAM. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any right way or wrong way to do it. People are just experimenting. New technology and whatnot, brings the availability for a landscape that is totally novel in every single way possible.\u201d\n\nJust a week ago, Apple TV+ (AAPL) priced its OTT service at $4.99, severely undercutting what some see as its top competitors Disney+ (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX). Earlier this summer, WarnerMedia (T) announced HBOMax \u2013 its streaming platform where viewers will have access to HBO, New Line, DC Entertainment, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim \u2013 that includes the rights to those classic sitcoms like \u201cFriends\u201d - that Netflix fans are losing - and \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d\n\nStreaming wars create opportunity in Hollywood\n\nWoodley tells Yahoo Finance the open landscape gives creators, writers, directors and actors immense options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting because it just means there is more job opportunities for people to create,\u201d said Woodley. \u201cThere\u2019s more opportunities for people at home to kind of choose their own adventure if you will when it comes to consuming media and consuming films and television shows.\u201d\n\nShailene Woodley attends the premiere of HBO's \"Big Little Lies\" season two at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, in New York.

Reese Witherspoon, one of Woodley\u2019s co-stars, will produce at least two romantic comedies, also slated for the platform: \u201cThe Flight Attendant,\u201d a one-hour thriller series based on the novel by Chris Bohjalian starring Kaley Cuoco, and \u201cLove Life\u201d a romantic comedy starring Anna Kendrick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild. It\u2019s kind of fun to sit back and witness it a little bit,\u201d said Woodley. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be a creator, but I also love the movie theater. The whole streaming wars thing is cool, but don\u2019t take our movie theaters away.\u201d\n\nWoodley\u2019s new film \u201cEndings, Beginnings\u201d is currently in theaters.\n\nTracey Marx Bernstein is a senior producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Shailene Woodley thinks the OTT/Streaming wars are good for Hollywood by creating opportunity for everyone in the industry.", "authors": ["Tracey Marx Bernstein", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ec0NwXfaOaINiLIiajAPxw--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xNDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/829cd2f0-d944-11e9-8b9f-82a39634bd80", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
