Airstrikes against ISIS could turn America into \u201cIran\u2019s air force,\u201d Paul wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled, \u201cAmerica Shouldn\u2019t Choose Sides in Iraq\u2019s Civil War.\u201d\n\nAs American public opinion changed, so did Paul\u2019s policy toward U.S. involvement in the war against ISIS. As late as August 29, 2014, Paul still wasn\u2019t sure if \u201cISIS is a threat to our national security.\u201d But then Paul, who harbored presidential ambitions at the time, abruptly issued a statement saying that he would destroy ISIS militarily.\n\n\u201cSome pundits are surprised that I support destroying the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) militarily. They shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Paul wrote on September 4 in Time magazine. \u201cIf I had been in President Obama\u2019s shoes, I would have acted more decisively and strongly against ISIS.\u201d Many of Paul\u2019s non-interventionist allies were baffled by his change of mind. \u201cThe sudden evaporation of Paul\u2019s doubts reeks of political desperation,\u201d wrote Jacob Sullum, a senior editor at the libertarian magazine Reason.\n\nIn 2015, Paul settled on a plan to defeat ISIS by arming the Kurds and promising them a country: \u201cI think they would fight like hell if we promised them a country.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds did fight like hell: 11,000 died fighting ISIS. But this week, President Trump decided it was not worth keeping 100 or fewer U.S. troops in northern Syria to deter a Turkish attack on America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Rand Paul loudly cheered him on.\n\nOn Wednesday, I noted Paul\u2019s 2015 comments about promising the Kurds their own country on the Corner, and on Thursday Senator Paul responded with a statement emailed by his communications director. \u201cI did and still do support a homeland for the Kurds \u2014 in Iraq \u2014 anyone who conflates the Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran into one simple homogenous, easily solvable problem is either naive or disingenuous,\u201d Paul said in the statement.\n\nFor the record, I never conflated the Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran \u201cinto one simple homogenous, easily solvable problem.\u201d My post simply pointed out that Paul had gone from promising to reward the Kurds who would fight ISIS with their own country to cheering on a decision to merely move \u2014 but not bring home \u2014 100 or fewer U.S. troops in order to enable Turkey\u2019s plan to slaughter America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nSenator Paul still supports a Kurdish homeland in Iraq, he says. But many of the Kurds who fought the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria live in Syria, not just Iraq. What do we owe them?\n\nDid we owe them better than abruptly pulling out 100 troops whose presence kept Turkey at bay? Does it really stand to reason that just because Turkey is a member of NATO we needed to do them a solid and abandon our battlefield allies who suffered more than 10,000 deaths in recent years in a war against one of America\u2019s worst enemies?\n\nWon\u2019t abandoning the Kurds make it more difficult for America to recruit allies in the future to fight our enemies, undermining a key objective of interventionists and non-interventionists alike? Wouldn\u2019t fulfilling Paul\u2019s promise to help stand up a Kurdish country involve a much greater American commitment than keeping 100 U.S. troops in northern Syria?\n\nThese are some of the questions I\u2019d like to ask Senator Paul. His communications director told me Thursday she had passed along the interview request, but I haven\u2019t heard back and doubt I will.\n\nThe Kentucky senator did find time Thursday to write on Twitter that the \u201cbloodlust\u201d of his fellow Americans who disagree with President Trump\u2019s decision \u201cknows no bounds.\u201d But as freshman Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, wrote: \u201cThe great irony of the \u2018no more endless wars\u2019 camp\u2019s argument is that removing our small and cost-effective force from Northern Syria is causing more war, not less. Our presence there was not meant to engage in endless wars, it was there to deter further warfare.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "In 2014, Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was all over the map on what, if anything, the United States should do to stop the growing army of jihadists known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.In June 2014, after ISIS conquered Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city at the time, Paul was very skeptical", "authors": ["John Mccormack"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zfyyMXPy2euqB65TnLuAcQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/93e07b1a961b9164f5c0cd8d92e89819", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
