But that ease of sending and requesting money with the press of a touchscreen button can get complicated if things don\u2019t go according to plan.\n\nReddit user equkelly posted yesterday that someone they didn\u2019t know sent them $1,500 on Venmo. \u201cI don\u2019t know this person is and I\u2019m assuming they sent it to the wrong user,\u201d they wrote in r/personalfinance.\n\nSeveral users quickly recommended the original poster not just return the money via Venmo, but instead contact Venmo to have the company manually initiate the refund. That\u2019s what the poster ultimately did, but other suggestions ranged from sending it back to doing nothing and having the sender initiate the return \u2014 and then still doing nothing and wait for Venmo to step in.\n\nIt\u2019s surely a confusing situation, and it\u2019s not unlike a recent instance where a couple discovered thousands of extra dollars in their bank account. But that couple went out and spent the money, which is decidedly not the best course of action.\n\nWhat to do about your mystery money\n\nSo what should you do if you get a notification that someone you don\u2019t know dropped money into your account? Assuming you\u2019re not publicly asking strangers to send you money, should you initiate a return? Notify the service provider?\n\nA Venmo representative said by email that if you suspect you\u2019re being targeted by a scammer through their app, you should contact support right away. This advice goes for any other online monetary service, including PayPal.\n\nAdditionally, Venmo\u2019s FAQ offers these instructions:\n\nWhat do I do if I receive a payment from a stranger? If you receive a payment from someone that you don\u2019t know, you can simply send a payment back to the other user with a note explaining that they paid the wrong person. You\u2019re also welcome to contact us to have us reverse the other person\u2019s payment back to them for you.\n\nWhile government agencies tend to be on top of the latest and greatest in scam attempts, information and alerts around online services are less common.\n\nWhat to do if you send money to the wrong person\n\nIn the meantime, what if you\u2019re the person who sent money to the wrong person? You\u2019re not a scammer, you just made a mistake. The Planet Money podcast had an episode about this, in which someone was in $2,200 worth of digital limbo because they spelled the user\u2019s name wrong. The money went to Stephen, not Steven.\n\nWith a credit card, you\u2019d request a chargeback to undo the mistake, Planet Money explained. But there\u2019s nothing traditional about peer-to-peer payment systems! While a service can step in to help, the app relies on users to work these sorts of issues out themselves first. Here\u2019s what Venmo\u2019s support page has to say about those situations:\n\nWhat do I do if I paid the wrong person? Send them a charge request for the same amount with a note asking them to pay you back for the money you sent by mistake. If you don\u2019t hear back from them or need help sending a charge request, feel free to check out this article for instructions on how to contact us. We\u2019d be happy to help!\n\nYou can also complete a charge back request via other online peer-to-peer payment services like PayPal, but your first step should always be checking and confirming who you're paying in the first place.", "description": "Peer-to-peer payment apps make it easy to split the bill with friends.
