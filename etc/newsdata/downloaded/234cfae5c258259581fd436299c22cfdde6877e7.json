Some of the works are by Da Vinci himself, while some are by other artists and are there to put the Italian maestro\u2019s work into context.\n\nThe exhibition also features infra-red imaging of paintings by da Vinci, revealing the layers of work that lie underneath the finished picture, so providing a glimpse of his working methods.\n\n\u201cLeonardo da Vinci paints very slowly. Each painting is a long improvement of shape and content\u201d, said Vincent Delieuvin, conservator of the Louvre Paintings department.\n\nDiplomatic frictions had cast a shadow over the organization of the Paris show, with former Italian Prime minister Matteo Salvini saying pointedly that da Vinci was Italian, not French.\n\nWhen his patron Giuliano de Medici died, da Vinci left Italy for France at the invitation of French king Fran\u00e7ois I. Appointed \u201cFirst Painter, Engineer and Architect to the King\u201d, the aging maestro settled at the Ch\u00e2teau du Clos Luc\u00e9, near the royal residence of Amboise.\n\nThe Mona Lisa, his most renowned work, has hung at the Louvre since the French Revolution and is viewed by around 30,000 visitors every day. That painting is not part of the exhibition.\n\nThe museum expects the da Vinci exhibition to have attracted at least half a million visitors by the time it closes on Feb. 24.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "France\u2019s Louvre museum, home to Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa, is putting the final touches to one of the biggest ever exhibitions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/leonardodivinci-exhib.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
