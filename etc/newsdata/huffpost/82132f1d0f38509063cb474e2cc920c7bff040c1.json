{"title": "National Farmers Union Head Scorches Trump: He's Offended 'Pretty Much Every Ally' On Earth", "pub_date": "2019-08-30 07:34:51-04:00", "text": "The president of the National Farmers Union has leveled an astonishingly frank broadside against President Donald Trump, who rural voters largely supported in the 2016 election.\n\nTrade group leader Roger Johnson said in a radio interview Thursday that it will take \u201cdecades\u201d to reverse damage caused by Trump. China, he added, is now a \u201clost market\u201d for American farmers because of Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nTrump has \u201coffended the leaders of pretty much every ally we have on Earth,\u201d and America\u2019s reputation in markets around the world has taken a long-lasting hit, Johnson said in an interview on KFGO radio in Fargo, North Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take much different behavior from future presidents in order to repair this damage,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson, whose organization represents some 200,000 family farms, ranches and fishing enterprises in 33 states, agreed that China needs to be \u201cheld to account\u201d for trade relationships and behavior. But he said that Trump would have been wiser to approach the world\u2019s second-largest economy with a team of allies.\n\n\u201cI would ... argue that it would be far more effective if we did it with the rest of world, instead of first ticking off the rest of the world and then trying to do it all by ourself,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for how Trump is dealing with China, Johnson added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can expect to make the fundamental changes that are being asked of China while every other day you\u2019re offending them, you\u2019re forcing them to lose face. No country\u2019s going to make changes when they\u2019re embarrassed along the way. That\u2019s just not how you do things.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ca lot of folks believe that China needs to be held accountable,\u201d but it\u2019s the way it\u2019s being done that\u2019s troubling. \u201cYou\u2019re increasingly going to find people who sort of say, \u2018This was just a mistake. This isn\u2019t the way you solve a real problem. It\u2019s just making things worse.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe called many of Trump\u2019s policy decisions \u201cvery harmful to agriculture; all the trade disruption has been enormously damaging.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the U.S. will suffer \u201creputational damage ... for literally decades.\u201d He also noted that \u201ctrade actions that this president have taken have done damage to lots of other parts of the economy\u201d as well.\n\nJohnson slammed the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 reportedly ordered by Trump \u2014 to grant waivers to 31 petroleum refineries effectively exempting them from having to use more corn-based ethanol in their products. It was yet another blow to struggling corn farmers in deference to what Johnson called the \u201cwealthiest oil companies on the face of the planet.\u201d\n\nKFGO interviewer Joel Heitkamp noted: \u201cYou can see how mad ag producers are when they see that big oil got the exemptions ... it\u2019s like the light finally got turned on and some of these guys woke up.\u201d\n\nFarmers \u201care in a lot of financial stress right now; net farm income is half of what it was six years ago,\u201d said Johnson.\n\n\u201cThis is really tough,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe\u2019re in a really, really difficult spot right now.\u201d\n\nCheck out the entire interview here.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68b9182500004e00898da5.jpeg?cache=kn2yigpi4e&ops=1778_1000"}
