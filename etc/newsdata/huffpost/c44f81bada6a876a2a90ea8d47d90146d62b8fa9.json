{"title": "Fox News Host Jeanine Pirro Just Promoted A White Supremacist Conspiracy Theory", "pub_date": "2019-08-30 06:36:28-04:00", "text": "Fox News host Jeanine Pirro has stirred fresh controversy by touting white supremacist ideals.\n\nIn a radio interview with Fox Nation\u2019s Todd Starnes on Thursday, Pirro was asked who she thought Democrats hated more \u2015 President Donald Trump or the people who put him into office.\n\nPirro responded by pushing a version of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, which centers around the idea that progressives want to replace white Americans with immigrants to change voting demographics. It was reportedly the motive for the suspect in the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting.\n\n\u201cWell, they hate Donald Trump. He\u2019s the one they want to get rid of because the people like you and me who put him into office, their plan and their plot to remake America is to bring in the illegals, change the way the voting occurs in this country, give them licenses,\u201d Pirro said.\n\n\u201cThey get to vote, maybe once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and you\u2019ve got motor voter registration on the day of the election,\u201d Pirro continued, echoing Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of voter fraud.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got voter rolls that haven\u2019t been purged of dead people in years where the Democrats have resisted that,\u201d she added. \u201cThink about it. It is a plot to remake America, to replace American citizens with illegals who will vote for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nListen to the clip here:\n\nPirro, who in March took a two-week absence from hosting duties after she made Islamophobic comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), also touted the replacement conspiracy theory on Fox Business\u2019 \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d on Tuesday, per progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America.\n\nPirro\u2019s Fox News colleagues, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, also have a history of echoing the idea.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68ed93250000340089b3ac.jpeg?cache=ftjdoigr2e&ops=1778_1000"}
