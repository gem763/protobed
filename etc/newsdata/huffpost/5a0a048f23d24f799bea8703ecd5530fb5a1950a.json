{"title": "When Transgender Travelers Walk Into Scanners, Invasive Searches Sometimes Wait On The Other Side", "pub_date": "2019-08-27 13:14:28-04:00", "text": "This story was co-published with the Miami Herald.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2017, Olivia stepped into a full-body scanner at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nWhen she stepped out, a female Transportation Security Administration officer approached. On the scanner\u2019s screen was an outline of a human body with the groin highlighted. The officer told Olivia that because of something the scanner had detected, a pat-down would be necessary.\n\nAs a transgender woman, Olivia, 36, had faced additional TSA scrutiny before. On those occasions, a manual search at the checkpoint had been enough to assure TSA officers that there wasn\u2019t a weapon or explosive hidden in her undergarments.\n\nThis encounter with the TSA went very differently.\n\nAnnie Flanagan Olivia, a transgender woman, filed a civil rights complaint with the Transportation Security Administration in 2017 after a troubling encounter at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nAfter patting down Olivia and testing her hands for explosive residue, the officer said that she still couldn\u2019t clear Olivia to board her flight and that a further search would be required.\n\nOlivia was led to a private room where, she said, the officer patted her down again, running her hands down Olivia\u2019s legs and over her groin.\n\n\u201cI told her: \u2018If the issue is what you are feeling, let me tell you what this is. It is my penis,\u2019\u201d said Olivia, who agreed to be interviewed only if she were identified by her middle name because she fears people will treat her differently if they know she is transgender.\n\nSoon after, three other TSA officers, all of them women and at least one of them a supervisor, entered the room, Olivia said.\n\nTSA rules require that passengers be searched by officers of the same gender as they present. But, according to Olivia, the TSA supervisor told her that she would have to be patted down by a male officer.\n\nAfter Olivia refused to be searched by a man, the officers told her that because she was not consenting to a search, she could not board her flight and would be escorted out of the terminal.\n\nOlivia said she started crying and pleaded with the officers. \u201cCan I just show you?\u201d she recalled asking them.\n\nTSA officers aren\u2019t supposed to allow passengers to remove undergarments. But Olivia said the officers in the room with her did not object when Olivia pulled her ruffled, black and white skirt and underwear down to her ankles.\n\nOlivia was then cleared to continue to her gate.\n\nA Flawed System\n\nWhat happened that day traumatized Olivia, who is now fearful of airports, and what she experienced reflects the worst fears of many transgender travelers, who say the TSA is failing them.\n\nShortcomings in the technology used by the TSA and insufficient training of the agency\u2019s staff have made transgender and gender nonconforming travelers particularly vulnerable to invasive searches at airport checkpoints, interviews and a review of documents and data shows.\n\nThe TSA says that it is committed to treating all travelers equally and respectfully. But while the agency has known about the problems for several years, it still struggles to ensure the fair treatment of transgender and gender nonconforming people.\n\nTo understand the extent of the problem, ProPublica reviewed publicly available complaint data from the TSA\u2019s website and asked transgender travelers to provide accounts of their experiences at airport checkpoints.\n\nThe review, which covered civil rights complaints filed from January 2016 through April 2019, found that 5%, or 298 complaints, were related to screening of transgender people, even though they are estimated to make up slightly less than 1% of the population.\n\nThis may understate the proportion of complaints from transgender travelers. When Olivia contacted the TSA, her complaint was filed in a different category \u2014 a catchall classification called \u201csex/gender/gender identity - not transgender.\u201d That category accounts for 15% of the civil rights complaints in the period examined by ProPublica, but the TSA said it did not have a more specific breakdown of these complaints and could not say how many were, like Olivia\u2019s, related in some way to gender identity and screening. ProPublica filed a Freedom of Information Act request in April seeking information about each complaint in those categories, but the agency has not yet provided any response.\n\nWhen ProPublica asked transgender and gender nonconforming people to tell us about their experiences, we received 174 responses, many of them recounting humiliating treatment after being flagged by full-body scanners for additional scrutiny. Of those people, only 14 said they filed a complaint with the TSA. Many of those who did not file complaints said they didn\u2019t know how, were afraid of outing themselves or didn\u2019t want to relive the experience.\n\nSome of the travelers who responded to ProPublica said they were asked by TSA officers to lift clothing to show private parts of their bodies or were pressured to expose their genitals so that TSA officers would allow them to pass through the security checkpoint.\n\n\u201cTransgender people have complained of profiling and other bad experiences of traveling while trans since TSA\u2019s inception and have protested its invasive body scanners since they were first introduced in 2010,\u201d said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality, or NCTE.\n\nThe TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, was created in an overhaul of transportation security after the 2001 terrorist attacks, with the mission to prevent similar tragedies. The agency, replacing a patchwork of private security providers, initially used metal detectors, which had been standard at checkpoints for years. But after a passenger attempted to blow up a plane in 2009 with plastic explosives hidden in his underwear, the agency began using full-body scanners.\n\nThe new scanners were designed to detect potential threats that are not necessarily metal. But TSA officers can\u2019t tell by looking at the monitor whether the machine is detecting a weapon, or as in Olivia\u2019s case, a body part that the scanner was not programmed to associate with a woman.\n\nSince implementing the scanning technology, the agency has grappled with privacy and discrimination issues. Like the transgender and gender nonconforming communities, people with disabilities, people who wear religious head coverings and women of color, whose hairstyles trigger the body scanners to alarm more frequently, have raised concerns about profiling and invasive screening.\n\nJenny Burke, the TSA\u2019s press secretary, said the screening is done \u201cwithout regard to a person\u2019s race, color, sex, gender identity, national origin, religion or disability.\u201d\n\nIn February, the agency rolled out a new online transgender awareness training, mandatory for its 43,000 screeners, and is studying options for better technology, Burke said.\n\nBut advocates and some lawmakers said the improvements have taken too long for a federal agency that interacts with the public more than many others. On an average day, TSA officers screen more than 2 million people and manually search many of them.\n\n\u201cFor many, TSA is not just the public face of government \u2014 but its hands, too. Its success as a security agency depends upon the trust and compliance of a diverse public,\u201d Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said during his opening statement at a Homeland Security Committee hearing in June.\n\nTransgender people have faced growing uncertainty about whether their civil rights are protected by the federal government. In May, the Trump administration announced plans to roll back protections for transgender people under nondiscrimination laws. Earlier last year, the administration barred transgender people from serving in the military. As ProPublica reported last year, some states bar transgender people from obtaining a state-issued ID that matches their gender presentation unless they provide proof they\u2019ve had surgery.\n\nFalse Alarms\n\nMost of the incidents ProPublica reviewed for this story started with a body scanner issuing an alarm.\n\nBefore a person steps into the full body scanner at an airport, a TSA officer must register the person\u2019s gender, pressing a pink button for a female or a blue button for a male. Generally, the officers make the decision in seconds, based on a person\u2019s appearance.\n\nThe body scanner is programmed to look for penises on passengers scanned as male and breasts on passengers scanned as female. If the officer selects the female button and the machine detects something in the passenger\u2019s groin area \u2014 like in Olivia\u2019s case \u2014 it could interpret a body part as a potential threat, issuing an alarm.\n\nProPublica also spoke to several cisgender women who said they were flagged for additional scrutiny after a TSA officer scanned them as male, causing their breasts to trigger the alarm. (\u201cCisgender\u201d describes someone who identifies with the sex they were assigned at birth, meaning they are not transgender.) The women told ProPublica that they believed the officers scanned them as male because they had short hair or, in one case, because they were wearing baggy clothes.\n\nPeter Neffenger, who served as TSA administrator for the last 18 months of the Obama administration, said he heard again and again about the anxiety brought on by the scanners.\n\n\u201cAs many in the transgender community explained to me, it\u2019s one of the most stressful parts of the screening process for them,\u201d Neffenger said.\n\nIn September 2018, Terra Fox, a transgender woman, was at the airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on her way to a conference in Orlando, Florida. When she walked through the body scanner, the machine showed a yellow box over her groin.\n\nFox said she told the officers at the checkpoint that she is a transgender woman and that the machine was merely detecting her genitals.\n\nFox asked to be patted down by a woman, but the female officers near her refused to do it.\n\nAccording to Fox, two male officers brought her to a private room and instructed her to pull down her leggings and show them her genitals. She complied, but the screening lasted so long that she missed her flight. She said the experience has taken a toll on her.\n\n\u201cEvery time I travel, I have to cry and feel humiliated,\u201d she said.\n\nFox has to travel for work frequently and said she doesn\u2019t have the option of avoiding airports.\n\nAdria Malcolm Terra Fox says she was instructed to pull down her leggings during a TSA search at the airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nAllister McGuire, a transgender man who lives on Long Island, N.Y., said he didn\u2019t fly for five years after an experience in the St. Louis Lambert International Airport in 2014. McGuire was taken to a private room after the body scanner went off, displaying a yellow patch on his chest.\n\n\u201cI was very nervous,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cI did not feel safe.\u201d\n\nThe two male officers in the room told McGuire to remove his chest binder, a cloth undershirt some trans men and gender nonconforming people use to flatten their chests, and then lifted each of his breasts with their hands, McGuire said. He was eventually allowed to leave, but he said he immediately had to take anxiety medication.\n\nMcGuire said he did not file a complaint.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, McGuire wondered: \u201cIf I was coming through as a woman, would [the officers] be touching me like that?\u201d\n\nBurke, the TSA press secretary, said that the agency does not conduct strip searches, but that travelers may be required to \u201cadjust clothing\u201d during the pat-downs. The agency didn\u2019t respond to detailed questions about the allegations made by Fox and McGuire.\n\nNeffenger said that during his time as TSA\u2019s administrator, officers were not supposed to ask people to take off their clothes during a screening. But he acknowledged that it was difficult to keep such an enormous workforce consistently trained.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you said you discovered that people have asked people to undress,\u201d Neffenger told ProPublica. \u201cIt\u2019s a big organization; it\u2019s got a lot of turnover.\u201d\n\nThe overall attrition rate for the TSA officers is 17%, which is roughly in line with the federal workforce, according to a report this year by the inspector general for DHS. But officers leave the TSA voluntarily at a higher rate than other federal employees, according to the report, which said \u201cretention and training challenges are contributing factors to airport security weaknesses.\u201d\n\nNeffenger spent 33 years serving in the U.S. Coast Guard before being appointed in 2015 to lead the TSA. He arrived amid fallout from damning revelations about the agency. A leaked government report showed that TSA officers had failed to detect nearly all weapons and explosives smuggled through by DHS investigators during a secret test.\n\nNeffenger said his immediate focus as administrator was to develop a nationwide training program. It was a challenging task, he said, because the intrusive nature of the screening process will inevitably make both passengers and officers uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cPat-downs are, by definition, invasive,\u201d Neffenger said. \u201cWhat [TSA officers] are asked to do is stuff people don\u2019t like to do.\u201d\n\nPublic Comments\n\nTSA officers would need to do fewer pat-downs if the agency had better technology.\n\nThe agency uses a machine called a millimeter wave scanner at nearly every airport in the U.S. The machines, manufactured by L3Harris Technologies, rely on an algorithm to analyze images of a passenger\u2019s body and identify any threats concealed by the person\u2019s clothes.\n\nThe TSA has spent about $110 million deploying the machines, which cost about $150,000 each, according to a government report.\n\nSince the TSA began deploying body scanners at airports, LGBTQ advocates have expressed concern that the new screening procedures would disproportionately affect transgender travelers.\n\nIn a letter to then-TSA Administrator John Pistole in December 2010, NCTE, the Transgender Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights described two incidents in which transgender men were interrogated by TSA officers because their bodies looked different in the scanners than what the officers expected. The organizations urged Pistole to take immediate action to stop discrimination against transgender people. In a written response, Pistole said the agency was \u201cworking hard to respond to the concerns of the traveling public.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, sued DHS in response to the TSA\u2019s decision to make body scanners the primary screening system at airports. EPIC argued that the agency should have given the public an opportunity to comment on the technology before it was implemented. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of EPIC in 2011, though the TSA didn\u2019t begin accepting comments until 2013.\n\n\u201cThey are now blaming the scanners when part of the rule-making process is to surface these kinds of issues,\u201d said Jeramie Scott, director of EPIC\u2019s Domestic Surveillance Project.\n\nBurke said the agency procures equipment, such as body scanners, that can accommodate the largest demographic possible. Burke said the TSA does not develop its own technology and solicits private companies to develop scanners that meet the agency\u2019s needs.\n\nNeffenger said talking to transgender people and advocates helped him realize that the agency had to do better.\n\n\u201cYou really have to design a system that is as close to 100% as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe TSA and L3Harris Technologies did not respond to questions about how the scanner\u2019s algorithm processes images to determine threats. (In June, L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation merged to form L3Harris, which has about 48,000 employees and is a key government contractor.)\n\nIn a written statement, Jennifer Barton, a spokeswoman for L3Harris, said details about the company\u2019s research and development are confidential. She also said the company is working \u201cwith the TSA\u201d on new technology and products that meet the agency\u2019s \u201cevolving requirements and the needs of all passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of ensuring that security scanning equipment accommodate all gender identities, and that is why (the company) is developing technology that moves away from the current male/female imagery and will safely screen passengers without the use of gender-specific images,\u201d Barton wrote.\n\nBarton didn\u2019t respond to follow-up questions about when the technology would be ready for use at airports.\n\nBeyond Technology\n\nWhile Olivia was searched in the private room in Fort Lauderdale, her fiancee, Marguerite, was waiting on one of the benches near the security checkpoint. Olivia, a trial lawyer, and Marguerite, a school psychologist, had been dating for a year and were planning to marry that winter. The couple were on their way to New York for Marguerite\u2019s brother\u2019s wedding, and Marguerite was worried that they might miss their flight.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could call the police,\u201d Marguerite said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what my rights were.\u201d\n\nOlivia said she is used to people questioning her appearance \u2014 and even her right to exist \u2014 because she is transgender. Showing her naked body to TSA officers, however, was a level of invasiveness she wasn\u2019t prepared for.\n\n\u201cThe whole weekend of the wedding I replayed the situation in my mind. It ruined the trip,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a lawyer I am used to being in control of the situation, but that situation just completely went off the rails.\u201d\n\nDays after the incident, she filed a detailed complaint with the TSA. Her account describes actions, such as the directive that she submit to being searched by a man, that would violate TSA policy.\n\nAnnie Flanagan \u201cAs a lawyer I am used to being in control of the situation, but that situation just completely went off the rails,\u201d Olivia said.\n\nBurke, the TSA press secretary, said transgender people are supposed to be patted down by an officer of the same gender that they present.\n\nA TSA officer, who has worked as a screener since 2016 and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the officers should not have allowed Olivia to expose herself.\n\n\u201cThe moment she [Olivia] said she was going to take her clothes off, they had to say: No, we can\u2019t allow that. That is completely against SOP [standard operating procedure],\u201d the TSA officer said.\n\nOlivia said if she\u2019d known she had the right to bring a witness into the private room, Marguerite would have been there with her.\n\nSix weeks after she filed her complaint, on Oct. 31, 2017, Olivia received a letter from the TSA\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and Liberties, Ombudsman and Traveler Engagement. The letter shared the conclusions of the agency\u2019s investigation into the incident: \u201cOur review to date does finds [sic] that the TSA officers and staff did follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in the overall screening and the pat down procedures,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the letter, the agency\u2019s investigation involved \u201ca collection and review of eye-witness statements, close circuit television footage, and any other evidence tending to prove or disprove a traveler\u2019s factual allegations.\u201d\n\nThe two-page letter didn\u2019t address Olivia\u2019s claim that she had to expose her genitals to TSA officers.\n\n\u201cMy complaint came back and it was not at all what I said had happened,\u201d Olivia said.\n\nEventually, Olivia filed a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request for the evidence the TSA said it reviewed to investigate her allegations. Her request was denied.\n\n\u201cNobody called me, nobody did anything, they completely blocked my FOIA request,\u201d she said.\n\nProPublica also submitted a FOIA request for documents related to the investigation into the incident, along with a privacy waiver signed by Olivia to allow ProPublica to access her records. The agency has yet to provide ProPublica with any of the requested records, citing a backlog in FOIA requests.\n\nProPublica reviewed the narrative that Olivia included in her original complaint to the TSA, as well as photos she took of the officers involved and an audio recording she made at the end of the incident, to corroborate her description of events.\n\nThe agency told ProPublica that it does not have cameras in private screening rooms and did not respond to questions about the incident or Olivia\u2019s complaint.\n\nProPublica contacted one of the officers at her home in South Florida, but she declined to comment. We could not locate the other two officers.\n\nDeficient Training\n\nTSA officers and supervisors started taking a 30-minute online course titled \u201cTransgender Awareness Training\u201d in February. The course is supposed to teach employees how to interact with transgender people respectfully, according to a one-page summary of the training provided by the TSA.\n\nBurke said that the agency would not provide a copy of the training materials because they are \u201csensitive security information.\u201d\n\nProPublica reviewed hundreds of posts and comments from a private Facebook group for current and former TSA employees called \u201cTSA Breakroom.\u201d The conversations in the group, which has more than 18,000 members and is not administered by the TSA, shed some light on the content of the training.\n\nIn a series of discussions earlier this year, group members, some of them withholding their names, complained about the program. One of the anonymous posts said the course in the Online Learning Center, or OLC, instructed officers to introduce themselves to passengers by stating their name and the pronouns the officer uses.\n\nProPublica A post in a private Facebook group for current and former TSA employees called \u201cTSA Breakroom.\u201d\n\nThis kind of introduction is common in the LGBTQ community, but dozens of group members wrote that they didn\u2019t understand the instructions or would not be willing to introduce themselves that way.\n\nMany group members wrote that they worried passengers would be upset if officers asked them about their gender identity.\n\n\u201cI shook my head through that whole dang course,\u201d one member commented in April 2019. \u201cSomeone will throat punch me if I say that stupid shit.\u201d\n\nProPublica A comment from April 2019 about a transgender awareness training course, posted in a private Facebook group for current and former TSA employees.\n\nOther group members wrote that the training didn\u2019t address the fundamental problem that the scanners have only male and female options.\n\n\u201cI got a pink button and blue button. Which one you want?\u201d one group member wrote.\n\nThe current TSA officer who spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity said that she came up with her own ways to screen transgender passengers.\n\n\u201cI flip a coin in my head and hit a button, wait for the person to walk out of the scan, point at the screen and ask the person: Did I scan you right?\u201d the officer said. \u201cIt is sort of a discreet way of asking.\u201d If the passenger\u2019s answer is no, the officer asks the passenger to walk through the scanner again and hits the other button.\n\nAnother TSA employee, who has worked for the agency for over a decade and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the gender buttons are stressful for both passengers and officers.\n\n\u201cA lot of the traveling public already hate us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to offend people by [scanning them] wrong.\u201d\n\nSome members of Congress have tried to address discrimination against transgender people at TSA checkpoints through legislation. In 2018, Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., introduced the Screening With Dignity Act, which proposed funding for TSA training and education and a feasibility study for retrofitting or replacing the millimeter wave scanners. The bill died in the Homeland Security Committee and has not been reintroduced this year.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that TSA needs to reassess its technological capabilities and improve its screening procedures to be more inclusive,\u201d said Rice, who was the district attorney for Nassau County, on Long Island, before being elected to Congress. \u201cNo one should have to go through airport security scared that they might be humiliated, discriminated against or outed.\u201d\n\nIn a 2015 survey of transgender Americans, NCTE found that of respondents who had gone through airport security in the last year, 43% had a problem at the checkpoint related to being transgender.\n\nMany transgender people fear interacting with law enforcement in any setting. According to the NCTE survey, 57% of respondents said they would be afraid to ask the police for help.\n\nFox, the transgender woman who said she was asked to expose her genitals at the airport in Albuquerque, said her boyfriend encouraged her to file a complaint, but she decided against it.\n\n\u201cDealing with the legal system is scary,\u201d Fox said.\n\nLasting Trauma\n\nWhen Olivia left the private room where she was searched at the Fort Lauderdale airport, she ran to Marguerite, who was waiting for her on the bench, and wept.\n\n\u201cCalm down, calm down, get your stuff together,\u201d Marguerite can be heard telling Olivia in the audio recording Olivia took on her phone near the end of the incident.\n\nAnnie Flanagan Olivia and her wife, Marguerite. When they have to fly, Marguerite prints out the screening procedures from the TSA\u2019s website in case Olivia is stopped again.\n\nFrom the time Olivia stepped in the body scanner to the time she was allowed to head to her flight, the encounter spanned just 20 minutes. But it\u2019s been impossible to forget.\n\nMarguerite and Olivia, who married last year, have traveled a few times since the September 2017 trip. Marguerite prints the screening procedures from the TSA website and keeps a copy in her purse, in case she has to show it to a TSA officer.\n\nEach time they travel, Olivia panics as she approaches an airport checkpoint.\n\n\u201cI feel my heart speed up. I start thinking: It is going to happen again, it is going to happen again, it is going to happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nThis May, while flying back to Florida from North Carolina, a TSA officer asked Olivia to step aside. The airport body scanner issued an alarm in her groin area. The officer patted her over her jeans and allowed her to head to her flight.\n\nWhen she left the checkpoint, Olivia ran to Marguerite, who held her as she cried.\n\nEste reportaje es publicado conjuntamente con el Miami Herald, que tradujo al espa\u00f1ol una versi\u00f3n de esta historia.
