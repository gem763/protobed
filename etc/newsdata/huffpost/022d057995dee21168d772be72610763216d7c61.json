The man behind such films as \u201cBatman Forever\u201d and \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d told Vulture he\u2019s had sex with up to 20,000 partners.\n\nThe article\u2019s author, Andrew Goldman, remarked that the figure \u2015 which Schumacher eventually put between 10,000 and 20,000 \u2015 is \u201creally amazing.\u201d To which Schumacher responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not for a gay male, because it\u2019s available.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had sex with famous people, and I\u2019ve had sex with married people, and they go to the grave,\u201d he said in the interview, posted Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed and told about anybody who gives me the favor of sharing a bed with me.\u201d\n\nSantiago Felipe/Getty Images Joel Schumacher\n\n\u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d filmmaker said when the AIDS epidemic broke out in the 1980s, he was surprised to test negative and took measures to protect himself. But there were risks.\n\n\u201cI used condoms,\u201d said Schumacher, who turned 80 on Thursday. \u201cBut condoms broke. And there was a lot of drug taking, a lot going on then. It was a way to deal with the loss, I think, of so many people I loved, or liked, or had affection for, or admired.\u201d\n\nSchumacher\u2019s claim puts him in the company of the late basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, who boasted in a 1991 memoir that he slept with 20,000 different women.\n\nTroubled former NBA star Lamar Odom recently said he had sex with 2,000 women \u2015 but appeared to use the number as more of a cautionary tale to discuss his downward spiral of drug abuse and infidelity.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d679c82250000340088e439.png?ops=1778_1000"}
