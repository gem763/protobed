{"title": "Trump Reacts To Justice Department Finding James Comey Violated FBI Policy", "pub_date": "2019-08-29 14:16:14-04:00", "text": "President Donald Trump on Thursday welcomed parts of a report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that concluded former FBI Director James Comey had violated FBI policies in his handling of certain memos regarding his interactions with the president.\n\nWhile ignoring parts of the report that refute his own repeated claims, Trump said the IG\u2019s findings leave Comey \u201cthoroughly disgraced and excoriated\u201d:\n\nPerhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General\u2019s Report. He should be ashamed of himself! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham echoed the president\u2019s falsehoods in an official statement Thursday afternoon, again ignoring that the report found Comey did not leak classified information to the press, contrary to Trump\u2019s claims.\n\nHere\u2019s the statement, in full:\n\nJames Comey is a proven liar and leaker. The Inspector General\u2019s report shows Comey violated the most basic obligations of confidentiality that he owed to the United States Government and to the American people, \u201cin order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\u201d Because Comey shamefully leaked information to the press \u2014 in blatant violation of FBI policies \u2014 the Nation was forced to endure the baseless politically motivated, two-year witch hunt. Comey disgraced himself and his office to further a personal political agenda, and this report further confirms that fact.\n\nIn statements of his own on Twitter, Comey was quick to note that the IG report absolved him of sharing classified information with the media \u2015 a claim that had been regularly amplified by the GOP and the president himself.\n\nThe report \u201cfound no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media,\u201d Comey wrote, quoting the IG\u2019s findings:\n\nDOJ IG \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\" I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u201csorry we lied about you\u201d would be nice. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\nThe report directly refutes Trump\u2019s opposing claims, in which he regularly smeared Comey with baseless charges:\n\nJames Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and..... \u2014 Donald J.
