He said if he had gone through the process, he wouldn\u2019t have been permitted to report it.\n\n\u201cTonight, we are retracting the story,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the information is inaccurate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is, we do know it wasn\u2019t ready for broadcast, and for that I apologize.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted earlier:\n\nLast night I made an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president\u2019s finances that didn\u2019t go through our rigorous verification and standards process. I shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air. I will address the issue on my show tonight. \u2014 Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) August 28, 2019\n\nThe Tuesday night segment in question involved O\u2019Donnell telling viewers that Russian oligarchs had co-signed Trump\u2019s loans from Deutsche Bank, a report he teased on Twitter too. He stressed the story had not been confirmed by NBC News, was based on a single anonymous source and still needed to be verified to determine if it was true.\n\n\u201cI have not seen any documentation from Deutsche Bank that supports this and verifies this,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said on the air Tuesday night, according to CNN. \u201cThis is just a single source who has revealed that to me.\u201d\n\nThe unconfirmed report prompted Trump\u2019s lawyers to send NBC a letter demanding a retraction.\n\nJust in: Attorney for @realDonaldTrump sends demand for retraction, corrctn, and apology to @nbc over segment of @Lawrence program last nite in which he said \u201cRussian oligarchs\u201d co-signed Deutsche Bank loans to Trump. Letter says that statement is \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d Letter: pic.twitter.com/HY0ZRAES5i \u2014 Paul Farhi (@farhip) August 28, 2019", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67073f250000bf078887b4.jpeg?cache=48jbh0j0a1&ops=1778_1000"}
