Someone took a video of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor and the singer chatting and holding hands \u2014 and caught Turner excitedly saying to Steinfeld, \u201cI know, what the fuck? I\u2019m a wife!\u201d\n\n\"I KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I'M A WIFE\" WE STAN SOPHIE TURNER. pic.twitter.com/EMWD8Epvce \u2014 fabi. (@JoeTakesMyHeart) August 27, 2019\n\nThe exchange is pretty cute, considering Steinfeld is at least part of the reason Turner is a wife.\n\nDuring an interview on Nova 96.9\u2019s Smallzy\u2019s Surgery show in January 2018, Steinfeld revealed that she helped make magic happen for Turner and singer Joe Jonas in 2016.\n\n\u201cI mean, I will say, I did get that text from Sophie being like, \u2018So tell me about Joe,\u2019 and I was like \u2018Go for it!\u2019\u201d said Steinfeld, who is a good friend of Turner\u2019s and had previously collaborated with Jonas (Steinfeld and Jonas\u2019 band DNCE worked together on her song \u201cRock Bottom\u201d).\n\nTurner and Jonas were engaged by October 2017 and married at Las Vegas\u2019 Little White Wedding Chapel following the 2019 Billboard Music Awards on May 1, 2019.\n\nThe pair had a more formal wedding a month later at a French chateau among friends and family.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d66a036250000320073695a.png?ops=1778_1000"}
