{"title": "Madeleine Westerhout Out As Trump's Personal Assistant: Reports", "pub_date": "2019-08-29 22:38:57-04:00", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, is no longer part of the administration as of Thursday, according to reports.\n\nThe 27-year-old\u2019s sudden resignation reportedly came after the president discovered that she shared details about the Trump family and Oval Office operations at a recent off-the-record dinner with reporters in New Jersey, according to a New York Times report that cited two anonymous sources familiar with the departure. Politico later confirmed the exit.\n\nWesterhout was reportedly deemed a \u201cseparated employee\u201d immediately after Trump learned of her actions and would not be allowed to return on Friday to the White House, the Times reported.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the director of Oval Office operations\u2019 departure. Westerhout\u2019s desk sat outside the Oval Office since the first day of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the Times.\n\nBefore her job as the president\u2019s gatekeeper, Westerhout was an assistant to Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, ProPublica reported. At the same time, she appeared in the public sphere in 2016 as the \u201cgreeter\u201d for important figures visiting the president-elect at Trump Tower, according to The Washington Post.\n\nPrior to that, Westerhout interned for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, volunteered for then-state Sen. John Kuhn (R-S.C.) and interned for then-Rep. John Campbell (R-Calif.), according to the Charleston Post and Courier.\n\nPolitico reported that many officials from Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign were allegedly cautious of Westerhout because she joined the Trump transition from the RNC instead of being an original loyalist to the president. Other RNC alums that joined Trump\u2019s administration only to leave are former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former press secretary Sean Spicer and former deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh.\n\nAccording to White House records, Westerhout was making $130,000 a year as both the \u201cexecutive assistant to the president\u201d and the \u201cspecial assistant to the president,\u201d the latter a position the Post says ranks below both White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former deputy press secretary Raj Shah.\n\nWhen veteran journalist Bob Woodward tried to interview the president for his book last year by going through Conway and Shah, Trump told him he should have gone through Westerhout instead.\n\n\u201cDid you speak to Madeleine?\u201d Trump asked Woodward, according to the Post\u2019s transcript of the August 2018 conversation between the two, to which the journalist replied no.\n\n\u201cMadeleine is the key,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s the secret.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6886182500004e00896fa7.jpeg?cache=rtbbvbjywt&ops=1778_1000"}
