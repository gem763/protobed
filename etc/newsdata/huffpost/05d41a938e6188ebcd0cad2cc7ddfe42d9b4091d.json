Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tried to be the women\u2019s rights candidate for the Me Too era. But the only Me Too issue anyone wanted to talk about involved just one man: the former senator from Minnesota, Al Franken.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, after missing the cutoff to qualify for the September Democratic debate, Gillibrand dropped her bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\nFamously, Gillibrand was the first senator to call for Franken\u2019s resignation in December 2017. The popular Democrat was facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct at the height of the Me Too era.\n\nShe\u2019s been fielding Franken questions ever since.\n\nConsider, just last week, Gillibrand held a town hall on reproductive rights in Missouri, a battleground for abortion rights. No national media covered the event. Two days later, however, the New York Times\u2019 podcast \u201cThe Daily\u201d devoted an entire segment to Gillibrand \u2015 nearly 30 minutes centered entirely on what transpired with Franken and whether she had any regrets about it.\n\nShe was asked about Franken in national interviews at least 24 times this year, according to a campaign aide.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s campaign failed for a host of reasons \u2015 the field was crowded and competitive and she just didn\u2019t have the big breakout moments of some of her rivals. Nor did she come into the race with national name recognition.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth looking at Gillibrand\u2019s exit through the lens of the platform she tried to run on \u2015 women\u2019s rights and gender equality. Her campaign was something of a referendum on the Me Too era, and a test of the limits of what a female candidate is allowed to be in 2020.\n\nA Powerful Woman Still Sparks Anxiety\n\nThe political world is still having a sad and self-reinforcing argument about \u201celectability\u201d and whether the country is \u201cready\u201d for a woman president.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to look at what happened with Gillibrand and see that there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety around the idea of a truly powerful woman \u2015 especially one who is willing to stand up to a powerful man.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re treading on a lot of deeply entrenched misogyny right now,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL ProChoice America. \u201cWomen who stick their necks out to challenge the entrenched systems that benefit men are rarely rewarded for it personally.\u201d\n\nHogue emphatically disagreed that Gillibrand\u2019s campaign was any kind of barometer for women\u2019s rights more broadly. In fact, she sees 2020 as a crucial moment for women.\n\n\u201cThe election will be studied as one that was completely pivotal for the conversation about women\u2019s status in American society. There\u2019s no question,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just because we have five women running. It\u2019s everything that came before it.\u201d\n\nHogue listed the emergence of Me Too, the fight over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, the assault on reproductive rights, for starters.\n\nGillibrand didn\u2019t break through for many of the same reasons most of these Democratic contenders aren\u2019t polling well, Hogue said. In a large field, candidates without a national brand are struggling. Gillibrand is a \u201cretail politician\u201d who built power locally and was at a disadvantage.\n\nRebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist, put it bluntly. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t the best candidate,\u201d she said.\n\nFor voters who care about electing a woman, there are plenty of options right now. \u201cWith a field of this many women, I think it was hard for Gillibrand to talk about coming from off the sidelines when so many women were off the sidelines already,\u201d said Katz, referring to the name of the New York senator\u2019s dormant political committee, devoted to electing women.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gillibrand said she\u2019d revive the group. \u201cWe have to defeat President Trump, flip the Senate and elect women up and down the ballot,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Odds Were Low From The Get-Go\n\nEven without Franken hovering over her campaign, Gillibrand likely didn\u2019t have a shot.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the front-runners, when you look at their records, even absent calling for Franken\u2019s resignation, it\u2019s hard to see how she\u2019d make it into the top tier,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, a political science professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe Franken incident, if anything, kept Gillibrand in the conversation, Lawless added. The media was always going to be fascinated by what happened. A powerful woman taking down a powerful man is irresistibly interesting news.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a powerful man taking down a powerful man, then it\u2019s like, \u2018Eh, it\u2019s a Monday,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nNearly two years ago, not long after The New York Times published its Harvey Weinstein expose, coming out against Franken looked like a winning political move.\n\nRepublicans were the party of sexual assault, with Donald Trump at the helm. Roy Moore, accused of preying on young girls, was running for one of Alabama\u2019s Senate seats. To distinguish the party, the Democrats had to go after Franken. Nearly three dozen Democratic senators joined Gillibrand\u2019s call for his resignation.\n\nSince then, Me Too has faded somewhat from the political conversation.\n\n\u201cThe problem is it\u2019s two years later and the political environment has changed. I think the discussion around Me Too and sexual harassment has changed as well,\u201d said Lawless.\n\nOf course, there was an obsession over the \u201cfall\u201d of Franken \u2015 who, it\u2019s worth emphasizing, voluntarily resigned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about because it\u2019s really uncomfortable, but American people low-key don\u2019t like women,\u201d said Sean McElwee, co-founder of Data for Progress, a progressive nonprofit.\n\nMcElwee says the Franken incident was just one small reason for the New York senator\u2019s failure to launch. If voters did hear about it, their reaction was more of fatigue, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018women are still whining about this stuff\u2019 reaction from voters.\u201d\n\nWhere Is Me Too In The 2020 Race?\n\nThe 2020 race so far has been about a lot of issues: Trump, health care, the economy, climate change, even busing \u2015 a political issue from the 1970s \u2015 got its moment in the sun.\n\nMe Too? Not so much.\n\nSexual discrimination, harassment and assault haven\u2019t come up in the Democratic debates. (There was a single question about the pay gap in the first debate.)\n\nWhile there\u2019s little question the 2020 contenders are supporters of women\u2019s rights (Joe Biden\u2019s hair sniffing aside) there\u2019s been little substantive discussion over what that support looks like.\n\nWhat policy would best serve to ensure women are treated equally in the workplace?\n\nWhat should the consequences be for sexual harassers?\n\nWhat\u2019s the best policy to ensure that the workplace is free from discrimination?\n\nThere\u2019s been no back-and-forth on these issues.\n\n\u201cDemocrats made themselves the standard bearers on #MeToo issues \u2014 practically shoving Al Franken out of the Senate \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way their campaign to defeat Trump has played out so far,\u201d Alexi McCammond wrote last week in Axios.\n\nThat\u2019s actually not surprising. The Me Too era has triggered all kinds of anxiety about women taking on powerful men. A majority of men now say they\u2019re reluctant to even mentor or work with women, according to a recent survey.\n\nArguably, at this point, there\u2019s been more ink spilled over how men\u2019s lives have been \u201cruined\u201d by Me Too than discussion over the consequences women face when they speak up for themselves.\n\nA Crowded Field\n\nIn a field with several other female candidates, Gillibrand\u2019s pitch was even less likely to land. The 52-year-old senator initially centered her campaign on her identity as a mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom, I\u2019m going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I would fight for my own,\u201d she said on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d in January, announcing she was forming a presidential exploratory committee.\n\nBut she was outflanked on the mom strategy pretty quickly by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who drew a lot of attention the following month with a sweeping plan for child care. Warren expertly connected her policy to her experience as a young mother, recalling how her Aunt Bee swooped in at the last minute and offered to help her, Katz said.\n\nIn March, with the official launch of her campaign, Gillibrand pivoted away from the mom strategy and leaned in to a new slogan: \u201cBe Brave.\u201d The announcement was overshadowed by the release of the Mueller report. And the moniker also had the effect of calling up the Franken moment again.\n\nIn the end, there was little oxygen \u2015 or appetite \u2015 left for her to have a substantive conversation about sexual harassment or discrimination.\n\n\u201cReally owning sexual assault and harassment should\u2019ve been a positive, distinguishing factor [for Gillibrand],\u201d said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get there because we were so busy talking about the process that led to Al Franken resigning.\u201d\n\nYes, there is much to be excited about for women in politics. Women have brought new energy to the Democratic Party \u2015 there was the Women\u2019s March, the wave of congresswomen elected in 2018. Now, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination is Warren. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) will be on the debate stage in September.\n\nReproductive rights are on the agenda in a real and specific way, partly because Gillibrand took a hard-line stance on abortion early on.\n\n\u201cShe successfully pushed the entire field to commit to defending the civil rights of women,\u201d Meredith Kelly, Gillibrand\u2019s communications director, told HuffPost.\n\nGillibrand on Wednesday said she\u2019d ultimately endorse a Democratic candidate for president and stopped just short of telling The New York Times that candidate would be a woman.\n\n\u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67f55c2500005104743c1e.jpeg?cache=rv5rapezcg&ops=1778_1000"}
