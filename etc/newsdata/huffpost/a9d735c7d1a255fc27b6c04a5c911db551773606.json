Top police officials and Mayor Eric Garcetti promised a thorough investigation.\n\nA complaint about an incident at Las Perlas bar Friday was filed with police and detectives are investigating, said department spokesman Officer Jay Chaves.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles is a place where hate against any person, regardless of gender identity, is not tolerated. My office is in communication with @LAPDHQ about the incident at Las Perlas, and will ensure a proper investigation is completed,\u201d Garcetti said in a tweet.\n\nKhloe Rios, who recorded the video, said she and a group of colleagues from Bienestar Human Services, a nonprofit that focuses on health issues in Latino and LGBTQ communities, were having dinner when a straight couple approached them and started yelling slurs.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You guys are all men. You are not women. You don\u2019t belong here,\u2019\u201d Rios said.\n\nRios, a program manager at the nonprofit, said she and her friends ignored the comments but then the woman became more aggressive and spat at them, pushed her and slapped a colleague.\n\nThe group stood up and huddled together to protect each other and that\u2019s when security guards intervened and asked everyone to leave. They escorted the couple out but became aggressive with them, pushing and shoving them and even dragging one of her colleagues by the neck, she said.\n\n\u201cWe thought the security team was going to protect us but instead they threw us out like trash,\u201d Rios said.\n\nOutside, the couple continued to yell slurs at them and threatened to kill them, she said. The couple ran away when they saw police patrol cars approaching, she added.\n\n\u201cEvery single day I see trans women being harassed, being bullied and being discriminated. This was a horrible experience,\u201d Rios said. \u201cI knew I needed to record this to show how they treat us.\u201d\n\nCedd Moses, chief executive of Pouring With Heart, which owns the bar, said in a statement posted to the Las Perlas\u2019 Facebook page on Saturday the incident was \u201can escalated verbal altercation\u201d that led the manager to remove those patrons who didn\u2019t comply with a request to leave.\n\nAfter a protest outside the bar that prompted the bar to close Saturday night, Moses apologized to the transgender community and said the security company working at the bar would be replaced.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to working with the community and we are researching the right partner to help us move forward in the most positive way possible including staff and vendor training,\u201d he wrote in a statement Sunday.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6581c3250000320387936b.png?cache=5wxcz2jhsm&ops=1778_1000"}
