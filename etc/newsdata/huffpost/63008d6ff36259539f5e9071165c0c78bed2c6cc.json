Actor and singer Todrick Hall, a longtime Swift pal who co-stars in her \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d music video, says she just laughed off the awards show gaffe \u2015 not Travolta\u2019s first.\n\n\u201cI loved it,\u201d Hall said in a Wednesday interview on \u201cJerry O,\u201d Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s talk show. \u201cWe talked about it backstage, and Taylor thought it was hilarious.\u201d\n\nJolie, a \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran who also appears in the \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d video, captured the moment for posterity in a cheeky Instagram post Tuesday.\n\nIn his Wednesday chat with O\u2019Connell, Hall said the drag queen was, in fact, flattered by Travolta\u2019s confusion.\n\n\u201cJade Jolie has made quite the living performing ... at Play Nightclub, and she is a fantastic drag queen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody knows that she is like the Taylor Swift doppelg\u00e4nger. So I think that was like the highest compliment he could ever pay her.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, Hall elaborated on Swift\u2019s plan to rerecord songs from her first six albums after her catalog was acquired by megaproducer Scooter Braun in a controversial $300 million deal with her former record label.\n\n\u201cI think that [Braun] is a very powerful person, and I think what he\u2019s done in the music industry is undeniably amazing,\u201d said Hall, who is currently starring in Broadway\u2019s \u201cWaitress.\u201d \u201cBut I personally feel that was not the best move for him to do that. I felt like it was a little greedy. I just don\u2019t think that he\u2019s a great guy all around.\u201d\n\nThe actor and singer, who is gay, went on to suggest that Braun would be better served by trying to amplify marginalized voices in the music industry.\n\n\u201cI think that we need something to remind people and to inspire people and to encourage young artists who are queer, that are people of color, to come out and be able to be on the radio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he has the power to do that, and I have not seen him do it yet.\u201d\n\nCheck out Todrick Hall\u2019s \u201cJerry O\u201d interview below.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67c929250000710a7422f2.jpeg?cache=kf3wi2fltl&ops=1778_1000"}
