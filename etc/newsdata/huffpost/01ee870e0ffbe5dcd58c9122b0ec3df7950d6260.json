Greg Abbott said Thursday that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d in a fundraising letter calling to \u201cdefend Texas\u201d from illegal immigration just a day before the mass shooting in El Paso.\n\n\u201cI did get the chance to visit with the El Paso delegation and help them understand that mistakes were made and course correction has been made,\u201d Abbott said, speaking ahead of the meeting of the newly formed Texas Safety Commission.\n\nAbbott said he spoke with El Paso lawmakers about the letter and \u201cemphasized the importance of making sure that rhetoric will not be used in any dangerous way.\u201d\n\n\u2066@GovAbbott\u2069 concedes \u201cmistakes were made\u201d in writing letter to fundraisers warning of potential harm posed by undocumented migrants.

Police say the alleged gunman later admitted that he had targeted Mexicans with his rampage.\n\nIn his letter, first obtained by The Texas Signal, Abbott speaks of the need to \u201cDEFEND\u201d the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, capitalizing, bold-facing and underlining the word. It asks Republicans for contributions toward \u201cmy $1 billion plan ... to secure our border with Mexico.\u201d It also attacks Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as a \u201cradical socialist\u201d and calls House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u201creprobates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe national Democrat machine has made no secret of the fact that it hopes to \u2018turn Texas blue.\u2019 If they can do it in California, they can do it in Texas \u2014 if we let them,\u201d the governor wrote, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nHe ended: \u201cUnless you and I want liberals to succeed in their plan to transform Texas \u2014 and our entire country \u2014 through illegal immigration, this is a message we MUST send.\u201d\n\nThe letter surfaced last week in a report by the Tribune.\n\nThe Texas Democratic Party blasted Abbott\u2019s mailer as \u201cracist, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d and said the governor\u2019s comments Thursday did not constitute an apology.\n\n\u201cThe first step in solving a problem is admitting we have one. In that respect, this Texas Safety Commission meeting is a step in the right direction. However, let\u2019s be clear: Governor Abbott and the Republican Party\u2019s white supremacist rhetoric, like that seen in Abbott\u2019s fundraising mailer the day before the El Paso shooting, continues to be a major part of the problem,\u201d Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, said in a statement.\n\nHe added: \u201cGovernor Abbott refuses to apologize for this racist fundraising mailer and won\u2019t answer questions about ending his racist rhetoric immediately.\u201d\n\nAbbott has also faced a backlash in recent days for suggesting in a tweet that undocumented immigrant children should not be given a public education, as the Supreme Court decided in the 1982 case Plyler v. Doe.\n\nThe governor on Aug. 22 retweeted a Twitter user who griped that tax dollars are \u201cpaying for illegals to be educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle Plyler v. Doe,\u201d Abbott commented, noting that \u201cfederal courts rejected our lawsuit that the federal government should pay for that education cost.\u201d The Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas House of Representatives released a statement in response to the governor\u2019s tweet, calling his comment \u201cimmoral and infuriating.\u201d \u201cTexas reaps the social and economic rewards of educating ALL of its children,\u201d the group said. \u201cSince day one, Gov. Abbott has demonized the immigrant community fueling the widespread hate towards our Latino family.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6866ef2500004e00895c71.jpeg?cache=qmya22htrm&ops=1778_1000"}
