Did we mention she\u2019s not even 40 yet? Having moved from the Dominican Republic when she was just 10 years old, Pablo was deeply influenced by her new home, Miami, with its multicultural perspectives and global panorama. Like her beloved Miami, Pablo is vibrant, colorful and alive \u2014 she exudes enthusiasm and zeal for life.\n\nTo capture Pablo\u2019s courageous journey, we\u2019ve teamed up with Kia as part of our new Driving Forces series, which profiles Latinx creatives who have Kia\u2019s \u201cGive It Everything\u201d spirit, and are blending their passion for creativity, identity and community to uphold their bicultural identity with everything they do.\n\nKarli Evans\n\nPablo fell into the music industry by chance, though she doesn\u2019t see it as an accident. \u201cDominicans love music,\u201d she said. \u201cMusic is a part of our culture and it\u2019s part of our DNA.\u201d Even though a career in music hadn\u2019t been her original goal \u2014 her first job was in live television \u2014 her background in production melded perfectly with her love of music. \u201cThe minute I started doing it, I just fell in love with the whole music industry \u2014 putting together an album and promoting it,\u201d she said. \u201cI absolutely love being a part of something from the beginning.\u201d\n\nAs a high-level music executive, Pablo works with some of the biggest Latinx recording artists in the business and also fosters emerging talent across genres, including urban, pop and \u2014 her favorite \u2014 reggaeton. And it\u2019s a particularly exciting time for the industry \u2014 the popularity of Latinx music has grown exponentially in the United States over the last decade, even surpassing EDM and country music consumption in the last year. \u201cAll eyes are on the Latin culture right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are transcending boundaries, languages and different barriers. \u2026 It\u2019s so inspiring and so incredible to be a part of this movement.\u201d\n\nKarli Evans\n\nWhile in the midst of her prosperous career, Pablo was forced to reckon with a challenge that all of the success in the world couldn\u2019t have prepared her for. In 2017, at the age of 36, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which meant months of grueling treatment and heartache ahead. With an amazing support system, she was able to pick herself up immediately and fight for her life, but she soon realized that breast cancer was having a devastating toll on her community. \u201cIt really surprised me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the No. 1 cause of death in Latinas under 40, and it\u2019s because we don\u2019t talk about it enough.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, Pablo felt she had to act. She launched the #TeTocaTocarte (\u201cIt\u2019s time to touch yourself\u201d) campaign through social media to spread the word about the importance of self-exams, routine checkups and mammograms; within three days, her initial post went viral. She described the amount of support she received as \u201cmind-blowing.\u201d\n\nShortly after receiving her diagnosis, she was selected as the first Latina ambassador for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, for which she\u2019s been helping raise funds to provide free mammograms to women in need. Speaking about her two passions, music and advocacy, she said, \u201cBlending those two together isn\u2019t always easy, but I have no other choice because I\u2019m very lucky to be able to work in something that I\u2019m so passionate about; and I also am very lucky to be alive and healthy, and to be able to continue to fight for my health every single day.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about Pablo\u2019s inspiring story, or click here to view additional uplifting stories in Kia\u2019s Driving Forces series.\n\nKarli Evans\n\nFrom Kia:\n\nKia\u2019s new series, Driving Forces, profiles Latinx creatives like Clara Pablo who are constantly challenging themselves to achieve greatness, while simultaneously embracing their bicultural identity.
