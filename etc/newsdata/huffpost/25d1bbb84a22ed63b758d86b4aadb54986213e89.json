Respect to Robin Shou for portraying the OG LK. An unshakable source of pride for countless of us. Times are changing but the challenges keep coming. I\u2019m so ready for the fight. #MORTALKOMBAT! #LiuKang \u2014 LudiLin (@ludi_lin) August 17, 2019\n\nLin had previously expressed interest in playing a superhero, including the role of Shang-Chi. However he also told HN Entertainment that the role itself is a statement in Asian representation.\n\n\u201cWhoever gets the role, I already know that I already won because it\u2019ll be a huge step for representation and I\u2019ll know they\u2019ll do a good job on it, whoever gets cast,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told the outlet that comic books have always spoken to him as a minority because of the way in which many of the themes revolve around empowering those perceived as outsiders.\n\n\u201cComic books and superheroes represented something very important to me because they represented someone standing up for the outsider and standing up for the voices that are afraid to speak up,\u201d he said.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5b0c8e3f000033005a8771.jpeg?cache=oi3xvraft7&ops=1778_1000"}
