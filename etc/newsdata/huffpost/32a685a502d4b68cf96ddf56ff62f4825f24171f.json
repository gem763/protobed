Gracie and I having fun with Babs and Barry on our trip,\u201d wrote McGraw under the video.\n\nHill commented on the video, calling the pair \u201cmy loves\u201d and noting that Streisand \u201cwould be proud.\u201d\n\nGracie McGraw is the eldest of McGraw and Hill\u2019s three daughters. She announced earlier this month that she\u2019d be pursuing a career in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of wild that Nashville has been my home base for my whole life but it never really felt like home to me. Tomorrow I start my journey to the big LA baby!!!\u201d she wrote in an Instagram caption revealing the news.\n\nGracie seems to have always had her father\u2019s support. In 2017, the country music star told E! News during a screening of the film \u201cThe Shack\u201d that he thought his daughter \u201cshould make an album.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to talk her into it,\u201d McGraw said at the time.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019ll come to fruition soon.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d66aa04250000710a736f3d.png?ops=1778_1000"}
