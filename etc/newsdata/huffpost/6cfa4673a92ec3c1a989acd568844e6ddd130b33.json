{"title": "Troye Sivan Slams Reporter For Asking 'Invasive' Gay Sex Question", "pub_date": "2019-08-29 16:05:43-04:00", "text": "Troye Sivan fired back at a New Zealand-based journalist after an interview in which he was asked about his preferred sexual position appeared in print.\n\nThe article, which is in the September issue of Auckland\u2019s Express magazine, features rapid-fire questions in which the pop star offers his candid thoughts on everything from his favorite Netflix series to his celebrity crush, Shawn Mendes.\n\nThings appear to have taken an awkward turn, however, when reporter Matt Fistonich asked Sivan whether he preferred to be on the giving or receiving end of anal sex.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Sivan replied, \u201cOoo ... definitely passing!\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, he took a more critical stance on Twitter. He retweeted a fan who\u2019d posted screenshots of the Express interview and said he\u2019d found the question in bad taste overall.\n\nI thought about asking the interviewer about his absolute fave sex position after that last question, but then i remembered how wildly invasive, strange and innapropriate that would be. Didn\u2019t stop him though! https://t.co/mo80DziQrH \u2014 troye (@troyesivan) August 28, 2019\n\nHe then suggested he\u2019d opt for a different interview method in the future.\n\nNext time I\u2019ll just do a Twitter q&a \u2014 troye (@troyesivan) August 28, 2019\n\nNeither Fistonich nor Express\u2019 editor, Oliver Hall, immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nSivan, who is gay, has emerged as an LGBTQ icon for the millennial set in recent years and has never shied away from expressing his sexuality through his music and performances.\n\nMany interpreted \u201cBloom,\u201d the title track of Sivan\u2019s 2018 album, to be an ode to anal sex. The music video for another recent song, \u201cLucky Strike,\u201d saw him frolicking on a sun-drenched beach with a Speedo-clad male suitor.\n\nLast fall, he appeared alongside Lucas Hedges and Nicole Kidman in \u201cBoy Erased,\u201d playing a patient enrolled in a gay \u201cconversion therapy\u201d program.\n\nIn his series of Thursday tweets, the singer-songwriter elaborated further on why he felt Fistonich\u2019s question was inappropriate.\n\n\u201cI speak about sex in my music on my terms, when I\u2019m in control, and writing music that is going to be close to my heart forever,\u201d he said. \u201cI highly doubt anyone would ask any of my straight peers explicit questions about who does what to who in their relationship, no matter the content of their music. I don\u2019t think artists should have to expect to be asked about that when they show up to work in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in anal sex or any kind of sex,\u201d he added. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to talk about it over the phone to a complete stranger.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67e62025000032007432b1.jpeg?cache=r0nptlvqxy&ops=1778_1000"}
