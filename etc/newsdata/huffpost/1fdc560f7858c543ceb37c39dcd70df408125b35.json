{"title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Has A Blunt Correction For Trump\u2019s Puerto Rico Boast", "pub_date": "2019-08-29 00:34:44-04:00", "text": "President Donald Trump claims he\u2019s the \u201cbest thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico,\u201d the island he has repeatedly trashed during his presidency. But critics beg to differ, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian barreled down on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, Trump tweeted a series of attacks against its officials and called it \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, some 3,000 people died when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. The devastating storm was worsened by FEMA\u2019s multiple failures, as the agency itself concluded last year.\n\nYet, Trump has repeatedly defended his administration\u2019s response and attacked the island, and on Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez had had enough:\n\n3,000 Americans died on your watch.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not the best thing to happen to anybody but yourself. And even that\u2019s questionable. https://t.co/NEoWUFd9cC \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nOthers also slammed Trump over the bizarre claim:\n\nLet me get this straight: a hurricane could be bearing down on #PuertoRico that could cause unknown death and destruction yet this is the mindset of @realDonaldTrump towards his fellow citizens? This is not right. https://t.co/dUj96u900O \u2014 Ron Christie (@Ron_Christie) August 28, 2019\n\nChef Jose Andres helped feed people in the hurricane aftermath.\n\n\n\nYou threw paper towels. pic.twitter.com/KG1zUaGOrl \u2014 Santa Claus, CEO (@SantaInc) August 28, 2019\n\nToday, @realDonaldTrump, is a day to be doing what we can to help keep 3 million fellow Americans in Puerto Rico safe. Save your trashing of their leaders for another day. pic.twitter.com/lBUlVSWc5k \u2014 Gov. Bill Weld (@GovBillWeld) August 29, 2019\n\nI've never seen someone go so quickly from BLAMING the victims of hurricanes to patting himself on the back for his own miserable Katrina-like failure.\n\n\n\nHe is the WORST thing to happen to America in a long time.\n\n\n\nMaybe ever. \u2014 BrooklynDad_Defiant! (@mmpadellan) August 29, 2019\n\nTrump really has no idea that he's president of Puerto Rico \u2014 and therefore one of \"their\" politicians \u2014 does he? \u2014 john r stanton (@dcbigjohn) August 28, 2019\n\nReally, you're the best thing that's ever happened to #PuertoRico? I think your definition of \"best\" needs some work #CadetBoneSpurs. pic.twitter.com/hHGujMi3i5 \u2014 Sean B (@Lord_Other) August 28, 2019\n\n\"Their politicians\"??? You are aware that, as their president, that YOU are #PuertoRico's main 'politician', right? pic.twitter.com/472kuPiiD7 \u2014 Andrea Valentini \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 (@GypsySpirit46) August 28, 2019\n\nSo many paper towels...the best paper towels.
