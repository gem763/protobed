The press lies!\u201d she added.\n\nCuomo abruptly said he was ending the interview. Their exchange continued for another minute or so before the CNN host thanked McEnany for appearing on his show and said she was welcome to come back in the future.\n\nLemon, who had just watched the interview, told Cuomo he wasn\u2019t chastising him for having the Trump 2020 press secretary on his show.\n\n\u201cBut the audience gets nothing from her because she\u2019s not telling the truth,\u201d Lemon said.\n\nThose comments echoed sentiments Lemon has shared with Cuomo in the past about his interviewing another one of Trump\u2019s surrogates \u2015 Kellyanne Conway. Following an interview Cuomo had with Conway in March, Lemon argued that the White House counselor had no place on CNN.\n\n\u201cFor me, it feels beneath the dignity of this network to have someone who just constantly lies and misconstrues things,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd having someone on like that is giving them a platform they have not earned.\u201d\n\nWatch the ending of Cuomo\u2019s interview with McEnany below.\n\n\"No. I don't believe the President has lied.\"\n\nTrump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tells @ChrisCuomo President Trump has never lied to the country. pic.twitter.com/oSlLHZ4h0m \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) August 29, 2019", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67f61b2500003200743c88.png?cache=s1mhoefnzf&ops=1778_1000"}
