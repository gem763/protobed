{"title": "Listen to America", "pub_date": "None", "text": "What issues do people care about most in places we don\u2019t hear from often enough? That\u2019s what HuffPost set out to discover last year on our Listen to America bus tour. We interviewed nearly 1,700 people (you can hear more than 300 of them in this beautiful interactive) and listened. What we heard surprised us, and informs the stories we\u2019re telling at HuffPost today.\n\nHeading into the 2018 election cycle, we\u2019re going to go out and educate ourselves again. We\u2019re out on the road for a two-week journey through five Western states (four of which we didn\u2019t manage to visit last year) to talk about issues affecting communities in California, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona and Colorado. We\u2019re partnered with local media organizations to produce town hall events in each location where we address an issue of specific concern. For more detail, here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Sacramento, Reno, Boise, Boulder and Phoenix. All events will be livestreamed on this page, and HuffPost\u2019s social accounts.\n\nWant to make sure you hear from us on the road? Subscribe to HuffPost\u2019s Morning Email and you won\u2019t miss a thing. Want to share an issue that\u2019s important to you and your community? Email us at listening@huffpost.com. See you when we\u2019re back!", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e4f2391500004800da1a90.jpeg?ops=resize_1600_900"}
