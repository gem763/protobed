Gavin Newsom (D) gets his way, Donald Trump will have to release his taxes in order to appear on the state\u2019s primary presidential ballot next year. In late July, Newsom signed a bill requiring that any presidential or gubernatorial candidate must release five years of tax returns to qualify for the state\u2019s primary election ballots.\n\n\u201cThese are extraordinary times and states have a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards,\u201d Newsom wrote in his signing statement.\n\nBut aggressive legal suits are challenging the constitutionality of California\u2019s new law, arguing that states shouldn\u2019t be able to add new requirements about who can run for president willy-nilly.\n\nThe outcome doesn\u2019t matter for Trump or the 2020 election, but it could have profound implications for future presidential elections. If California\u2019s law withstands these legal challenges, what would stop a swing state held by one party in 2024, for example, from implementing a similar requirement designed to block a major party candidate from the ballot?\n\nTrump and the National Republican Committee quickly filed federal lawsuits against the measure, saying the law is unconstitutional and infringes on the president\u2019s free speech. The California Republican Party filed a lawsuit as well. The state Supreme Court has decided to hear both cases in a matter of weeks, which is a \u201cvery uncommon\u201d move, according to Leslie Gielow Jacobs, a constitutional law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California, and probably means the justices are wary of the new push.\n\nLawyers for the state of California and the California Republican Party will deliver their briefs to the state Supreme Court in just two weeks.\n\n\u2018Disclosure Is Part Of Our Political Tradition\u2019\n\nChristian Hartmann / Reuters Even if President Donald Trump doesn't qualify for California's primary ballot next year, Gov. Gavin Newsom's bill requiring candidates to disclose their tax returns could have profound implications for future presidential elections.\n\nIn the U.S. Constitution, there are three simple requirements that one must meet in order to serve as president: You must be over the age of 35, you must be a natural-born citizen and you must have at least 14 years of residency.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is clear on the qualifications for someone to serve as president and states cannot add additional requirements on their own,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, told The New York Times in July.\n\nBut as Jacobs pointed out, the \u201cthe framers wanted to give lots of power to the states. For any elections for federal office, the [U.S.] Constitution gives the states lots of power to control how the elections take place.\u201d\n\nShe broke the argument down as a matter of qualifications versus rules. There are three solid, constitutionally protected qualifications to be president, but each state can make rules about how those elections are run.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of disclosure agreements that people who are running for office have to make,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cIn fact, there are a lot that people who hold office have to make. Disclosure requirements, as a condition to holding office, are pretty routine.\u201d In California, for example, candidates have to disclose their donors, donations and campaign expenditures.\n\nOther legal cases from the 1980s and 1990s have established how judges might respond to this one, said Chris Elmendorf, an election law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\nIn 1983, the Supreme Court found that Ohio had placed an unconstitutional burden on independent candidates for holding them to an early filing deadline, and that a state can\u2019t go too far in interfering with the national political process.\n\nThen, the Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that setting congressional term limits was also unconstitutional for establishing new qualifications for federal office outside of what the Constitution had already established.\n\n\u201cA similar concern might arise here,\u201d Elmendorf said. \u201cCalifornia is trying to disable a locally unpopular candidate, and in some sense thereby interfering with a national political process.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he added that \u201cdisclosure is part of our political tradition,\u201d and that the law could be seen \u201cas an effort to hold presidents at the same standards that legislators themselves comply with.\u201d\n\nBut on the state level, the law might also be in violation of Proposition 4, a 1972 state constitutional amendment that requires the state legislature \u201cto provide for open presidential primary\u201d by listing all candidates \u201cthroughout the nation or California\u201d and \u201csuch candidates whose names are placed on ballot by petition.\u201d Proposition 4 was introduced as a response to previous election ballots that excluded candidates from across the U.S.\n\n\u2018Today We Require Tax Returns, But What Would Be Next?\u2019\n\nDespite an impending visit to the Bay Area for a fundraising event on Sept. 17, without a significant primary challenger, Trump won\u2019t need the California votes, and he wouldn\u2019t lose much by not appearing on the state\u2019s primary ballot in March.\n\nEven if it\u2019s just a symbolic law \u2014 and political theater for Newsom, who ran for governor promising to take the fight to the Trump administration \u2015 a law like this could still have dangerous ramifications.\n\nEven Newsom\u2019s predecessor said the same. Former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar measure in 2017, saying he feared that it was not only unconstitutional, but that \u2015 even more concerning \u2015 a law like this could set a \u201c\u2018slippery slope\u2019 precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we require tax returns, but what would be next?\u201d Brown said at the time. \u201cFive years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?\u201d\n\nA qualified candidate\u2019s ability to appear on the ballot is fundamental to our democratic system. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown\n\nBrown was hardly thinking in hypotheticals. In 2009, shortly after the election of former President Barack Obama, a Republican congressman from Florida tried to introduce a law requiring all presidential candidates to submit copies of their birth certificates to the Federal Elections Committee.\n\n\u201cA qualified candidate\u2019s ability to appear on the ballot is fundamental to our democratic system,\u201d Brown said in 2017. \u201cFor that reason, I hesitate to start down a road that well might lead to an ever escalating set of differing state requirements for presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s 2019. Political norms everywhere are weakening or disappearing, and for now, all bets are off.\n\n\u201cThe conventions of what\u2019s within and out of bounds are entirely up for grabs,\u201d Elmendorf said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a surprise that you\u2019re seeing this kind of tax disclosure law being enacted for the first time, because previously no president would violate that convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think of a sort of candidate or officeholder as intrinsically illegitimate, anything you can do is worth doing,\u201d he said.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6824893c00008b0547e0a2.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
