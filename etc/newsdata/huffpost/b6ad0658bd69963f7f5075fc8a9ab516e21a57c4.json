Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent a letter Thursday to Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan objecting to the agency\u2019s last-minute decision to block committee staff from visiting this week, and requesting DHS allow \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to these facilities again.\n\n\u201cI am writing to express my deep concern that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decided to block Committee staff from conducting visits to 11 detention facilities just days after previous staff inspections revealed potentially serious ongoing problems with the treatment of children and adults in DHS custody \u2015 including blocking visits to sites where the Inspector General warned about \u2018an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,\u2019\u201d Cummings wrote in the letter.\n\nThe letter also said that DHS told the committee that new restrictions would be placed on staffers\u2019 access to facilities run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under DHS.\n\nCummings said the decision to bar committee staff goes against McAleenan\u2019s congressional testimony last month in which he said he welcomes such visits to detention centers.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLast month, the Inspector General of DHS released a report warning of severe overcrowding at some migrant detention centers, citing dangerous and unsanitary conditions, like a lack of shower access and room to lie down.\n\nCummings\u2019 letter contained similar concerns, saying migrants told committee staff during earlier trips to Border Patrol facilities that toddlers were being fed age-inappropriate food, young children were being held in cold rooms without proper clothing, and even that a Border Patrol agent told a child to drink spilled soup off the floor.\n\nMigrants at the facilities also told committee staff that agents pressured them into signing documents in English without proper translation or phone access, according to the committee chairman.\n\nDuring visits to ICE facilities \u2015 many of which are run by for-profit contractors \u2015 migrants told committee staff that they were being given rotten food and inadequate medical care access, the letter stated.\n\nCummings cited an instance at the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, where an ICE officer threatened to immediately end the congressional tour and cancel future visits after a detained migrant shouted through a glass partition that he wanted to speak with committee staff because he was allegedly being abused and humiliated at the facility.\n\nThe letter came after Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the committee\u2019s ranking member, said that the panel\u2019s staff were being \u201crude\u201d to officers at the facilities. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also alleged that committee staff weren\u2019t cooperating with officers, Cummings\u2019 letter stated.\n\nBut Cummings said the claims were false, and that committee staff cooperated with DHS \u201cwhile defending the authority of Congress to conduct an independent investigation of these well-documented abuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Administration expects Congress to be satisfied with receiving agency tours of facilities \u2015 in some cases without the ability to photograph conditions or interview detainees \u2015 and not to question the policies or decisions that agency officials make,\u201d Cummings wrote in his letter.\n\n\u201cThat is not the way effective oversight works,\u201d he continued. \u201cCongress has an independent responsibility under the Constitution to determine whether federal programs are operating as they should be \u2015 not merely to accept the Administration\u2019s word for it.\u201d\n\nRead Rep. Cummings\u2019 letter to DHS below:", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6859072500004e0089530d.jpeg?cache=ftmi9cxikj&ops=1778_1000"}
