Terrible considering that Fox couldn\u2019t even land a debate, the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN & @MSNBC.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\n....are all in for the Open Border Socialists (or beyond). Fox hires \u201cgive Hillary the questions\u201d @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That\u2019s what I do, Win. Too Bad!.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\n....I don\u2019t want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom,\u201d host Brooke Baldwin asked Cameron if he believed Trump\u2019s tweets were the president \u201csort of indirectly acknowledging that he thought Fox was an arm of the Republican Party or even an arm of his own administration?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that makes the news department at Fox News, where I worked for a number of years, sick to their stomachs,\u201d Cameron replied.\n\n\u201cNews people don\u2019t like to hear that stuff,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe entertainment side, on the other hand, is vastly different and it\u2019s a threat to them. And Trump is basically challenging the Sean Hannitys of Fox News to beat up on the journalists. That\u2019s not going to work either.\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment here:", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d67abfa2500005104741143.png?cache=tt6smdx6re&ops=1778_1000"}
