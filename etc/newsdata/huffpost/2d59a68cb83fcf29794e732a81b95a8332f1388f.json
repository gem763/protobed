I\u2019m just me. I\u2019m just sexy,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you saw Anne Hathaway in a bikini on a billboard, you wouldn\u2019t call her brave.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s fame took off this summer with hits like \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d and \u201cGood As Hell.\u201d She\u2019s known for preaching body positivity in her songs and interviews \u2014 and her most recent album \u201cCuz I Love You\u201d does just that.\n\nWhile people have applauded the singer for her self-love and body positive anthems, Lizzo told Glamour she doesn\u2019t appreciate when people are surprised by her confidence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it when people think it\u2019s hard for me to see myself as beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people are shocked that I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Lizzo made it clear she loves herself exactly how she is in a conversation with V Magazine. She told the magazine she loves being \u201ca fat bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my body,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what angle you shoot it at ... my body is just so fucking beautiful all the time. I may talk shit about it sometimes, but fuck. She\u2019s still a bad bitch.\u201d\n\nHead over to Glamour to read Lizzo\u2019s full interview.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d66a4712500003400884c40.jpeg?cache=pyd8foiok3&ops=1778_1000"}
