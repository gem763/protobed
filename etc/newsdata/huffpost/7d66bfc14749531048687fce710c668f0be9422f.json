China has not confirmed that such calls took place. A spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said after Trump\u2019s announcement Monday that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any such calls.\n\nCNN reported Thursday that Trump \u201cconflated\u201d some kind of communication with the Chinese with a statement at a business forum in China by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Two unnamed officials told CNN that Trump \u201cwas eager to project optimism that might boost the markets.\u201d World financial markets, which swooned the previous week as Trump intensified his China trade war rhetoric, rebounded after the president\u2019s phone calls announcement.\n\nConway said such \u201cmarket manipulation\u201d constitutes \u201ccriminal violations\u201d of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nWhat this describes is, quite literally, market manipulation that constitutes criminal violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: https://t.co/xiit4yl7xv pic.twitter.com/aVMl9f88Zp \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) August 29, 2019\n\nMarket manipulation occurs when \u201csomeone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically),\u201d according to a fact sheet from the Securities and Exchange Commission. It can involve a \u201cnumber of techniques to affect the supply of, or demand for, a stock,\u201d including \u201cspreading false or misleading information.\u201d\n\nIf Trump\u2019s account of the China calls was not accurate, his announcement artificially boosted markets and people profited from it. It\u2019s not clear if political information \u2014 or falsehoods \u2014 could be considered market manipulation.\n\nTrump has also picked out companies \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 to attack in tweets, affecting stock values.\n\nSome observers, including NBC analyst (and former HuffPost global editorial director) Howard Fineman, have wondered whether the president\u2019s associates and relatives are profiting from advance knowledge of Trump\u2019s market-moving tweets.\n\nMy twitter feed is asking a legitimate question: are @realDonaldTrump\u2019s businesses and family profiting from insider knowledge of his pending \u2014 market-moving \u2014 tweets, comments and bargaining stands? My guess would be yes. The real questions are: who is doing it for him and how? \u2014 Howard Fineman (@howardfineman) June 9, 2019\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier this year about Trump\u2019s debt-laden businesses \u2014 and how he tried to make money in the market. According to the Times, Trump appeared to repeatedly profit in the stock market in the 1980s by presenting himself as a takeover threat by investing in certain companies. After reports of his involvement boosted stock values, he would then unload his investments before others realized there wasn\u2019t going to be deal and pocket the profit.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68a4413c00004e00482e11.jpeg?cache=sk2dcmttgb&ops=1778_1000"}
