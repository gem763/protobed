You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe post prompted #BoycottMulan to begin trending on Twitter with some claiming that Liu\u2019s comments are at odds with what the character Mulan actually stands for.\n\nMulan is about a female taking control and fighting for her own destiny. Liu Yifei supporting an entity that assaults women who dare to voice their opinion shows her indifference. @Disney is willing to ignore this for the big bucks in China, but we shouldn't. #BoycottMulan pic.twitter.com/giDHC0nBuy \u2014 Melody (@_melotweets) August 16, 2019\n\nFriendly reminder:\n\nHeartless HK police are aiming people head and using expired tear gas INSIDE railway station.\n\nEven First-AID team has been attacked by those motherfkers\n\n\n\nIf U are still going to MULAN.\n\nI AM FUCKING DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR HUMANITY. @disney#BoycottMulan pic.twitter.com/sjG4NoBOvd \u2014 sophia rei rika (@rikaxlikars) August 16, 2019\n\nYou portrayed a hero that saves people, but it's okay to u to that other people control them. shame on u sis#BoycottMulan \u2014 s\u2661ne (@SNSDislayff) August 16, 2019\n\nDemonstrations in Hong Kong began in June after the proposal of a controversial bill that would allow for the extradition of people to mainland China. While Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam suspended the bill after the protests began two months ago, she didn\u2019t scrap it entirely and refused to resign.\n\nSince then, protests have ramped up, with demonstrators shutting down Hong Kong airport this week. Police have been using tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators gathered on city streets.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b71b3752000009f00379974.png?cache=sz9w1s3npm&ops=1778_1000"}
