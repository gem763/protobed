Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) isn\u2019t bothered by a recent attack video produced by the right-wing group Media Research Center (MRC) \u2015 in fact, she thinks they\u2019re doing her a favor.\n\nI love everything about this GOP attack ad.\n\n\n\nRepublicans underestimate my intelligence bc I invite people into my home & talk about policy in plain English instead of DC jargon.\n\n\n\nThey think that\u2019s dumb, so they end up paying for ads that spread & explain our policy positions. \ud83e\udd23 https://t.co/6XC1YdyKDU \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nThe MRC TV video is framed as a spoof of Jack Handey\u2019s \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d skit from \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Dubbed \u201cShallow Thoughts,\u201d it features footage of Ocasio-Cortez discussing climate change that had originally appeared on her Instagram. In the story, Ocasio-Cortez said that fighting climate change may be expensive, but ignoring it could have much more costly effects.\n\n\u201cYou think overhauling our economy to decarbonize and save the planet is going to be expensive? Try not decarbonizing our economy and allowing sea levels to rise, every coastal city to go underwater,\u201d she said.\n\nMRC responded to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s response with a blog post that mocked her intelligence for mistaking the conservative organization as an official Republican group. They said the video was not an ad and was not paid for by the GOP.\n\nNumerous Twitter users responded to MRC\u2019s comments with a few observations of their own:\n\nGood ad for AOC. \u2014 'Stache (@Stache2020) August 29, 2019\n\nNice work @mrctv! You helped @AOC let the alt right know how much trouble we're in!\n\n\n\nNow do one for @ewarren @BernieSanders and @SenKamalaHarris You could have Bernie explaining Dem Socialism, Warren explaining wall street and Harris explaining @realDonaldTrump ! #WinningBigly pic.twitter.com/DpVWAoeLNz \u2014 markusgarvey\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@markusgarvey) August 29, 2019\n\nUm everything @AOC said there was 100% correct and well articulated. \u2014 Andrew Wortman (@AmoneyResists) August 29, 2019\n\nTranslation: The GOP is scared of AOC. \u2014 Trumpy Trumpy (parody) (@outofcontroljb) August 29, 2019\n\nYou played ..... yourself. Lol \u2014 Rhonda Harbison (@rhonda_harbison) August 29, 2019\n\nShe's right. Good job @AOC \u2014 BC, one of the Squad \ud83c\udf39 (@BCnumber11) August 29, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s such a relief to see both sides of the US political spectrum working together to explain the cost of ignoring climate change. https://t.co/zNaDBuUKAM \u2014 Kat (@KatArt2) August 29, 2019\n\nThanks for spreading her message. \u2014 Troy (@tr0yster) August 29, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s straightforward and lays out the facts clearly.\n\nI don\u2019t see the problem\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Danielle Couffon (@icequeen1371) August 29, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s right. Did you mean this to be an negative ad? pic.twitter.com/oahZZPDRRm \u2014 Tyler Hamilton (@tylhamilton) August 29, 2019\n\nThanks for the info but I don't think you intended it to help @AOC did you? Putting \"death\" in quotes doesn't make it any less real, or support any claim you're implying that it won't happen. We all die and climate change is likely to accelerate it for a whole bunch of creatures. \u2014 Calamum In Gladio (@CalamumInGladio) August 29, 2019\n\nThanks for spreading her accurate message! Terrific self-own! \u2014 Snax Gorge 'em (@daxjordan) August 29, 2019\n\nFree ad for AOC. Really nice music, tho. \u2014 Jim Mayfield (@JimmyMayfield) August 29, 2019\n\nSo y'all spent money spreading her message even further? pic.twitter.com/3Hje3EUO8L \u2014 We Are Legion (@Anonymous_78) August 30, 2019\n\nDo you disagree with the Pentagon's threat assessment? Because that is what they are saying as well. \u2014 OlympicDane (@mortenbc58) August 29, 2019\n\nSo she explained the conclusions of the DoD, NASA, IPCC, and NOAA reports in plain English but it was too complex for you? \u2014 Rich Patina (@candiedhams) August 29, 2019", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68b43d250000320074ad93.jpeg?cache=5dkrfvcxyq&ops=1778_1000"}
