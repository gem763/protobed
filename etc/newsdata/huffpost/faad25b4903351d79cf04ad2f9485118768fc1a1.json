The clip features Sanders slamming his bare fist into a punching bag, which rebounds and bonks him on the head.\n\nSanders took the blow with good humor.\n\nBut Trump Jr. used the clip to suggest world leaders might do the same if Sanders were to win the 2020 election instead of his dear old dad, Donald Trump.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t exactly strike fear in the minds of our adversaries. Imagine this guy sitting accross the table negotiating with world leaders? pic.twitter.com/FdErYWwAyo \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) August 28, 2019\n\nBoth politics and boxing can be pretty brutal, but Trump Jr. apparently posted the video before realizing he was setting himself up \u2015 once again \u2015 as a punching bag for Twitter users.\n\nAnd they were happy to pile on:\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the one-two combo of, \"god forbid an old man have a sense of humor about himself\" and \"obviously donald trump is in peek physical condition\". \u2014 CSPAM2 (@cspamus1) August 29, 2019\n\nImagine this guy: pic.twitter.com/h5OD7OsLUv \u2014 King of Juice (@KingofJuice3) August 28, 2019\n\nHilarious that he thinks his obese joke of a dad who needed a golf cart while every other world leader walked strikes fear or respect, we have seen the photos where he is sitting alone while everyone else is talking, making deals while he sits arms crossed and pouts pic.twitter.com/xpBpH7jKPn \u2014 Diana Garcia (@guinea_wrangler) August 28, 2019\n\nTry again, Junior!
