The findings directly point to runaway climate change spurred by greenhouse gas emissions as the prime threat to the structure, noting that the time to protect the reef\u2019s \u201clong-term future is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change is escalating and is the most significant threat to the region\u2019s long-term outlook,\u201d the authority said. \u201cSignificant global action to address climate change is critical to slowing deterioration of the reef\u2019s ecosystem and heritage values and supporting recovery. ... The significant and large-scale impacts from record-breaking sea surface temperatures have resulted in coral reef habitat transitioning from poor to very poor condition.\u201d\n\nThe paper is the third released by the country, and the authority has been tracking the reef\u2019s troubles since 2009. Aside from climate change, the report points to other issues facing the reef, including outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and poor water quality linked to farming runoff.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report has downgraded the health of the reef to 'very poor'.

Scientists who visited the reef after those events likened them as an underwater apocalypse that left large stretches of the structure, the largest living thing on the planet, cooked to death.\n\nResearchers issued some silver linings at the time, however, urging the world to take action to save the reef before it\u2019s too late.\n\nFriday\u2019s findings prompted immediate concern from environmental groups who have long warned that federal action to address the decline of the reef hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\n\u201cThis is now the third Outlook Report. We\u2019ve had 10 years of warnings, 10 years of rising greenhouse emissions and 10 years watching the Reef heading for a catastrophe,\u201d Imogen Zethoven, director of strategy for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, a nonprofit conservation group, said in a statement. \u201cWe are seeing the results of government inaction on climate change. This latest report outlines the big threats from warming oceans and poor water quality. Nobody can say they were not warned.\u201d\n\nCredit: Greg Torda/ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies The Great Barrier Reef was hit by devastating, back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 that left wide swaths of corals dead.\n\n\"Australia can continue to fail on climate policy and remain a major coal exporter or Australia can turn around the Reef\u2019s decline. But it can\u2019t do both. That\u2019s clear from the government\u2019s own scientific reports.\" - Richard Leck, WWF Head of Oceanshttps://t.co/WQqIniTAMa \u2014 WWF_Australia (@WWF_Australia) August 30, 2019\n\nSussan Ley, the country\u2019s environment minister, responded to the report on Friday by touting the government\u2019s initiatives to protect the reef. Australia has released a Reef 2050 Plan that focuses on efforts to save the Great Barrier over the next 30 years, but the proposal has been criticized for not going far enough to address climate change as the root cause of the reef\u2019s woes.\n\n\u201cWe have the best-managed reef ecosystem in the world,\u201d Ley said in an editorial in The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cWe have a massive job to do in protecting its future and we are getting on with that job. ... I trust the scientists who tell me that climate change is the biggest single threat to the reef, just as I trust those who tell me of the things we can do, and are doing, to make the reef more resilient.\u201d\n\nDespite Ley\u2019s assurances that the reef was \u201cteeming with life\u201d when she visited in recent weeks, the report Friday painted a bleak picture for the future of the reef should the government fail to enact its own policies, noting that without dramatic action, a part of Australia\u2019s core identity could soon disappear.\n\n\u201cWithout additional local, national and global action on the greatest threats, the overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecosystem will remain very poor, with continuing consequences for its heritage values,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe window of opportunity to improve the Reef\u2019s long-term future is now.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58eb63e416000021004d9a3b.jpeg?cache=og6k4h7ipa&ops=1778_1000"}
