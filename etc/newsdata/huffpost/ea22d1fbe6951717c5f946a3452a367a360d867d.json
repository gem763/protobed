Roughly half of the new tariffs are due to take effect on Sept. 1 and the other half are set for Dec. 15. The Chinese tariffs already in place are expected to cost the average household $600 per year.\n\nIn total, the impact of tariffs are predicted to effectively wipe out tax breaks from President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul, which JPMorgan estimates to be $1,300 per year.\n\nThe latest rounds of tariffs will affect consumption and capital goods, the analysis noted, differing from previous tariffs that have targeted intermediate goods, which are unfinished products sold to manufacturers. That means American shoppers may see the looming tariffs hit their wallets even more.\n\nWhile Trump has previously and falsely claimed that the tariffs will be paid by China while strengthening the U.S. and lowering its trade deficit, it appears the Trump administration expects consumers will feel the effects.\n\nInitially, the 10% tariffs were supposed to be implemented all at once in September. However, the partial delay has been advertised as a way to help families who will soon be preparing for the holidays.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, shortly after the delay was announced, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro called it a \u201cChristmas present to the nation.\u201d\n\nIn May, economists from the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Harvard University and the University of Chicago published a study finding that the burden is being placed \u201clargely on the U.S.\u201d A separate IMF report on the study explained that while both American and Chinese consumers \u201care unequivocally the losers from trade tensions ... tariff revenue collected has been borne almost entirely by U.S. importers.\u201d", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5ae2592400003800b03647.jpeg?cache=gbzlq5mqfh&ops=1778_1000"}
