Take a page out of Priyanka Chopra\u2019s \u201cGuide to PDA When You\u2019re Not Even In The Same Building\u201d and just photoshop yourself into key moments to remind everyone that, yes, you are still married.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers made their return to the MTV Video Music Awards on Monday night \u2015 their first appearance at the award show since reforming as a boyband after a decade-long hiatus \u2015 and celebrated the big night with Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas\u2019 wife, and Danielle Jonas, who is married to Kevin Jonas.\n\nHowever, Chopra, who wed Nick Jonas in a series of lavish (and branded) celebrations in December 2018, did not attend the show \u2014 and her absence became all the more conspicuous right after the group won the Best Pop Video award for their hit song \u201cSucker:\u201d Her sisters-in-law kissed their respective JoBros, while fifth-wheeling Nick Jonas\u2019 facial expression quickly became a viral meme.\n\nSo to make up for skipping the event, Chopra decided to photoshop a freeze frame of the moment, showing herself passionately hugging her husband.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always with you @nickjonas,\u201d she captioned the group photo. \u201cCongratulations @jonasbrothers! I\u2019m so proud of all of you! #sucker.\u201d\n\nThe Bollywood star has a personal stake in the award, as the music video for the single was a family affair: Chopra, Turner and Danielle Jonas galavanted around around a massive estate with their husbands, wearing outrageous outfits.\n\n\u201cThey were excited,\u201d Nick Jonas said on Sirius XM about bringing their wives on board for the video, adding that the three refer to themselves as the J Sisters. \u201cThat\u2019s the cool part about this next chapter. We\u2019ve been saying this, but family is our favorite F-word.\u201d\n\nAnd after the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 charts, Jonas gifted Chopra a Maybach like it was no big deal.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear why Chopra chose to opt out of the awards show \u2014 though she recently received criticism for a controversial statement at Beautycon \u2014 as she\u2019s been a big supporter of the band, traveling to Miami for the opening night of their tour earlier this month.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d66aa3b3c0000510046f79d.png?cache=ks6jepj4ka&ops=1778_1000"}
