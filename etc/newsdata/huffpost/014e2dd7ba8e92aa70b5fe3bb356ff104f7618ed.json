(AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday defended his faulty description of a tale of military heroism and his interactions with the service members who carried it out.\n\nThe \u201cessence\u201d of his recollection is correct, the former vice president told a South Carolina newspaper Thursday after a Washington Post story detailed how an emotional anecdote Biden told recently while campaigning in New Hampshire contained inaccuracies.\n\nBiden\u2019s telling appeared to conflate multiple events, yielding a single story of Vice President Biden pinning a Silver Star on a U.S. Navy captain in the Konar province of Afghanistan for his efforts trying to save another service member. In his latest telling of a story he\u2019s varied over several years, according to the Post, Biden got most of the details wrong: There\u2019s no military record of that specific ceremony, and Biden\u2019s records as a senator show he traveled to Konar when he was Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman and before he was vice president.\n\nBiden and his aides countered that the anecdote\u2019s fundamental point \u2014 that as vice president he once formally recognized the valor of a heartbroken solider who didn\u2019t want the recognition because his fellow solider ultimately lost his life \u2014 is true.\n\n\u201cThe central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said,\u201d Biden told The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, South Carolina, hours after the Post published its story. \u201cHe refused the medal. I put it on him, he said: \u2018Don\u2019t do that to me, sir. He died. He died.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, The Post account quoted Staff Sgt. Chad Workman recalling that he received a Bronze Star from Biden at Forward Operating Base Airborne in Wardak province, Afghanistan, on Jan. 11, 2011. Workman confirmed Biden\u2019s account, adding that Biden treated him with empathy.\n\nIn an interview with Washington Post\u2019s Jonathan Capehart, Biden suggested the account he was referring to was Workman\u2019s story. \u201cI was making the point how courageous these people are, how incredible they are, this generation of warriors, these fallen angels we\u2019ve lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is. What is it that I said wrong?\u201d\n\nThe accounts represent a growing conundrum for Democrats. Their 2020 front-runner is hinging his campaign on the propositions that President Donald Trump is a serial liar and a fundamental threat to the nation and that Biden, a 76-year-old veteran of U.S. politics and world affairs, offers his party the best hope of victory.\n\nBut Biden is also repeatedly subjected to media scrutiny, social media derision and quiet grumbling from his rivals over his penchant for verbal missteps, a cacophony that fosters questions about whether he is indeed the best Democrat to send into a general election campaign against Trump.\n\nBiden rejected those questions, telling the Post and Courier they are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nVeteran Democratic strategist David Axelrod said the episode speaks to two well-known attributes of Biden: his liability as undisciplined and his strength as one who empathizes with those in pain.\n\nAxelrod doesn\u2019t see it as particularly damaging, but notes such episodes, should they continue, could answer one of the central question facing Biden: Is he up to the intellectual rigors of being president?\n\n\u201cWhere it becomes problematical is if It\u2019s seen as evidence of some sort of decay,\u201d said Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cThat is obviously a danger. Anything that raises those concerns is problematic. I don\u2019t think this is the one that could tip the scales.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s supporters this week in South Carolina have been unfazed by any mounting criticism \u2014 particularly in comparison to Trump, who regularly misspeaks and has treated truth casually since he first launched his campaign in 2015.\n\n\u201cLook at Trump, a habitual, sinister liar,\u201d said Dawn Deboskey, a 57-year-old from Anderson, South Carolina. \u201cThe vice president is absolutely on point, discussing every issue in a knowledgeable way. I have zero concerns.\u201d\n\nAt the campaign town hall where Deboskey came to see Biden, the candidate opted for a humorous defense against those who question whether he\u2019s still up for the job. On education, he opted against offering detailed numbers when talking through his usual riff on the need for more social workers.\n\nOffer a number and turn out to be wrong, Biden said, \u201cand the press will say Biden\u2019s losing his mind. He can\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\n__\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68f2c63c00008b05486541.jpeg?cache=5c6rf1cmgq&ops=1778_1000"}
