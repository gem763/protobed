VDare\u2019s anti-Semitic slurs were linked to in a daily Department of Justice news briefing sent earlier this month to immigration judges. VDare has since been booted from YouTube.\n\nThe Justice Department blamed a contractor for sending the VDare link in the newsletter and said it should not have been included. \u201cThe Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism and white nationalism in the strongest terms,\u201d said Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for the department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review, which is responsible for arranging the briefings.\n\nThe lion logo has also been posted by a Dutch white supremacist whose Twitter account was suspended, Mediaite reported.\n\nNow Trump has tweeted the video with the logo over the words: \u201cTrump Pence Keep America Great.\u201d Trump noted at the top of the video: \u201cThank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nThank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! pic.twitter.com/qKgwRMSgcf \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\nThe Trump campaign told Mediaite that the president \u201cshared an independently-produced video that highlighted the strengths of the economy his policies have created. Any conspiracy connected to white supremacy exists only in the fevered minds of reporters who will believe anything negative about the president.\u201d\n\nThe logo clones were apparently noted first by former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski, according to Mediaite.\n\nMedium traced the inspiration for the lion logo to a quote from Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini that Trump retweeted in February 2016: \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\u201d Trump later said on NBC: \u201cIt\u2019s a very good quote. I didn\u2019t know who said it, but what difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else? It\u2019s a very good quote.\u201d\n\n\"@ilduce2016: \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\u201d \u2013 @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016\n\nThe lion logo appeared the following month on a website and Twitter account launched by a group calling itself the Lion Guard, which vowed to protect Trump supporters and \u201cforcefully protect\u201d Trump from threats. The logo soon appeared on VDare\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nTrump takes every original colony except NJ, which hasn't voted yet.

The user indicated he simply randomly chose the lion logo from images he found in a Google search.\n\nFor those asking me about lions.\n\n\n\nI googled \"trump logo png.\" It returned several images, which I recreated.\n\n\n\nGOOGLE. TAGGED. THAT. LION. AS. MAGA.\n\n\n\nIf it's something else, it occurs to me the REAL question is: Why is GOOGLE associating white supremacist metadata with Trump/MAGA? pic.twitter.com/zfhxabZq6F \u2014 SOMETHiNG WiCK\u00cbD (@som3thingwicked) August 29, 2019\n\nVDare tweeted Thursday: \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake. No we didn\u2019t invent the \u2018Trump Lion\u2019 logo. Some anon did.\u201d VDare founder, right-wing English immigrant Peter Brimelow, called leftists \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nWhat this ridiculous lion logo smear of @realDonaldTrump (and @vdare) tells you is that Leftist are (a) stupid (b) hysterical (c) have limitless money and time. What \"top down\" group is directing this? https://t.co/D24EOGUnnS \u2014 Peter Brimelow (@peterbrimelow) August 30, 2019\n\nThe VDare blog is named after Virginia Dare, the first white English Colonist born in North America in 1587. The blog \u201cregularly publishes articles by prominent white nationalists ... and anti-Semites,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Washington Post reported last week that Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow had invited Brimelow to a recent birthday party at his home.", "img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d685d06250000710a747885.jpeg?cache=n3mwrmnins&ops=1778_1000"}
