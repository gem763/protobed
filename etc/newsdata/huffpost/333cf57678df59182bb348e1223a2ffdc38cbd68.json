I just kind of blew into the room, ordered a glass of white wine and started complaining,\u201d she recalled of their first meeting, according to Variety.\n\nJohansson remembered that \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d director was attentive as she vented about splitting up with French businessman Romain Dauriac in 2017 when Baumbach finally mustered up the courage to say:\n\n\u201c\u2018Funny you should mention it.\u2019\u201d Johansson recalled him saying.\n\nBaumbach then warned her: \u201cThis is probably a project \u2026 that you are either going to really want to do or not want to see or be a part of.\u201d\n\nBut it seems that Johansson was game.\n\n\u201cIt felt sort of fated in a way,\u201d she said of the role. \u201cIt was a really cathartic experience to be able to share with him and then to have him also share with me and it just came at somehow the right time.\u201d\n\nJohansson stars alongside Adam Driver, 35, in the film as a couple \u2014 she\u2019s an actor and he\u2019s a theater director \u2014 with a child managing a bi-coastal separation and divorce. Baumbach has said the film draws on his experiences when he and actor Jennifer Jason Leigh broke up in 2013. Johansson had previously divorced actor Ryan Reynolds in 2011.\n\nThough Johansson and Baumbach have both experienced their fair share of heartbreak, both seem to be in happy relationships now. Baumbach and fellow director Greta Gerwig welcomed their first child together in March, while Johansson announced her engagement to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Colin Jost in May.\n\n\u201cMarriage Story\u201d hits theaters on Nov. 6, followed by its Netflix debut on Dec. 6.
