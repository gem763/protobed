{"title": "Phoebe Robinson On How To Be A Boss Queen", "pub_date": "2019-08-29 09:41:53-04:00", "text": "Phoebe Robinson knows very well what not to do as a boss. Before she was a successful stand-up comedian, actor and podcast host, Robinson had her fair share of awful managers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in offices where it\u2019s like, you can\u2019t look the exec in the eye when they\u2019re walking down the hallway,\u201d Robinson said during our interview for HuffPost\u2019s series \u201cBetween You & Me\u201d in New York\u2019s East Village. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m the same person as you. Like, I fart, I burp, I oversleep. There is none of that sort of, like, \u2018I\u2019m better than you\u2019 vibe. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nFor the comedian and New York Times bestselling author, who rocketed to fame with her podcast-turned-HBO series \u201c2 Dope Queens,\u201d musing on what exactly makes a good boss isn\u2019t something she\u2019s dwelling on abstractly.\n\nAfter a decade of hustling in the comedy world, Robinson recently locked down a multi-year overall deal with ABC Studios with her own production house, Tiny Reparations, where she will be developing new projects and shows. Last month, she announced a forthcoming interview show with Comedy Central, produced by Robinson and the production house behind Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s popular series, \u201cComedians In Cars Getting Coffee.\u201d\n\nChristy Havranek/HuffPost\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily know how much she\u2019s grinding based on the fun she exudes in her irreverent Instagram posts, ranging from Robinson hanging out with her girl \u201cMeesh\u201d (aka Michelle Obama, for whom Robinson hosted five fireside-style chats during the former first lady\u2019s book tour) to Robinson debating whether Bono is, indeed, the sexiest member of U2.\n\nBut Robinson has been hard at work, and taking the time to build her brand and business \u2014 all while being an employee-affirming boss \u2014 is something she takes seriously.\n\n\u201cI had to look up insurance packages for my employees. I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t fucking know.\u2019 You know what I mean? It\u2019s just like these things you don\u2019t think about that are more logistical, and you want to make sure you\u2019re taking care of people,\u201d she said.\n\nTreating her business like a family has become second nature for Robinson. She has made partnership the core of her ascendency, counting powerhouse female comedians like Ilana Glazer and Jessica Williams as some of her closest friends and creative partners.\n\nIt\u2019s in part these relationships that have emboldened Robinson to advocate more for herself in the workplace. Many of the roles she auditioned for at the beginning of her career played into tropes about Black women, such as \u201cthe white girl\u2019s best friend\u201d or \u201cthe sassy Black assistant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just like, I\u2019m not doing that crap. That\u2019s not my experience. It\u2019s not the experience of any of the Black women that I have in my life,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nChristy Havranek/HuffPost\n\nRobinson\u2019s core team is made up of nearly all women, as anyone who follows her on the \u2019gram will know. Her chief of staff, Mai Huynh, frequently makes hilarious appearances, essentially becoming a star in her own right \u2014 usually at Robinson\u2019s comedic expense. And then, of course, there is Robinson\u2019s boyfriend, aka British Bake-Off, named fondly in reference to the popular PBS competition show.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s originally from Bournemouth, and there are no people of color there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I had, like, giant, giant braids when I went. So there was a lot of people like, \u2018Oh, my God, your hair. It\u2019s so cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nClearly, the eager Brits hadn\u2019t read Robinson\u2019s book on the subject.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a rude thing, so I didn\u2019t mind as much. But still, I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t touch my hair,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was like really cute old ladies being like, \u2018You look beautiful.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018All right, I\u2019ll take it.\u2019\u201d\n\nCatch Robinson on her first solo stand-up tour, \u201cSorry, Harriet Tubman\u2033 now.
