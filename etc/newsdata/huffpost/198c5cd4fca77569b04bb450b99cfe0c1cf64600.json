The elements of truth and genuine joy for the process are timeless. That will always be our classroom focus.\u201d\n\nA student who took his co-taught class in 2016 gave him five stars on Rate My Professors and said the class was \u201cALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!\u201d (The actor\u2019s signature line comes from the 1993 film \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d set in Austin.)\n\nThough students at Moody College are surely thrilled to have the expertise of the Oscar and Golden Globe-winning actor this semester, many Twitter users who aren\u2019t students (yet) expressed their sudden and immense desire to go to college.\n\nSee some of the best tweets about his appointment below:\n\nMe applying at UT Austin after I hear Matthew McConaughey is going to be a professor: pic.twitter.com/XeSdov7dtb \u2014 Bridget Bundy (@BridgetBundy) August 28, 2019\n\nMatthew McConaughey is gonna be a professor at UT Austin so I guess I\u2019m transferring pic.twitter.com/q83YbAeeeb \u2014 shea butter baby \u2728\ud83c\udf19 (@50ShadesofKeke) August 28, 2019\n\nMatthew McConaughey is gonna be a teacher in Texas.\n\n\n\nYEHAW BITCHES SEE YA IN COLLEGE pic.twitter.com/f7Fz9koLQI \u2014 Queen B (@TheBigestFandom) August 28, 2019\n\nMe checking Twitter to make sure that Matthew McConaughey is alright. pic.twitter.com/9Bdov6oCMN \u2014 Cameron Grant (@IAmCoolerCam101) August 28, 2019\n\nimagine walking into class and seeing matthew mcconaughey i\u2019d just pic.twitter.com/XCH1aRZZZH \u2014 kass !
