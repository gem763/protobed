       "\"Mediation between the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team and U.S. Soccer broke down this week, putting into question the future of the team’s fight over equal pay.\\n\\nPlayers with the USWNT sued U.S. Soccer in March, accusing the federation of not compensating or treating them in a manner equivalent to what the men’s team received. Mediation began in New York this week as representatives from both sides met to discuss compensation and treatment—but the efforts came to a seemingly abrupt stop on Wednesday. USWNT spokesperson Molly Levinson said they ended the meetings “sorely disappointed in the federation’s determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior.”\\n\\nShe added that the ongoing dispute over pay disparity is likely to end up in a trial.\\n\\n“It is clear that USSF, including its Board of Directors and President Carlos Cordeiro, fully intend to continue to compensate women players less than men. They will not succeed,” Levinson said. “We want all of our fans, sponsors, peers around the world, and women everywhere to know we are undaunted and will eagerly look forward to a jury trial.”\\n\\nRepresentatives for U.S. Soccer did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment. In a statement to CNN, the organization said, “We have said numerous times that our goal is to find a resolution, and during mediation we had hoped we would be able to address the issues in a respectful manner and reach an agreement.”\\n\\nHere’s what to know about the USWNT’s ongoing fight for equal pay.\\n\\nWhat the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team players want\\n\\nIn a class action lawsuit filed in March and signed by 28 players on the USWNT, the women allege that they are consistently paid less than the players on the men’s team and discriminated against because of their gender, despite a strong performance record.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was part of a years-long battle between the USWNT and U.S. Soccer regarding equal pay and gender equality. In 2016, five of the team’s players filed a complaint over unequal pay and bonuses with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In 2017, the players signed a new collective-bargaining agreement with the soccer federation and won control over some licensing and marketing rights. But the USWNT says that agreement did not go far enough.\\n\\n“Despite continued discrimination, we do feel like we have made progress toward a more collaborative way of operating. And yet, while we made progress in our compensation terms, we were still unable to achieve equal treatment with the Men’s National Team in the CBA we ratified in April 2017,” they wrote in a letter to the federation Monday ahead of the mediation.\\n\\nNow, following years of frustration between the players and the federation, the USWNT is pointing to their successes and widespread popularity as one factor in the push for equal pay. They’ve won four of eight World Cup titles since the championship games began in 1991 and four Olympic gold medals since the first women’s soccer tournament in 1996.\\n\\nIn their letter to U.S. Soccer, the women’s team pointed to their “remarkable” success during the 2019 World Cup. “We witnessed higher revenue numbers, higher ratings, more fans, more enthusiasm,” the players wrote. “The tired, arcane, irrelevant arguments and protestations of the male-dominated soccer world fell apart during those weeks.”\\n\\nThey added: “For both parties, the risk of not resolving our disagreements over equal treatment that were not addressed either in bargaining or through the EEOC is too high.”\\n\\nMegan Rapinoe of the USA lifts the FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy following her team's victory in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup France Final match between The United States of America and The Netherlands at Stade de Lyon on July 07, 2019 in Lyon, France. Alex Grimm—Getty Images\\n\\nWhat U.S. Soccer has said\\n\\nIn an open letter issued after the lawsuit was filed, the U.S. Soccer said it surprised by the complaint and that it had increased its investment in the women’s team in recent years.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer denied the women players’ claims in a court filing in May, saying the gap in pay stems from “differences in aggregate revenue generated by the different teams and/or any other factor other than sex,” arguing that the men’s and women’s teams are “physically and functionally separate organizations,” the Washington Post reported in July.\\n\\nAfter the World Cup, U.S. Soccer hired two lobbying firms in Washington D.C. to deny the claims of unequal pay in front of Congress, which sought to require the federation to pay both teams equally, according to a Politico report. While the U.S. government does not fund U.S. Soccer, the USWNT’s fight over equal pay has attracted attention from lawmakers. More than 50 members of Congress sent a letter to U.S. Soccer decrying the unequal treatment alleged by the USWNT. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin tied the equal pay issue into a bill he introduced that would withhold federal funding for the men’s 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, until the pay dispute was resolved.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer’s move to hire lobbyists was criticized by both the mens and women’s teams.\\n\\nAt the end of July, U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro argued that the women’s team has actually been paid more than the men’s team, saying that the federation paid the USWNT $34.1 million in salaries and game bonuses, while the men received $26.4 million. The figures, compiled by U.S. Soccer and based on an analysis by the federation’s staff, did not include the benefits, such as health care and a 401(k), that female players get. (Men are not provided the same benefits, according to the federation). U.S. Soccer’s numbers also included National Women’s Soccer League salaries that U.S. Soccer pays, which were negotiated in the 2017 CBA. (The federation does not pay Major League Soccer salaries).\\n\\nHow women players are compensated compared to the men\\n\\nThis is where things get very complicated. While the issue of establishing equal pay between the two teams seems like a matter of adjusting some numbers, the collective bargaining agreements for the men and women players detail differing pay structures.\\n\\nGabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane University, tells TIME it’s not that unusual that the mediation attempt ended unsuccessfully. “Many equal pay cases are complicated and are difficult issues to prove,” he says. “In many cases, the fight is over whether the jobs are similar, not over the level of pay. In this case, both questions are difficult: Are the jobs similar and is the pay equal? Are there factors other than gender leading to pay difference?”\\n\\nMaking a direct comparison between how much the men earned versus the women is difficult because of the different contracts signed by men and women players and other factors that come into play, according to Feldman. Among other things, players factor in the number of games they play, which tournaments they play in, the popularity of soccer in general and the money they make outside of soccer through sponsorships or other work to determine what they think is a fair amount to make, he says.\\n\\nWomen players under contract earn a base salary of $100,000 and can earn some bonuses based on game performance. Players on the men’s team only earn bonuses.\\n\\nIn the USWNT’s lawsuit, compensation models showed that if both teams won 20 games in a row, women would make 38% less than their male counterparts. That calculation was based on the women’s team’s prior collective bargaining agreement, which expired in December 2016. The Washington Post, which ran the numbers based on the new collective bargaining agreement that became effective in April 2017, found that if the women’s team won 20 games in a row, a player would earn $28,333 less, or about 89% of what a male player would make.\\n\\nThe Post noted that were both teams to lose all 20 games, they would make the same amount because the men receive a $5,000 bonus for losing and the women have a base salary.\\n\\nCompensation changes even further when it comes to the World Cup—though the pool money at stake here is set by FIFA, which gives prize winnings to the national federations behind each soccer team. For the Women’s World Cup, prize money totaled to $30 million in 2019, according to the Post. The USWNT earned about $4 million for winning the tournament. By contrast, the prize money pool for the 2018 Men’s World Cup totaled about $400 million, giving reigning champion France’s men’s team $38 million—more than the total pool for the women.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer offers bonuses to each team based on different wins throughout the World Cup tournament. The USWNT players each received about $250,000 in bonus payment for the World Cup, according to the Times. Under the men’s team’s collective bargaining agreement, players receive $3,000 more if they lose a Wold Cup qualifying match than what women earn for winning, the Post reports.\\n\\nCarli Lloyd #10 of the United States celebrates her goal with Tobin Heath #17 and Crystal Dunn #19, to take a 3-0 lead over the Republic of Ireland, during the first half of the first game of the USWNT Victory Tour at Rose Bowl on August 03, 2019 in Pasadena, California. Harry How—Getty Images\\n\\nWhat will happen next in the USWNT equal pay lawsuit\\n\\nThe case is likely to be settled in a trial, according to Feldman. U.S. Soccer will be responsible for proving that any gaps in pay are a result of “good faith negotiation,” Feldman says. U.S. Soccer will try to make the case that the pay gap boils down to the two different collective bargaining agreements agreed to by each team under their separate players’ associations, he says. They will have to show that the current situation is “just a product of collective bargaining.”\\n\\nU.S. Soccer and the USWNT disagree both on how much the players get paid and on how such payments are quantified when compared with what male players receive. “The federation says, among other things, that it’s apples to oranges,” says Feldman. “There is not one right answer to what is fair—the answer is in what they agreed [in the collective bargaining agreements]. It’s not like a math formula will give you the right amount.”\\n\\nFor the women players, he says, the challenge will be to prove that the gaps are a product of gender discrimination.\\n\\n“One of the threshold issues is that there’s no agreement on what the relative levels of pay are,” Feldman says. “[U.S. Soccer] claims the women are making just as much if not more than the men. They have to prove they are getting paid less and then prove that the disparity is attributable to gender discrimination and not other gender neutral factors.”\\n\\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.\""

       "  'text': 'To understand the impact of a component-based design and how it enables us to develop faster on the Twitter web codebase, we’ll need to take a step back. Not too long ago when you opened up Twitter it was a lot more “square”, from borders to buttons to avatars. When it came time to do a design refresh in 2017, we needed to coordinate the change across all of our clients: the Android and iOS apps, the desktop website, and the mobile website. Updating the design of the legacy desktop website took many engineers two months to complete. One particularly painful change probably sounds like it should have been quite trivial: rounding the edges of buttons. But because the legacy website had no universal button component and many different variations even within re-used button code, this involved manually updating and visually verifying 442 different instances of buttons. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. In contrast, the redesign on the new Twitter web codebase took far fewer engineers only two weeks. For rounding buttons, only the core button component needed to be updated and those changes propagated to the rest of the app, since every button instance used a standard component rather than defining a custom implementation. With that context, let’s talk a bit about the benefits of components more broadly. You probably know what a component is: a self-contained implementation of a piece of an app’s UI (button is one, username is another). Our new React-based web app is built from more than a hundred components, many of which are themselves created using simpler building block components. Extracting out UI presentation and interaction logic into an isolated component makes it easier to reuse, modify, and test. It also provides an opportunity to be intentional about its API (more on that later). For additional encapsulation we define each component’s styles in JavaScript within that component (we rely on the StyleSheet API from react-native-web), which means no bleeding of CSS class styles or need to be careful with import order so that styles are not improperly overridden--a frequent source of headaches on our old codebase. The web app takes this a step further and has the concept of a stylesheet theme, which components use as the source of truth for design constants like colors. These themes can then be swapped out to easily toggle between different modes. Today, this is what we do for switching to “dark” and “lights out” modes. Using a component-based design provides the opportunity to create a shared vocabulary between design and engineering that can be used to speed product delivery and improve user experience consistency. We’ve accomplished this by building our components in a standalone library, which is documented using Storybook. The docs can be accessed internally by designers and developers to see which components are available for use, what they are called, what they can do, and how they behave. This means that when a designer is describing a new screen, they can hand the developer a wireframe that references various components used by the screen, and both know exactly what it describes. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. All of the components used in the Edit List screen already exist in our library, which means there was no need to create any new components to build this screen. With component-based design, development becomes an act of composition, rather than constantly reinventing the wheel. Using shared components as building blocks frees us up to focus on what matters, without getting bogged down in implementation details. Extracting our core components into the component library also means they can be reused outside of the web app, so that other Twitter teams working on web can leverage our work. Components as simple as “text” or as complex as our emoji picker are available for any internal team to use. The rich toolbox of available components has made the Twitter web app the development platform of choice during company-wide hack weeks. But component-based design and component libraries are only as good as the principles that drive them. Much like the universe itself, as client code matures and grows, there is a natural inclination towards entropy. We like to call this the “why don’t we just...” fallacy. “Why don’t we just add a special prop?” “Why don’t we just fork that component with some tweaks?” “Why don’t we just make a one-off component for this custom UI logic?” None of those are inherently wrong in isolation. Sometimes it makes sense to expand a component’s API or for special UI logic unique to a particular area of the code, like Direct Messages, to be implemented with the screen itself. Where it becomes a problem is when those extra fields and forked/one-off components build up over time at the cost of consistency and maintainability. For that reason, we encourage designers and developers alike to push back against that inclination and to simplify whenever possible, even at the cost of flexibility. To give an example, at one point, the button component’s API had become highly customizable to a fault. Developers could specify the label color, background color, and border color independently, which made for a very large set of possible button looks. One of our principles is to make opinionated components that support visual consistency so in this case we opted to distill those three options into a single choice, a type field that only allows choosing from a predefined set of valid button appearances. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. We strive to maintain a high standard of quality for code extracted to our component library. Components must support internationalization, look correct in RTL languages, and be accessible to screen readers out of the box. They should also have fully fleshed-out documentation and tests and be typed. They must be intentional about their API. “Are all of the customization options necessary?” “Can we consolidate the variants to make it more opinionated and easy to use?” Asking these questions early saves headaches later, and it means we can use a component with the confidence that it “does the right thing” out of the box, even for tough edge cases like RTL and screen reader support. Adhering to these principles in our component-based design system has allowed us to develop and iterate quickly and with confidence from the early design phases through implementation. Building web at Twitter is easier to learn than ever, allowing us to ramp up new team members fast. And if we ever have to make avatars and buttons square again, that should hopefully only take one engineer one day…. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable.',\n",
       "  'structuredText': '<div> \\n <div> \\n  <p>To understand the impact of a component-based design and how it enables us to develop faster on the Twitter web codebase, we’ll need to take a step back. Not too long ago when you opened up Twitter it was a lot more “square”, from borders to buttons to avatars. When it came time to do a design refresh in 2017, we needed to coordinate the change across all of our clients: the Android and iOS apps, the desktop website, and the mobile website.</p> \\n  <p>Updating the design of the legacy desktop website took many engineers two months to complete. One particularly painful change probably sounds like it should have been quite trivial: rounding the edges of buttons. But because the legacy website had no universal button component and many different variations even within re-used button code, this involved manually updating and visually verifying 442 different instances of buttons.</p> \\n  <div>\\n    This Tweet is unavailable \\n  </div> \\n  <div> \\n   <div> \\n    <div>    \\n    </div> \\n    <div></div> \\n    <div> \\n     <div> \\n      <div>  \\n       <div>    \\n       </div>  \\n       <div>\\n         This Tweet is unavailable. \\n       </div> \\n      </div> \\n     </div> \\n    </div> \\n   </div> \\n  </div> \\n </div> \\n <div> \\n  <p>In contrast, the redesign on the new Twitter web codebase took far fewer engineers only two weeks. For rounding buttons, only the core button component needed to be updated and those changes propagated to the rest of the app, since every button instance used a standard component rather than defining a custom implementation.</p> \\n  <p>With that context, let’s talk a bit about the benefits of components more broadly. You probably know what a component is: a self-contained implementation of a piece of an app’s UI (button is one, username is another). Our new <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>-based web app is built from more than a hundred components, many of which are themselves created using simpler building block components.</p> \\n  <p>Extracting out UI presentation and interaction logic into an isolated component makes it easier to reuse, modify, and test. It also provides an opportunity to be intentional about its API (more on that later). For additional encapsulation we define each component’s styles in JavaScript within that component (we rely on the StyleSheet API from<a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web\"> react-native-web</a>), which means no bleeding of CSS class styles or need to be careful with import order so that styles are not improperly overridden--a frequent source of headaches on our old codebase.</p> \\n  <p>The web app takes this a step further and has the concept of a stylesheet theme, which components use as the source of truth for design constants like colors.

       "  'text': 'Transparency is a key guiding principle in our mission to serve the public conversation. For the past seven years, our biannual Twitter Transparency Report has highlighted trends in requests made to Twitter from around the globe. Over time, we have significantly expanded the information we disclose adding metrics on platform manipulation, Twitter Rules enforcement, and our proactive efforts to eradicate terrorist content, violent extremism, and child sexual exploitation from our service. We strongly believe in providing data and information that is straightforward and provides insights into the types of requests we receive from governments and others around the world. This is why we also upload legal requests directly into Lumen database, a long-term partnership with the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard. We encourage the public to explore this site to get a sense of the day-to-day queries we receive from governments and other entities around the world. Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of why we exist, and we hope that the larger and more granular datasets published in our Transparency Report provide you with information that can help you understand the political and social contours of how nation-states and their institutions interact with our company. We believe it is vital that the public see the demands we receive, and how we work to strike a balance between respecting local law, letting the Tweets flow, and protecting people from harm. We will continue to update our report with new data and evolve our commitment in this space, particularly around the Twitter Rules and our own enforcement. The below data points highlight some of the most important and interesting trends we’ve observed during this reporting period (July-December 2018). Global information requests (legal requests for account information): We received broadly the same number of information requests (combined emergency disclosure requests and non-emergency requests for account information) compared to the previous reporting period. The US submitted 6% fewer information requests than the last reporting period, with 58% fewer accounts specified. This contributed to the lower volume of accounts specified globally. Notably, the number of accounts specified worldwide decreased by 34%. We have received government information requests from 86 different countries. The United States now comprises only 30% of global government information requests and 35% of all global accounts specified in the same category. The second highest volume of information requests were submitted by Japan (24% of global information requests, comprising 20% of global accounts specified). Requests from the United Kingdom (13%), India (6%), Germany (6%), and France (5%) together account for 30% of all global information requests, and 29% of all global accounts specified. The volume of global emergency disclosure requests (EDRs) decreased by 2% since the last reporting period. For the first time since we began reporting, the United Kingdom submitted the greatest percentage of global EDRs (33%), followed by the United States (30%). Global removal requests (legal requests for content removal): Removal of terrorist contentDuring this reporting period, a total of 166,513 accounts were suspended for violations related to promotion of terrorism, which is a reduction of 19% from the volume shared in the previous reporting period. Of those suspensions, 91% consisted of accounts flagged by internal, purpose-built technological tools. The trend we are observing year-on-year is a steady decrease in terrorist organizations attempting to use our service. This is due to zero-tolerance policy enforcement that has allowed us to take swift action on ban evaders and other identified forms of behavior used by terrorist entities and their affiliates. In the majority of cases, we take action at the account setup stage — before the account even Tweets. We are encouraged by these metrics but will remain vigilant. Our goal is to stay one step ahead of emergent behaviors and new attempts to circumvent our robust approach. Removal of child sexual exploitationDuring this reporting period, we suspended a total of 456,989 unique accounts for violations related to child sexual exploitation, which is down 6% from the volume disclosed in the previous reporting period. Of those unique accounts suspended, 96% were surfaced by a combination of technology solutions, including PhotoDNA and internal proprietary tools. As standard and required by law, we continue to report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Alongside our other safety partners worldwide, NCMEC continue to play a critical role and we deeply value and appreciate the partnership. Platform manipulation*Proactive challenges of accounts for spammy behavior and platform manipulation have decreased by 17% in the second half of 2018 versus the first half, totalling 194 million challenges in the second half of 2018. Approximately 75% were subsequently automatically removed after failing our account challenge process. This is due to a range of factors, including our increased emphasis on detection of malicious activity at signup — stopping bad actors from ever getting to the stage of Tweeting — and positive external trends affecting the volume of this activity targeting Twitter. Aggregate reports of these types of behavior have also decreased in the second half of 2018, suggesting that people continue to experience fewer spammy interactions on Twitter. National security requestsAs in past reports, Twitter is only able to publish very limited information about national security requests due to legal prohibitions that we continue to challenge in court (see here for a full update on Twitter v. Barr, our ongoing transparency litigation). At this time we are able to share information about the number of National Security Letters (NSLs) received which are no longer subject to non-disclosure orders. We believe it is much more meaningful to publish these actual numbers than reporting in the bands authorized per the USA Freedom Act. During this reporting period we notified users affected by two additional NSLs after the gag orders were lifted. As reflected in the report, non-disclosure orders for 14 total NSLs have been lifted to date. Twitter is committed to continuing to use the legal mechanism available to us to request judicial review of these gag orders. More broadly, we are also committed to arguing that indefinite non-disclosure orders are unconstitutional in both the criminal and national security contexts. We view each request for judicial review as an opportunity to strengthen the legal precedent protecting our First Amendment rights. Twitter Rules enforcementAcross the six Twitter Rules policy categories included in this report, 16,388 accounts were reported by known government entities compared to 5,461 reported during the last reported period, an increase of 17%. We have a global team that manages enforcement of our Rules with 24/7 coverage, in every supported language on the service. It is worth noting that the raw number of reported accounts is not a consistent indicator of the validity of the reports we receive. During our review process, we may consider whether reported content violates aspects of the Twitter Rules beyond what was initially reported. For example, content reported as a violation of our private information policy may also be a violation of our policies for hateful conduct. If the content is determined to violate any Twitter Rule, it is actioned accordingly. Not all reported accounts are found to violate the Twitter Rules, and reported accounts may be found to violate a different rule than was initially reported. We may also determine that reported content does not violate the rules at all. The volumes often fluctuate significantly based on world events, including elections, national and international media stories, and large conversational moments in social and political culture. Legislative changesWe produce the Twitter Transparency Report to inform the public about the actions we take and the requests we receive from governments around the world. As the public discussion about regulation increases, we believe transparency is an essential part of ensuring you — the public — are able to see how these laws operate. Transparency is not just the responsibility of tech companies. Governments and regulators should be transparent about their own actions, enabling people to know if content has been removed because of a decision Twitter made, or because of a government request. This transparency is essential if we are to foster an informed debate and mitigate the risk of inappropriate use of state power. We encourage you to review our latest Twitter Transparency Report in depth and to follow the conversation over at @Policy. *A note about our previous report: We regularly review, refine, and iterate upon the data we collect and evaluate for the Twitter Transparency Report. Since we published our last report, we have moved to a different data source for tracking the number of spam and platform manipulation reports we receive from people who use Twitter. In our last report (covering January-June 2018), we shared that we received 4,020,893 spam reports. Based on our updated data source, we now believe that 3,606,533 reports the accurate number. Today we reflect these corrections as a revision to our previous report’s data.',\n",

At Twitter, we’re delighted to partner with the Earth Day Network, as well as share new commitments that our company is making to help address this pressing issue. From the first Earth Day in 1970, the annual event has grown from 20 million to more than 1 billion people participating in activities around the globe. We’re helping to promote a variety of campaigns on Twitter focused on increasing environmental awareness and education, as well as working to mobilize citizens around the movement. We’ve built and launched an emoji in celebration of #EarthDay that highlights key campaigns people are driving on Twitter including #ClimateAction, #EarthRise, and #VoteEarth. We’ve also donated pro bono advertising credits under our #AdsForGood program to help promote efforts leading up to Earth Day’s 50th Anniversary. As part of our commitment to making San Francisco — where our company is headquartered — a greener place, we’ve partnered with the San Francisco Parks Alliance. Today, Tweeps are volunteering to clean up and restore the habitat at Cayuga Park. We’ll also be bringing Tweeps together for volunteer initiatives in our offices around the globe as part of the “Great Global Clean Up” in May and #FridayForGood. Leading up to the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in 2020, Twitter is also making new commitments, including: Travel: We will begin to offset our carbon emissions for regular employee travel, as well as large-scale events like #OneTeam2020 and the #TweepTour. This program works by funding green energy projects around the world, managed through Cool Effect, a climate change nonprofit. Data Centers: Our data centers represent a significant piece of our carbon footprint. Our goal is to achieve 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. While we work to bring that online, we will also offset our current carbon emissions through Cool Effect. Plastic Use: We will minimize our use of plastic at Twitter events, as well as end the use of single-use bottles, utensils, and plates by 2020. Recycled Products: By year’s end, all Twitter offices will use 100% recycled paper products in the United States and globally by 2020. Composting: We will implement a new composting program in our U.S. offices by the end of 2020, building on the leadership of the green initiatives already underway in many of our offices worldwide. Office Build-Outs: We will continue to work closely with our Real Estate and Workplace team to ensure that we’re retrofitting and installing environmentally-friendly water faucets and achieving at least 95% “Green Certified” status and 100% Carbon Neutral Energy in our directly-leased buildings by 2025. Our EMEA HQ in Dublin office is already powered entirely by renewable energy. To achieve this, building aspects including water consumption, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and material selection were designed and installed in line with LEED’s guidelines and metrics. The team received an award for its leadership in the city. How can you participate? Start by joining the conversation using the dedicated hashtags, following the accounts mentioned here, and thinking of ways you can reduce your own carbon footprint at home and at work. We believe taking these steps are important but know we have more to do to. This is a global issue with global ramifications. We are committed to playing our part.',\n",

Most importantly, we’ve been working to champion those who use Twitter to build a thriving #RecoveryMovement. In 2017 alone, 70,237 people in the United States died from drug overdoses. Nearly 70 percent of those deaths involved opioids, surpassing the number of deaths resulting from traffic accidents. Last year, U.S. government leaders invited Twitter to collaborate on efforts to help combat the #OpioidCrisis. Twitter is committed to leveraging our resources and tools to help meet this important challenge. DEA #TakeBackDay Twitter is once again partnering with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) for its Take Back Day, a biannual campaign that encourages Americans to dispose of their prescription drugs at a local drop-off site in order to prevent drug misuse. The next #TakeBackDay in the United States is on April 27. Twitter has re-launched a custom emoji for #TakeBackDay and is coordinating with congressional leaders and Administration officials to raise awareness for this event on the platform. Last year, launching the custom #TakeBackDay emoji and the corresponding hashtags helped to elevate the conversation with 50x the engagement compared to previous years. In fall 2018, #TakeBackDay Tweets garnered more than 1 million impressions with the help of high-profile Tweets, including one from the First Lady of the United States. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. Working to prevent drug sales online We remove any Tweets offering to sell opioids and regulated drugs. We’ve ramped up the use of our anti-spam tools, deployed new, targeted technologies around this issue, and implemented additional internal processes to enforce the Twitter Rules regarding drug-related content. To inform our efforts, we’ve consulted expert researchers from leading institutions, government officials, and law enforcement entities. This work has resulted in the removal of more than 17,000 Tweets globally since mid-2018 for violating our rules related to illegal and regulated drug sales — included in that figure is attempted credit card scams and diet pill sales, as well as related spammy behaviors. In the next few weeks, we’ll be updating our rules so they’re shorter, simpler, and easier to understand. Included in that effort will be additional clarity regarding how we treat the sale of illegal and regulated drugs on Twitter. #RecoveryMovement According to a recent study conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, 2.5 million U.S. adults in recovery report recovery-related use of online technology and that interventions leveraging online technologies have enhanced outcomes for these individuals. We’ve developed strong partnerships with recovery researchers from leading academic institutions and advocates to shape our product and policy work. To support the people who are active in the #RecoveryMovement online, we’ve held events and supported on-platform engagement, including donating pro bono advertising awards through our #AdsForGood program. We invite government leaders, NGOs, advocates, and people in recovery to join us in celebrating #RecoveryMonth in September on Twitter. Collaboration to promote public healthWe’ve hosted events at Twitter's DC office with guests including the U.S. Surgeon General, members of Congress, Young People in Recovery President and CEO Justin Luke Riley, and Substance Use Disorders Institute Recovery Scientist Robert Ashford to discuss the opioid crisis and #RecoveryMovement. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. Last year, Twitter participated in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Online Opioid Summit in which we committed to taking stronger action against the availability of illegal online drug sales. We provided an update on our progress at a follow-up event at the FDA earlier this month. Nonprofits help to share public health information, conduct important research and create communities of support, oftentimes through online services. To support their efforts, we’ve conducted best practices training with organizations like Lily’s Place and The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids to enhance their effectiveness on Twitter. In November 2018, Twitter co-hosted an event with industry peers and The Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies featuring Dopesick author Beth Macy and representatives from the National Institutes of Health. We also participated in a panel discussing how the tech industry can continue to combat the opioid crisis. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. In San Francisco, we’re teaming up with the Saint Francis Foundation, the Harm Reduction Coalition, GLIDE, the Tenderloin Community Benefit District, and Gubbio Project — organizations that are all working toward a multifaceted approach to address the crisis. This year, we’re also keynoting Young People in Recovery’s 2019 conference and will provide training for the organization’s chapter leaders across the country. Our commitment continues We will continue to invest in tools and technology to improve the health of the conversation on Twitter, as well as build on our efforts with outside partners to ensure Twitter doing its part to help those with substance use disorders connect to recovery communities.

       "  'text': 'We want people to feel safe on Twitter. Last year, we shared that building a Twitter free of abuse, spam and other things that distract from the public conversation is our top priority. Since then, we’ve made strides in creating a healthier service. Today, we’re sharing an update on our progress and previewing some changes you can expect to see in the next few months. There will always be more to do, but we’ve made meaningful progress that is important to share. Here is a summary of progress we’ve made, with more detail on our proactive work below: 38% of abusive content that’s enforced is surfaced proactively to our teams for review instead of relying on reports from people on Twitter. 16% fewer abuse reports after an interaction from an account the reporter doesn’t follow. 100,000 accounts suspended for creating new accounts after a suspension during January-March 2019 –– a 45% increase from the same time last year. 60% faster response to appeals requests with our new in-app appeal process. 3 times more abusive accounts suspended within 24 hours after a report compared to the same time last year. 2.5 times more private information removed with a new, easier reporting process. Taking Action Without Reports People who don’t feel safe on Twitter shouldn’t be burdened to report abuse to us. Previously, we only reviewed potentially abusive Tweets if they were reported to us. We know that’s not acceptable, so earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse in addition to relying on people’s reports. This time last year, 0% of potentially abusive content was flagged to our teams for review proactively. Today, by using technology, 38% of abusive content that’s enforced is surfaced proactively for human review instead of relying on reports from people using Twitter. This encompasses a number of policies, such as abusive behavior, hateful conduct, encouraging self-harm, and threats, including those that may be violent. The same technology we use to track spam, platform manipulation and other rule violations is helping us flag abusive Tweets to our team for review. With our focus on reviewing this type of content, we’ve also expanded our teams in key areas and geographies so we can stay ahead and work quickly to keep people safe. Reports give us valuable context and a strong signal that we should review content, but we’ve needed to do more and though still early on, this work is showing promise. What’s to Come Keeping people safe on Twitter remains our top priority, and we have more changes coming to help us work toward that goal. Here’s some of what to expect in the coming months: We’ll continue to improve our technology to help us review content that breaks our rules faster and before it’s reported, specifically those who Tweet private information, threats, and other types of abuse. We’ll make it easier for people who use Twitter to share specifics when reporting so we can take action faster, especially when it comes to protecting people’s physical safety. Context on Tweets and our enforcement is important in understanding our rules, so we’ll add more notices within Twitter for clarity, such as if a Tweet breaks our rules but remains on the service because the content is in the public interest. We are updating our rules in the next few weeks so they’re shorter, simpler and easier to understand. Starting in June, we’ll be experimenting with ways to give people more control over their conversations by giving them an option to hide replies to their Tweets. We have more to do to ensure everyone feels safe on Twitter, and will keep sharing progress on @TwitterSafety.',\n",

This makes it a great place to build and foster a community. Twitter is also ‘what’s happening’. It’s where people go to follow the latest stories and events. This makes it a great place to engage your audience when they’re most receptive. But as well as offering marketers a great platform on which to reach consumers, Twitter has data that can inform marketing strategies on the platform itself and beyond. Because Twitter data is detailed and public it is invaluable to our customers who need to build a better understanding of their consumers using tools like Brandwatch Audiences. Even those in industries that might not expect a lot of direct engagement there can use insights from Twitter to better reach their target audiences online and offline. Building a meaningful marketing persona is hard work. Focus groups and market research are expensive undertakings, and often they take so long they’re out of date by the time anyone gets to look at them. Twitter data is a fantastic, real-time source of public opinion on pretty much anything, but there are millions of tweets sent every day. How do you know where to start looking? Here’s a simple five-minute guide for which audiences you should be identifying, how to define them, what you can discover from them, and what to do next.',\n",

Live on Twitter This season @MLB will be giving fans a unique opportunity to vote for which players’ at-bats they want to watch live on Twitter – every day. Each morning, @MLB will Tweet out a call for fans to choose which player will be the featured hitter that day. @MLB will then livestream every one of that player’s at-bats on Twitter for fans in the United States. This is scheduled to debut on Opening Day - Thursday, March 28 - and continue throughout the regular season. In addition, @MLB will broadcast live shows on Twitter around key tentpole events on the Major League Baseball calendar, including the London Series, Home Run Derby, All-Star Game from Cleveland, trade deadline, and the Postseason. Highlights of every home run For the first time this year, @MLB will post highlights of each and every home run hit during the season on Twitter, including capturing some of those in a specially-curated nightly video montage. MLB also will once again make near real-time game video highlights available for fans moments after they happen on the field from @MLB on Twitter, offering additional ways to follow all of the baseball action at home or on the go. Spanish-language highlights also will be available from @LasMayores, MLB’s official Spanish-language account, throughout 2019. Team emoji To help fans bring their baseball Tweets to life, special hashtag-triggered emojis for all 30 MLB teams will be back come Opening Day.

It has contributed to the democratisation of access to news and events in innovative and dynamic ways. Every single person has the potential to tell the world what's happening in their village, their town, their city, and their community. There are fewer barriers to full participation in the global conversation. While we firmly believe in the power of open, public conversation, the speed of the Internet presents unique challenges around media literacy and information quality. Building public capacities to analyse and discern what is and is not quality material is vital. As the European Commission says, a high level of media literacy is a key factor to enable citizens to make informed decisions in the digital age. This week marks the first ever #EUMediaLiteracyWeek, a new initiative driven by the Commission to promote skills required to navigate an increasingly complex information environment. Twitter is pleased to play its part in supporting and celebrating this important event. What we're doing across the EU Twitter’s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information. Journalists, experts and engaged citizens tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds. However, we do not rely on user interaction alone. As part of our work improving the health of the public conversation, we are focusing on product, policy and enforcement innovations to address the behaviours which detract from that conversation. We have updated and expanded our Rules to better reflect how we identify fake accounts, and continue to aggressively address malicious automation and other forms of platform manipulation. We’ve also signed the EU Code of Conduct on Disinformation with industry partners, and we are sponsoring and contributing to media literacy initiatives in many countries around the world, including in Europe. Here are some examples: Ireland (EMEA HQ) We’re supporting the #BeMediaSmart campaign run by the Media Literacy Network, an initiative of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. This campaign plays on how conscious we are of where our food comes from and asks that we give the same consideration to the sources of media we consume. We’ll be amplifying the reach of this campaign by supporting nonprofit partners with Ads for Good grants. Partners include the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and Webwise. Check out some Twitter resources on the campaign website at bemediasmart.ie/resources\",\n",

Last year, we set two year diversity targets, prioritizing the populations that have historically been underrepresented in tech and at Twitter: Women (globally), Black and Latinx (US). When we say we want our company to reflect our service, we've got a long way to go, but we've made solid progress towards our goals. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. Increasing workforce representation is only part of the story. In order to move the needle on diversity, we need to measure and understand our workforce holistically including hiring, attrition and retention. New hire results below are expressed as a percentage of total new hires in 2018. For example, 45.7% of all new hires in 2018 were Women. Here’s how we’re doing: This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. Each member of the leadership team has new A.I.R. (attract, retain, include) plans tailored to their orgs against these targets. With overall Women and Black representation up 1.8 and 1.1 percentage points respectively in 2018, and positive hiring and retention trends, we believe we’re on track to achieve our 2019 targets for both of these demographics. We have a lot of work to do with our overall Latinx representation, with improvement in 2018 at just 0.5 of a percentage point. We need to retain the amazing Tweeps we have, and we’ll focus on attracting new people. We will work closely with Twitter Alas, our Business Resource Group for Latinx employees and allies, the People team and external partners to help us close this gap with urgency. Beyond these three demographics, we continue to actively track and support representation across our workforce. Here are the broader breakdowns. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. Missing from this chart is sexual orientiation and gender identity because we had lower participation in our self-ID survey for this category. We believe a refresh of our self-identification efforts and a new anonymous survey will allow us to better understand and share a more accurate representation of our company moving forward. This will also put us in a position to report on representation for employees with disabilities and with military status. Our Business Resource Groups (Blackbirds, Twitter Alas, Twitter Asians, Twitter Open, Twitter Stripes, Twitter Women) are a critical force within the company. They tell our story through events and experiences, support our recruitment strategy, drive an inclusive culture, and ensure diversity is front and center in everything we do. This year, a new group is being formed to represent Tweeps with disabilities, as well as intersection groups to give Tweeps a safe space to discuss issues that matter to them. This Tweet is unavailable This Tweet is unavailable. When sharing details of future plans, we always want to get feedback and drive conversation. The below is a thread from Leslie Berland, our Head of People and Chief Marketing Officer. It focuses on transparency, accountability and organizational changes that we believe will set us up for a more inclusive and diverse Twitter in 2019 and beyond.

       "  'text': 'This May, millions of citizens from across the European Union’s (EU) 27 Member States will have their say on the future political complexion of the European Parliament. The second largest democratic exercise of its kind in the world in 2019, the European elections will have a major impact on the region’s geopolitical outlook and priorities for the next five years. Twitter is committed to serving the public conversation around this major global event. As a real-time, live service, we seek to be the world’s window into the critical conversations happening right across Twitter between candidates, voters, journalists, political parties and groups, civil society, and electoral commissions. We’re already working proactively to support and protect these conversations, and today we’re detailing some of the additional steps we’re taking ahead of #EUElections2019. Expanding our political campaigning ads policy across all Member States Our political campaigning ads policy is being expanded to cover #EUElections2019, providing the general public with an additional layer of insight into who is running a political campaign ad on Twitter. The policy, which is also being expanded into India and Australia today, means that an ad endorsing a party or a candidate will be viewable in our Ads Transparency Center, where you will be able to see details such as billing information, ad spend, and impressions data per Tweet. Additionally, we will be showing demographic targeting data for the ads being served. The ads will exist indefinitely within the Transparency Center, where they are viewable by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they own a Twitter account. In addition to the information being shared within the Ads Transparency Center itself, we are making it clearer who is advertising European political campaign content on Twitter by including a visual label and disclaimer information on promoted content from certified accounts. This will allow users to easily identify political campaign ads and to know who paid for them. To qualify for the policy, candidates, organisations, and individuals seeking to advertise political campaigning content must now undergo a thorough certification process. Once proof of identity is verified, and advertisers meet our eligibility requirements, a letter with an access code will be posted to their address to confirm they are located within the EU. This will ensure that only EU-based individuals can advertise political campaign content on the service. Enforcement of this policy will begin on 11 March, after which only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads on our service. Political advertisers must apply now for certification and go through every step of the process. Guidelines for political advertisers can be found here. We will expand this policy to country-level elections in the future, as our teams continue to develop their operational and tooling support. Cross-functional European elections team In addition to increased transparency around political ads, we’ve also formed a high-level internal elections group to lead our electoral integrity work in the region from now until polling day. Using our proprietary-built internal tools, the team will proactively protect the integrity of regional trends, support partner escalations, and identify potential threats from malicious actors. Cross-functional by design, the team consists of several of the company’s top trust and safety experts, as well as members of our site integrity, legal, engineering, data science investigations, and our public policy teams in Europe. This blend of perspectives, expertise and backgrounds is absolutely critical. It also mirrors the model we put in place for the internal teams who directed our proactive efforts during recent elections in Germany, Sweden, Mexico, the U.S., and Brazil. As we move forward, we will continue with this model of bringing in additional expertise and personnel who can augment our approach, growing the experience level from one critical election to the next. Promoting media literacy and healthy campaigning on Twitter In the coming weeks and months, our public policy team across Europe will ramp up their engagement with political parties and the EU’s local Member State offices to arrange Twitter trainings, distribute media literacy resources, and to promote healthy, constructive participation in the democratic process. We’ll continue to identify candidates for verification, amplify campaigns that encourage voter participation and launch a special election emoji to encourage engagement and conversation. We’ll provide updates on this work when we have more information. Further recent election integrity efforts by Twitter include: Signing up to the EU Code of Conduct on Disinformation, and forming a global partnership with @UNESCO to promote better media literacy among citizens. Introducing new policies on fake accounts and hacked materials, and updating our spam reporting flow to enable the public to provide more granular information when reporting to us. Donating to the @DisinfoEU, @AtlanticCouncil and @NDI, all of which are doing meaningful work on #EUElections2019. Empowering independent research of foreign influence campaigns in places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela to develop a shared understanding of these threats and tactics. As the world’s window into the public conversation around #EUElections2019, Twitter is prepared to play its part in enhancing access to healthy democratic discourse.',\n",
