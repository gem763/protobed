      "\n",
      "Hearn also believes the country's growing population -- over 34 million -- can give boxing a platform to reach new levels of popularity.\n",
      "\n",

       "'Hong Kong’s summer of political unrest is going global.\\n\\nIn Toronto, Chinese flags flutter out the side of pricey convertibles, engines revving loudly. In Edinburgh, Beijing backers belt out lyrics from a Taiwanese pop song to exhort Hong Kong to listen to its “mother”—the Chinese Communist Party, in this version. And in Vancouver, about 60 pro-China demonstrators surround a quiet church where churchgoers have gathered to pray for the protesters in Hong Kong.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Chinese demonstrators have attracted attention in cities across the Western world by staging boisterous, at times aggressive, rallies in support of Beijing’s stance on the antigovernment protests that have roiled Hong Kong for almost three months. It is globalizing a standoff that had, until now, been largely confined to the internet and Hong Kong itself.\\n\\nPatriotic displays by overseas Chinese are hardly a new phenomenon. But the reach of the pro-Chinese demonstrations has grown as natives of mainland China study and work in the West in ever-greater numbers.\\n\\nA pro-China protester in London. Photo: Pete Maclaine/i-Images/Zuma Press\\n\\nThe fight is splitting diaspora communities in cities across the West with large ethnic Chinese populations, including New York, Boston, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Paris, Sydney and Melbourne.\\n\\nBy taking the fight to the West, pro-Beijing protesters are seeking to counter what they regard as a bias toward the Hong Kong demonstrators, while exercising a freedom that is far more limited back home.\\n\\nTheir sometimes aggressive tactics, taking a cue from the Communist Party’s own increasingly strident rhetoric against Hong Kong’s protests, threaten a backlash in the West and raise questions about Beijing’s approach to projecting soft power under President Xi Jinping.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Nathan Law, a former Hong Kong lawmaker and prominent pro-democracy activist who is studying for a graduate degree at Yale University, posted screenshots on Twitter of death threats that he received, written in Chinese.\\n\\nWhat started off as a demonstration against a controversial extradition bill has become a series of massive protests with broad political demands. Here is why so many Hong Kongers keep taking to the streets in a leaderless movement and whether their goals can be achieved. Photo: Thomas Peter/Reuters\\n\\n“They abuse the freedom of speech and internet freedom, which they don’t enjoy in their home country, to spread terror misinformation,” Mr. Law wrote, adding that campus and local police officials had responded to his complaints.\\n\\nIn Boston, Frances Hui, organizer of a pro-Hong Kong march last Sunday, said participants were assaulted and stalked by pro-Beijing demonstrators.\\n\\nThe pro-Chinese demonstrations are a direct response to gatherings organized by supporters of the Hong Kong protesters, whose initial demands have expanded into a broader fight about the nature of Chinese rule in the former British colony, now a semiautonomous Chinese territory.\\n\\nAs the protests in Hong Kong have escalated, so has the sophistication of overseas activity by Beijing’s supporters abroad.\\n\\nThe apparent high level of coordination has prompted questions about whether the Chinese government is directing them through its diplomatic missions or its overseas influence arm, the United Front Work Department.\\n\\nA rally in Canada’s Vancouver. Photo: DARRYL DYCK/Associated Press\\n\\nTwitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. on Monday suspended accounts believed to be part of a coordinated Chinese effort to undermine antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, marking the first time the social-media companies have pointed to China as a source of disinformation campaigns. China denies the charge.\\n\\nIn New York, Anna Cheung, convener of a pro-Hong Kong advocacy group, said while the group was able to hold earlier events without incident, she received threats of violence before the group’s most recent rally last week, prompting her to file a police report.\\n\\n“This is not by coincidence,” said Ms. Cheung, of NY4HK, or New Yorkers Supporting Hong Kong. “We believe there is a machinery behind this and they do it to all the cities to try to intimidate us.”\\n\\nTom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Britain’s House of Commons, says Chinese protesters have the right, like anyone else, to air their views, but “these cannot become simply forms of state-sponsored attempts at silencing freedom of speech in the U.K.”\\n\\nIn Australia, a close trading partner of China and a popular destination for Chinese students, serious clashes erupted last month. Three officials at Canberra’s Department of Home Affairs said Wednesday that authorities, including intelligence agencies, were investigating whether the counter-rallies had been planned by Chinese diplomatic missions.\\n\\nLarge-scale peaceful marches in Hong Kong have attracted hundreds of thousands of people. Photo: Kyle Lam/Bloomberg News\\n\\n“There is a lot of concern that these rallies may have had organizational support from Chinese officials here, because it has happened in the past,” said one of the officials who had knowledge of the investigation but wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. “There are some indications that these protests have the same involvement.”\\n\\nFollowing clashes at the University of Queensland in Brisbane last month, Xu Jie, the Chinese consul-general in the city, praised pro-Beijing students for confronting what he called “anti-China separatist” protesters with “ulterior motives.”\\n\\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, asked about any role that Beijing may have played in organizing overseas protests, said Thursday that all people in China and Hong Kong were united in a desire to “stop chaos and violence and restore order to Hong Kong.”\\n\\n“This is the collective will of 1.4 billion Chinese people,” he said. “Do you think the will of 1.4 billion people can be organized or controlled?”\\n\\nEven without encouragement from Beijing, many mainland Chinese studying abroad share the official Chinese view. Despite unfettered access to news sources, they believe that Hong Kong’s protesters, guided by the “black hand” of America, are seeking independence. But that is in fact a fringe demand among demonstrators.\\n\\nProtesters in Hong Kong have been throwing back rounds of tear gas at police. Photo: anthony wallace/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\\n\\n“As a Chinese student overseas, resolutely safeguarding the unity of the motherland is something we should be doing,” said one student in Berlin surnamed Zhang, who declined to give his first name. “We will fight all separatist behavior to the end.”\\n\\nThe genuine ardor of many pro-Beijing protesters highlights just how successful the Communist Party’s patriotic education campaigns have been in molding the worldview of college-aged Chinese nationals now living abroad, says Alex Joske, an expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank in Canberra.\\n\\nIsaac Huo, a 28-year-old who works in public relations, attended a pro-Beijing demonstration in Sydney last week after reading about it on WeChat , a popular Chinese messaging app. He spent 30 minutes at the rally, chanting slogans affirming his love for China and Hong Kong.\\n\\nMr. Huo, a native of southern China who moved to Australia more than 10 years ago, said it was important to be there because he felt people in Hong Kong had been misled into opposing Beijing.\\n\\n“We are brothers and sisters, so what’s the point of fighting against each other?” he said.\\n\\n—Rob Taylor, Kim Mackrael, Xiao Xiao, Jeremy Page and Shan Li contributed to this article.\\n\\nWrite to Philip Wen at philip.wen@wsj.com and Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com'"

       "\"Mediation between the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team and U.S. Soccer broke down this week, putting into question the future of the team’s fight over equal pay.\\n\\nPlayers with the USWNT sued U.S. Soccer in March, accusing the federation of not compensating or treating them in a manner equivalent to what the men’s team received. Mediation began in New York this week as representatives from both sides met to discuss compensation and treatment—but the efforts came to a seemingly abrupt stop on Wednesday. USWNT spokesperson Molly Levinson said they ended the meetings “sorely disappointed in the federation’s determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior.”\\n\\nShe added that the ongoing dispute over pay disparity is likely to end up in a trial.\\n\\n“It is clear that USSF, including its Board of Directors and President Carlos Cordeiro, fully intend to continue to compensate women players less than men. They will not succeed,” Levinson said. “We want all of our fans, sponsors, peers around the world, and women everywhere to know we are undaunted and will eagerly look forward to a jury trial.”\\n\\nRepresentatives for U.S. Soccer did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment. In a statement to CNN, the organization said, “We have said numerous times that our goal is to find a resolution, and during mediation we had hoped we would be able to address the issues in a respectful manner and reach an agreement.”\\n\\nHere’s what to know about the USWNT’s ongoing fight for equal pay.\\n\\nWhat the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team players want\\n\\nIn a class action lawsuit filed in March and signed by 28 players on the USWNT, the women allege that they are consistently paid less than the players on the men’s team and discriminated against because of their gender, despite a strong performance record.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was part of a years-long battle between the USWNT and U.S. Soccer regarding equal pay and gender equality. In 2016, five of the team’s players filed a complaint over unequal pay and bonuses with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In 2017, the players signed a new collective-bargaining agreement with the soccer federation and won control over some licensing and marketing rights. But the USWNT says that agreement did not go far enough.\\n\\n“Despite continued discrimination, we do feel like we have made progress toward a more collaborative way of operating. And yet, while we made progress in our compensation terms, we were still unable to achieve equal treatment with the Men’s National Team in the CBA we ratified in April 2017,” they wrote in a letter to the federation Monday ahead of the mediation.\\n\\nNow, following years of frustration between the players and the federation, the USWNT is pointing to their successes and widespread popularity as one factor in the push for equal pay. They’ve won four of eight World Cup titles since the championship games began in 1991 and four Olympic gold medals since the first women’s soccer tournament in 1996.\\n\\nIn their letter to U.S. Soccer, the women’s team pointed to their “remarkable” success during the 2019 World Cup. “We witnessed higher revenue numbers, higher ratings, more fans, more enthusiasm,” the players wrote. “The tired, arcane, irrelevant arguments and protestations of the male-dominated soccer world fell apart during those weeks.”\\n\\nThey added: “For both parties, the risk of not resolving our disagreements over equal treatment that were not addressed either in bargaining or through the EEOC is too high.”\\n\\nMegan Rapinoe of the USA lifts the FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy following her team's victory in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup France Final match between The United States of America and The Netherlands at Stade de Lyon on July 07, 2019 in Lyon, France. Alex Grimm—Getty Images\\n\\nWhat U.S. Soccer has said\\n\\nIn an open letter issued after the lawsuit was filed, the U.S. Soccer said it surprised by the complaint and that it had increased its investment in the women’s team in recent years.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer denied the women players’ claims in a court filing in May, saying the gap in pay stems from “differences in aggregate revenue generated by the different teams and/or any other factor other than sex,” arguing that the men’s and women’s teams are “physically and functionally separate organizations,” the Washington Post reported in July.\\n\\nAfter the World Cup, U.S. Soccer hired two lobbying firms in Washington D.C. to deny the claims of unequal pay in front of Congress, which sought to require the federation to pay both teams equally, according to a Politico report. While the U.S. government does not fund U.S. Soccer, the USWNT’s fight over equal pay has attracted attention from lawmakers. More than 50 members of Congress sent a letter to U.S. Soccer decrying the unequal treatment alleged by the USWNT. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin tied the equal pay issue into a bill he introduced that would withhold federal funding for the men’s 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, until the pay dispute was resolved.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer’s move to hire lobbyists was criticized by both the mens and women’s teams.\\n\\nAt the end of July, U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro argued that the women’s team has actually been paid more than the men’s team, saying that the federation paid the USWNT $34.1 million in salaries and game bonuses, while the men received $26.4 million. The figures, compiled by U.S. Soccer and based on an analysis by the federation’s staff, did not include the benefits, such as health care and a 401(k), that female players get. (Men are not provided the same benefits, according to the federation). U.S. Soccer’s numbers also included National Women’s Soccer League salaries that U.S. Soccer pays, which were negotiated in the 2017 CBA. (The federation does not pay Major League Soccer salaries).\\n\\nHow women players are compensated compared to the men\\n\\nThis is where things get very complicated. While the issue of establishing equal pay between the two teams seems like a matter of adjusting some numbers, the collective bargaining agreements for the men and women players detail differing pay structures.\\n\\nGabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane University, tells TIME it’s not that unusual that the mediation attempt ended unsuccessfully. “Many equal pay cases are complicated and are difficult issues to prove,” he says. “In many cases, the fight is over whether the jobs are similar, not over the level of pay. In this case, both questions are difficult: Are the jobs similar and is the pay equal? Are there factors other than gender leading to pay difference?”\\n\\nMaking a direct comparison between how much the men earned versus the women is difficult because of the different contracts signed by men and women players and other factors that come into play, according to Feldman. Among other things, players factor in the number of games they play, which tournaments they play in, the popularity of soccer in general and the money they make outside of soccer through sponsorships or other work to determine what they think is a fair amount to make, he says.\\n\\nWomen players under contract earn a base salary of $100,000 and can earn some bonuses based on game performance. Players on the men’s team only earn bonuses.\\n\\nIn the USWNT’s lawsuit, compensation models showed that if both teams won 20 games in a row, women would make 38% less than their male counterparts. That calculation was based on the women’s team’s prior collective bargaining agreement, which expired in December 2016. The Washington Post, which ran the numbers based on the new collective bargaining agreement that became effective in April 2017, found that if the women’s team won 20 games in a row, a player would earn $28,333 less, or about 89% of what a male player would make.\\n\\nThe Post noted that were both teams to lose all 20 games, they would make the same amount because the men receive a $5,000 bonus for losing and the women have a base salary.\\n\\nCompensation changes even further when it comes to the World Cup—though the pool money at stake here is set by FIFA, which gives prize winnings to the national federations behind each soccer team. For the Women’s World Cup, prize money totaled to $30 million in 2019, according to the Post. The USWNT earned about $4 million for winning the tournament. By contrast, the prize money pool for the 2018 Men’s World Cup totaled about $400 million, giving reigning champion France’s men’s team $38 million—more than the total pool for the women.\\n\\nU.S. Soccer offers bonuses to each team based on different wins throughout the World Cup tournament. The USWNT players each received about $250,000 in bonus payment for the World Cup, according to the Times. Under the men’s team’s collective bargaining agreement, players receive $3,000 more if they lose a Wold Cup qualifying match than what women earn for winning, the Post reports.\\n\\nCarli Lloyd #10 of the United States celebrates her goal with Tobin Heath #17 and Crystal Dunn #19, to take a 3-0 lead over the Republic of Ireland, during the first half of the first game of the USWNT Victory Tour at Rose Bowl on August 03, 2019 in Pasadena, California. Harry How—Getty Images\\n\\nWhat will happen next in the USWNT equal pay lawsuit\\n\\nThe case is likely to be settled in a trial, according to Feldman. U.S. Soccer will be responsible for proving that any gaps in pay are a result of “good faith negotiation,” Feldman says. U.S. Soccer will try to make the case that the pay gap boils down to the two different collective bargaining agreements agreed to by each team under their separate players’ associations, he says. They will have to show that the current situation is “just a product of collective bargaining.”\\n\\nU.S. Soccer and the USWNT disagree both on how much the players get paid and on how such payments are quantified when compared with what male players receive. “The federation says, among other things, that it’s apples to oranges,” says Feldman. “There is not one right answer to what is fair—the answer is in what they agreed [in the collective bargaining agreements]. It’s not like a math formula will give you the right amount.”\\n\\nFor the women players, he says, the challenge will be to prove that the gaps are a product of gender discrimination.\\n\\n“One of the threshold issues is that there’s no agreement on what the relative levels of pay are,” Feldman says. “[U.S. Soccer] claims the women are making just as much if not more than the men. They have to prove they are getting paid less and then prove that the disparity is attributable to gender discrimination and not other gender neutral factors.”\\n\\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.\""

       "  'language': 'en',\n",
       "  'text': 'MITT ROMNEY IS STARTING TO PAY TAXES ON HIS GIANT IRA. The former GOP presidential candidate turned 70 1/2 last year, forcing him to start taking money out of the retirement account that drew attention during his 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney’s 2017 tax return, released as he runs for Senate in Utah, shows $1.7 million in distributions from individual retirement accounts. During the 2012 campaign, his IRA contained between $20.7 million and $101.6 million, according to his financial disclosures. His most recent disclosure said his IRA accounts contained between $33 million and $150 million. Given annual contribution limits, it can be difficult to accumulate even the lower amounts in that wide range inside a tax-advantaged account. In a traditional IRA, pretax money goes in and is taxed as ordinary income when it comes out. Mr. Romney was a private equity executive at Bain Capital who invested in the firm’s deals through his retirement account, though his IRAs now consist largely of Goldman Sachs funds. The $1.7 million was Mr. Romney’s required minimum distribution, an aide said. That means his total IRA balance was likely about $46 million at the end of 2016, said IRA specialist Ed Slott. The minimum distributions are designed to make sure the income in retirement accounts is tax-deferred, not tax-free. BUT PEOPLE TURNING AGE 70 1/2 CAN DELAY all or part of their first mandatory distributions to the following April, Mr. Slott said. In Mr. Romney’s case, waiting to take mandatory distributions until 2018 could potentially have saved him money because the GOP tax law dropped the top tax rate from 39.6% to 37%. The aide said Mr. Romney didn’t defer any distributions and that changes to itemized deductions would have made any tax savings immaterial. On the other hand, Mr. Romney could have taken out more than the mandatory amount. His 2015 return, also released by his campaign, showed a $4.2 million IRA distribution before his mandatory starting date. That money was donated to charity and was distributed from the IRA as part of planning for Mr. Romney’s donations and estate, the aide said. Ultimately, the IRA itself will be left to charity, the aide said. The adjusted gross income reported by Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, ranged from $20 million in 2016 to $41.5 million in 2015. That was enough to put them in the top 0.01% of households (about 14,000) but not quite in the top 0.001% (about 1,400), according to IRS data. Mr. Romney’s combined federal tax rate over the period was 22%. That’s lower than the top income tax rate of 39.6% in those years for two main reasons. Most of Mr. Romney’s income comes from capital gains and dividends taxed at a top rate of 23.8%. Additionally, Mr. Romney donated more than $9 million to charity over that period, according to the campaign.',\n",

       "  'text': 'THE TWO LEADING CANDIDATES to be Georgia’s next governor attacked each other Tuesday night, with Democrat Stacey Abrams saying Republican Brian Kemp created “an atmosphere of fear” among some minorities trying to vote, and Mr. Kemp saying Ms. Abrams was running “the most dishonest campaign Georgians have ever seen.” The campaign debate, which also included Libertarian candidate Ted Metz, was the first time the candidates met publicly in a campaign that has become one of the most closely watched, and heated, in the nation. It remained relatively civil despite the barbs. Ms. Abrams, 44 years old, a former state House minority leader, is seeking to become the first black female governor in U.S. history. Mr. Kemp, 54 and Georgia’s secretary of state, is seeking to continue GOP control of the governorship, which the party has held since 2003. Ms. Abrams and her supporters have accused Mr. Kemp, who oversees elections in his current position, of working to suppress the minority vote. Mr. Kemp and his supporters have accused Ms. Abrams of advocating a loosening of election laws so that even noncitizens might vote. The issue of voting came up throughout the hour-long debate, including mention of about tens of thousands of pending applications that the secretary of state’s office hasn’t processed. The office has cited incomplete or inaccurate information on the forms. “Voter suppression isn’t only about blocking the vote,” Ms. Abrams said. “It’s also about creating an atmosphere of fear, making people worry their votes won’t count.” Mr. Kemp said many of those applications were submitted by the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration effort started by Ms. Abrams, and were inaccurate, including one applicant who signed their name “Jesus,” living on “Heaven Street.” “She is blaming me for a problem that her group created,” Mr. Kemp said, adding, “It’s never been easier to vote.” The two disagreed on a range of issues, including expansion of Medicaid, which Ms. Abrams supports and Mr. Kemp opposes, and state college scholarships for the children of illegal immigrants, which Ms. Abrams supports and Mr. Kemp opposes. Mr. Metz advocated hemp farms to revive the rural economy. The DEBATE TOOK PLACE AS THE BITTER CONTEST between the two candidates intensified this week. On Monday, the New York Times reported Ms. Abrams and other college students burned the Georgia State Flag in 1992 in protest over its Confederate battle emblem. The state eventually removed the emblem. Her critics on social media jumped on the account as proof she is “radical.” Mr. Kemp’s campaign spokesman declined to comment on the flag incident, except to say Mr. Kemp is fighting against \"San Francisco socialists and liberal billionaires from New York” who are seeking to “advance their extreme agenda in Georgia.” Ms. Abrams was part of a “permitted, peaceful protest” that occurred while “Georgia was at a crossroads, struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues,” her campaign said in a statement. On Tuesday, Rolling Stone magazine reported it obtained a recording of a speech Mr. Kemp gave recently to supporters. In it, he reportedly said Ms. Abrams’s supporters sent in an “unprecedented number” of mail-in ballots, “which is something that continues to concern us, especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote — which they absolutely can — and mail those ballots in, we gotta have heavy turnout to offset that.” Ms. Abrams’s supporters jumped on the quote as proof that the person running Georgia’s election didn’t want people to vote. Mr. Kemp’s backers said he was simply trying to urge his supporters to go to the polls. Mr. Kemp’s spokesman said in an email that the candidate was simply telling supporters that \"we must turn out our voters to offset the Left\\'s Get Out The Vote efforts.\" — Cameron McWhirter',\n",

Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), who this summer was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that he and his wife had used campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filed false campaign records, is fundraising at a clip similar to his recent prior races. For the quarter ended in September, Mr. Hunter raised $132,531 in his Republican-leaning district, California\\'s 50th. President Trump won the district by 15 points in 2016, and Mr. Hunter was one of the president\\'s earliest congressional backers. In that year\\'s quarter ended September, Mr. Hunter raised $123,700. During the same period in 2014, he raised $139,741. Mr. Hunter also faces a well-financed opponent in Ammar Campa-Najjar. In the most recent quarter, Mr. Campa-Najjar raised $1.4 million, according to the newest FEC reports, making him one of many Democratic challengers to outraise GOP incumbents. The Cook Political Report, citing the indictment, over the summer moved the race to \"lean Republican\" column after previously rating it a \"solid\" seat for the GOP. HOWEVER: Rep. Christopher Collins, a Republican congressman from New York who was arrested over the summer and charged with participating in an insider-trading scheme, raised just $32,755 in the quarter. That compares with $134,655 Mr. Collins raised in the comparable 2016 quarter. Mr. Collins has said he would remain on the ballot in November, running for re-election against Democrat Nate McMurray, who pulled in $519,846 in the latest quarter. Cook rates that race as also leaning in the GOP\\'s favor. In New Jersey, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in 2015 that led to a mistrial last year, outraised former pharmaceutical executive and Republican challenger Bob Hugin — excluding a $8,500,000 loan Mr. Hugin made to his own campaign during the quarter. That race is leaning in Mr. Menendez\\'s favor, thanks in part to a slate of down-ballot races.',\n",
